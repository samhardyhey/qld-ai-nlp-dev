"<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><span>  THE  MORETON  BAY  COURIER.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  SEPTEMBER  12,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  time,  we  trust,  is  not  far  distant,</span><span>  when  the  venerable  gentleman  who  is</span><span>  nominally  the  Representative  of  the  great</span><span>  electoral  district  of  Gloucester,  Macquarie,</span><span>  and  Stanley,  will  mark  his  sense  of  duty</span><span>  to  his  adopted  country  and  his  consti-</span><span>  tuents  by  tendering  his  resignation.*  An</span><span>  allusion  to  the  privileges  and  duties  we</span><span>  shall  be  shortly  called  upon  to  exercise,</span><span>  will  not,  therefore,  be  out  of  place.</span></p> <p><span>  Thanks  to  our  magnificent  district,</span><span>  thanks  to  the  wealth  and  energy  of  an</span><span>  enterprising  and  intelligent  community,</span><span>  our  franchisial  claims  are  no  longer  in-</span><span>  significant.  From  the  small  number  of</span><span>  twelve  votes,  given  by  the  electors  of</span><span>  Stanley  at  the  time  of  Mr.  McLeay's  re-</span><span>  turn  to  the  Legislative  Council,  the  elec-</span><span>  toral  roll  prepared  by  the  Chief  Constable</span><span>  in  April  last  showed  that  there  were  then</span><span>  resident  in  the  county  fifty-seven  persons</span></p> <p><span>  entitled  to  a  voice  in  our  Colonial  Assem-</span></p> <p><span>  bly.  And  so  considerable  has  been  the</span><span>  influx  of  population  during  the  present</span><span>  year,  that  their  number  has  since  greatly</span></p> <p><span>  increased.</span></p> <p><span>  The  possession  of  an  estate  in  freehold</span><span>  in  lands  or  tenements,  situate  within  the</span><span>  district,  of  the  clear  value  of  £200,  above</span><span>  all  charges  and  incumbrances,  or  the</span><span>  occupancy  of  a  house  rated  at  a  rent-value</span><span>  of  £20  a-year,  constitutes  the  electoral</span><span>  qualification.  This  possession  of  estate,</span><span>  or  house  tenancy,  must,  however,  date  at</span></p> <p><span>  least  six  months  before  the  date  of  the  last</span></p> <p><span>  registration.  Voters  must  be  of  full  age</span><span>    —  and  British  subjects,  either  by  birth,</span><span>  naturalization,  or  holding  letters  of  deni</span><span>  zation.  Emancipists,  who  have  received</span><span>  free  or  conditional  pardons,  are  also  en-</span><span>  titled  to  vote,  when  otherwise  qualified.</span></p> <p><span>  The  electoral  list  is  prepared  yearly,</span><span>  between  the  10th  March  and  10th  April,</span><span>  by  the  Chief  Constable,  and  is  delivered  by</span></p> <p><span>  him  to  the  Clerk  of  the  Bench.  The  Act</span></p> <p><span>  ""to  provide  for  the  division  of  New-South</span><span>  Wales  into  electoral  districts,  and  for  the</span><span>  election  of  members  to  serve  in  the  Legis-</span><span>  lative  Council,""  directs  that  the  clerk  shall</span><span>  ""fairly  transcribe""  the  list,  and  affix  it  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  walls  or  door  of  the  Court  House  for</span></p> <p><span>  seven  clear  days,  from  the  13th  to  the  20th</span><span>  April  —  a  time  amply  sufficient  to  allow  of</span><span>  all  errors,  both  of  intromission  and  omis-</span><span>  sion,  being  discovered.  Two  days  are</span><span>  allowed  to  voters,  whose  names  are  omit-</span><span>  ted,  or  who  object  to  the  claims  of  others</span></p> <p><span>  to  have  their  names  retained  on  the  elec-</span></p> <p><span>  toral  roll,  to  give  due  notice  to  the  Cleric</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  Bench.  Lists  of  all  claims  and</span></p> <p><span>  objections  are  then  prepared,  and  hung  up</span></p> <p><span>  on  the  outside  of  the  Court  House  from</span></p> <p><span>  the  22nd  April  to  the  1st  May.  The</span><span>  Police  Magistrate,  who  in  this  matter  oc-</span><span>  cupies  the  position  of  an  alderman  in  the</span><span>  municipal  towns  of  Sydney  and  Mel-</span><span>  bourne,  and  who  is  usually  nominated  as</span><span>  the  returning  officer  by  the  Governor,</span><span>  appoints  a  day,  between  the  1st  and  15th</span><span>  May,  for  the  holding  of  a  Court  of  Petty</span><span>  Sessions,  or  Registration  Court,  to  revise</span><span>  the  roll.  Ten  clear  days'  notice  having</span><span>  been  given,  the  Police  Magistrate,  assisted</span><span>  by  other  magistrates  as  assessors,  hears</span><span>  and  decides  upon  the  various  claims  and</span><span>  objections,  and  directs  the  list  of  voters  to</span></p> <p><span>  *  Since  the  above  was  in  type,  we  have  received</span><span>  the  last  Sydney  newspapers  by  the  Tamar.  We</span><span>  observe  that  Mr.  McLeay  met  with  a  serious  mis-</span><span>  hap  on  the  night  of  the  25th  ultimo.  Returning</span><span>  from  a  ball  given  by  Sir  Charles  and  Lady  Fitz-</span><span>  roy,  his  carriage  was  upset  by  a  blundering</span><span>  coachman,  and,  we  regret  to  state,  one  of  his  ribs</span><span>  and  his  collar  bone  were  fractured.  When  the</span><span>  Tamar  left  Sydney,  his  medical  attendants  had</span><span>  not  pronounced  him  out  of  danger.</span></p> <p><span>  be  amended  accordingly.  In  its  amended</span><span>  state,  it  is  forwarded  by  the  Clerk  of  the</span><span>  Bench,  on  or  before  the  1st  June,  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  returning  officer  ;  and.  forms  the  electoral</span><span>  roll  for  the  twelve  months  ensuing,</span></p> <p><span>  The  Act  provides  that  when  a  seat  be-</span><span>  comes  vacant,  a  writ  shall  be  issued  by</span><span>  the  Governor,  directed  to  the  returning</span><span>  officer,  fixing  the  day  of  nomination,  and</span><span>  in  the  event  of  the  election  being  con-</span></p> <p><span>  tested,  the  day  of  taking  the  poll.  The</span><span>  election  must  take  place  within  thirty</span><span>  days  of  the  date  of  the  writ,  which  must</span></p> <p><span>  be  returnable  from  Moreton  Bay,  not  later</span><span>  than  twenty-eight  days  afterward.  In  all</span><span>  the  other  districts,  except  Port  Phillip,</span><span>  writs  must  be  returned  within  fourteen</span><span>  days.</span></p> <p><span>  The  28th  clause  enacts,  ""That  on  the</span><span>  day  of  nomination,  which  shall  be  the  day</span><span>  of  election  named  in  the  writ,  the  return-</span><span>  ing  officer  shall  preside  at  a  meeting  to  be</span><span>  holden  at  noon,  and  shall  declare  the</span><span>  purpose  for  which  such  meeting  is  held  ;</span><span>  and  if  there  be  at  such  meeting  no  more</span><span>  candidates  proposed  than  the  number  of</span><span>  members  to  be  returned,  the  returning</span><span>  officer  shall  declare  such  candidate  or  can-</span><span>  didates  to  be  duly  elected,  and  make  his</span><span>  return  accordingly  ;  and  that  in  the  event</span><span>  of  there  being  more  candidates  than  the</span><span>  number  to  be  elected,  the  returning  officer</span><span>  shall  call  for  a  show  of  hands  separately  in</span><span>  favour  of  each  candidate,  and  after  such</span><span>  show  of  hands,  shall  declare  the  person  or</span><span>  persons  on  whom  the  election  has  fallen,</span><span>  and  shall  return  the  same  accordingly,</span><span>  unless  a  poll  be  demanded  by  one  of  the</span><span>  candidates,  or  by  not  less  than  six  electors</span><span>  on  his  behalf,  and  on  such  demand  being</span><span>  made  for  a  poll,  the  polling  shall  com-</span><span>  mence,  as  nearly  as  may  be,  at  nine</span><span>  o'clock  in  the  forenoon  of  the  day  ap-</span><span>  pointed  by  the  Governor  in  the  writ  for</span><span>  taking  the  poll,  and  no  poll  shall  be  kept</span><span>  open  later  than  four  of  the  clock  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  afternoon.""</span></p> <p><span>  The  32nd  clause  enacts,  ""That  as  soon</span><span>  as  may  be  practicable  after  the  election</span><span>  shall  have  been  held,  the  returning  officer</span><span>  shall  openly  declare  the  state  of  the  poll,</span></p> <p><span>  and  declare  the  name  or  names  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  person  or  persons  who  may  have  been  duly</span><span>  elected  ;  and  in  the  event  of  the  number</span><span>  of  votes  being  equal,  he  shall  by  his</span><span>  casting  vote  decide  the  election.""</span></p> <p><span>  Acts  deemed  to  constitute  bribery  are</span><span>  various.  The  giving  of  money,  or  any</span><span>  other  article  whatsoever,  cockades  inclu-</span><span>  ded,  the  holding  out  to  an  elector  any</span><span>  promise  or  expectation  of  profit,  or  making</span><span>  use  of  any  threat,  or  intimidating  him  in</span><span>  any  manner;  supplying  him  with  meat,</span><span>  drink,  lodging,  or  horse  or  carriage  hire,</span><span>  or  conveyance  of  any  kind  ;  paying  him</span><span>  a  sum  of  money  for  joining  in  a  proces-</span><span>  sion  ;  keeping  open,  or  allowing  to  be</span><span>  kept  open,  any  place  of  entertainment,</span><span>  whether  refreshment  be  distributed  or  not  ;</span><span>  the  giving  of  any  entertainment  at  any</span><span>  place  whatsoever  by  a  candidate,  to  any</span><span>  number  of  persons,  with  a  view  of  in-</span><span>  fluencing  their  votes  —  are  all  held  to  be</span><span>  acts  of  bribery,  and  the  candidate  commit-</span><span>  ting  any  one  of  them,  on  proof  thereof  be</span><span>  for  the  Court  for  the  trial  of  disputed  elec-</span><span>  tions,  is  disqualified  from  holding  a  seat</span><span>  in  the  Council  until  the  next  general</span></p> <p><span>  election.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  NEXT  GENERAL  ELECTION  !  Before</span><span>  that  takes  place  a  new  era  may  have  dawned</span><span>  upon  the  colony.  The  principle  of  taxa-</span><span>  tion  by  representation  —  our  inherent  pri-</span><span>  vilege,  of  which  we  have  now  little  more</span><span>  than  the  sound  and  shadow  —  may  be  in</span><span>  reality  conceded  to  us  ;  and,  the  franchise</span><span>  being  extended  to  the  great  bulk  of  the</span><span>  holders  of  colonial  property,  the  squatters</span><span>    —  our  Legislature  will  then  really  become</span><span>  a  Representative  Assembly.  The  present</span><span>  Council,  and  the  Act,  which  gave  it  birth,</span><span>  will  at  no  far  distant  date  expire  together.</span><span>  We  cannot  for  an  instant  suppose  that</span><span>  the  Act  which  succeeds  it  will  perpetuate</span><span>  its  blundering  injustice.  The  palpable</span><span>  absurdity  will  surely  not  much  longer</span><span>  exist  of  conceding  the  elective  franchise</span><span>  to  the  pettiest  householder  in  the  pettiest</span><span>  town,  and  denying  it  to  the  tenant  of  the</span><span>  Crown,  who  reckons  his  wealth  by  thou-</span><span>  sands.  Of  one  thing  we  may  be  assured  :</span><span>  until  justice  is  done  in  this  matter  to  the</span><span>  squatters,  the  people  of  Moreton  Bay  can</span><span>  never  hope  to  possess  a  requisite  degree</span><span>  of  influence  in  the  councils  of  the  colony.</span></p> ",Article,1846-09-12,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

"<p><span>  To  the  Editor  of  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  Sir,—In  your  paper  of  the  3rd  instant,  under  the</span><span>  head  of  ""  The  Constabulary,""  you  have  given</span><span>  insertion  to  a  misrepresentation  of  the  conduct  of</span><span>  Constable  McCrohon  on  his  arrival,  as  I  conceive</span><span>  you  acquired  your  information  from  a  resident  in</span><span>  this  town,  who,  under  the  pretence  of  giving  you</span><span>  a  facetious  morsel  for  your  readers,  gratified  the</span><span>  worst  of  feelings  of  himself  and  clique,  by  getting</span><span>  you  to  publish  a  series  of  falsehoods,  to  injure</span><span>  McCrohon  in  the  estimation  of  the  Magistrates  ;</span><span>  but  being  well  aware  of  your  anxiety  (as  a  caterer</span><span>  for  public  instruction  and  amusement)  to  re-</span><span>  fute  any  false  statements  which  may  be  inadvert-</span><span>  ently  inserted  in  your  journal,  I  beg  to  hand  you</span><span>  a  true  version  of  this  matter,  which  can,  if,  re-</span><span>  quired,  be  verified  by  affidavit.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  arrival  of  McCrohon  at  Ipswich,  a  man,</span><span>  named  Samson-who  has  a  wife  and  child-craved</span></p> <p><span>  permission  from  McCrohon  to  remain  a  day  or  two</span><span>  in  a  building  attached  to  the  Lockup-a  part  of</span><span>  which  Magrath  occupied-as  he  (Samson)  could</span><span>  not  get  a  place  to  put  his  family  in.  McCrohon</span><span>  replied  that  they  might  stop  for  a  day  or  two  if  his</span><span>  colleague  was  agreeable.  Magrath  subsequently</span><span>  assented  ;  but  mark  the  result  :  a  private  infor-</span><span>  mation  was  sent  to  the  Magistrates,  that  Magrath</span><span>  was  turned  out  by  McCrohon  to  make  room  for</span><span>  these  people  ;  but,  on  enquiry,  it  was  proved  to  be</span><span>  false,  as  Magrath  never  left  the  occupation  of  his</span><span>  usual  quarters  ;  but  the  truth  was  not  made  known</span><span>  in  time  to  prevent  McCrohon's  dismissal  from  the</span><span>  situation  of  District  Constable,—so  that  he  was</span><span>  punished  for  his  humanity  to  these  destitute  per-</span><span>  sons,  although  I  admit  he  had  no  right  to  give</span><span>  the  permission  to  occupy  the  place,  it  being  the</span><span>  property  of  the  Crown.</span></p> <p><span>  With  respect  to  the  visit  of  McCrohon  to  the</span><span>  Doctor's,  as  stated  in  your  article,  the  facts  were</span><span>  that  McCrohon  went  to  Doctor  Dorsay's,  to  en-</span><span>  quire  were  Furber  lived-as  I  am  informed--for</span><span>  the  purpose  of  hiring  his  team  to  draw  up  his</span><span>  (M'Crohon's)  goods;  and  this  visit  enabled  your</span><span>  corresponent  to  be  facetious  at  the  expense  of  his</span></p> <p><span>  veracity.

"<p><span>  To  the  Editor  of  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SIR,—I  observe  in  your  last  number  that  you  have</span><span>  favoured  your  readers  with  some  remarks  relative</span><span>  to  the  ferries,  and  the  appropriation  of  the  funds</span></p> <p><span>  derived  from  them.</span></p> <p><span>  I  quite  agree  with  you  that  it  is  high  time  we</span><span>  were  up  and  doing  in  this  matter.  The  wit  of</span><span>  man  could  devise  no  tax  more  opposed  to  common</span><span>  sense  and  sound  policy,  or  better  fitted  to  retard</span><span>  the  progress  of  a  young  and  struggling  com-</span><span>  munity,  than  the  abominable  ferry  imposition,  to</span><span>  which  you  have  recently  drawn  our  attention.  It</span><span>  is  at  once  a  tax  upon  communication  and  a  direct</span><span>  tax,  the  most  odious  and  unpopular  of  all  kinds  of</span><span>  taxation.  Its  effect  has  been,  as  every  one  amongst</span><span>  us  too  well  knows,  to  render  the  three  settlements</span><span>  of  Kangaroo  Point,  North  Brisbane,  and  South</span><span>  Brisbane,  as  isolated  and  as  separate  in  their  aims</span><span>  and  interests,  as  if  they  were  ten  miles  distant</span><span>  from  each  other,  instead  of  only  being  separated</span><span>  by  the  river  Brisbane.  Cease  when  it  may,  its</span><span>  fame  must  remain  as  long  as  the  history,  ""  the</span><span>  owre  true  tale,""  of  Sir  George  Gipps'  misrule  and</span><span>  political  treachery  endures.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  late  ruler,  while  visiting  this  part  of  the</span><span>  colony,  and  prior  to  the  sale  of  land  in  what  is  now</span><span>  South  Brisbane,  -  pledged  himself  to  the  inhabitants</span><span>  that  the  ferry  should  be  retained  in  the  hands  of</span><span>  the  Government  -  a  public  convenience  main-</span><span>  tained  at  the  public  expense.  No  sooner,  however,</span><span>  did  the  land-bubble  burst  -  the  goose  die  ""  which</span><span>  laid  the  golden  eggs""  -  no  sooner  were  a  number</span><span>  of  allotments  sold  on  the  south  bank  of  the  river,</span><span>  than  the  Government  put  up  the  ferry  to  auction</span><span>  to  the  highest  bidder  ;  and  a  tax  was  imposed  of</span><span>  2d.  on  foot  passengers,  6d.  on  horses,  and  5s.  a</span><span>  ton  on  goods.</span></p> <p><span>  What  will  strangers  at  a  distance  say  when  they</span><span>  learn  that  a  resident  here,  walking  from  one  end</span><span>  of  the  town  to  the  other  --  from  South  Brisbane  to</span><span>  Kangaroo  Point  -  and  back  again,  must  pay  a  toll</span><span>  of  EIGHTPENCE  ;  if  on  horseback,  TWO  SHILLINGS</span><span>  AND  EIGHTPENCE  ;  and  for  a  ton  of  goods,  if</span><span>  taken  the  same  way,  ONE  POUND  ?</span></p> <p><span>  Is  not  this  monstrous  ?  Can  anything  be  more</span><span>  unjust  ?  Could  anything  be  devised  more  suicidal</span><span>  of  the  very  object  at  which  it  aims  -  the  creation  of</span></p> <p><span>  revenue  ?</span></p> <p><span>  What  is  the  conduct  of  Government  ?  By  sell-</span><span>  ing  land  on  both  sides  of  the  river,  it  splits  the</span><span>  town  up  into  sections,  and  creates  natural  obsta-</span><span>  cles,  and  then  -  yes,  then  ;  will  it  be  credited  ?  -</span><span>  taxes  us  for  its  own  stupid  and  miserable  blunder-</span><span>  ing.  This  is  truly  a  notable  way  of  raising  a</span><span>  revenue,  and  right  worthy  of  the  policy  of  the</span><span>  man  with  whom  it  originated.</span></p> <p><span>  But  what  is  the  amount  that  accrues  to  the</span><span>  revenue  from  this  source?  A  paltry  £160  or</span><span>  £170  a  year.  To  get  at  this,  the  Government</span><span>  coolly  consents  to  our  being  in  reality  taxed  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  tune  of  about  £1000  !</span></p> <p><span>  The  whole  matter,  absurd  though  it  be,  is  too</span><span>  serious  to  be  treated  with  ridicule.  And  we  have</span></p> <p><span>  borne  the  infliction  so  long,  (with  murmuring,  it  is</span><span>  true),  that  invective  would  now  be  out  of  place.</span><span>  The  present  Government,  however,  will  surely</span><span>  never  sanction  the  perpetuation  of  any  such  in-</span><span>  justice,  if  it  is  rightly  represented  to  them.  But</span><span>  if  we  coolly  sit  down,  and  pay  so  iniquitous  a  tax</span><span>  without  marking  our  disapprobation  of  it,  save  by</span><span>  an  occasional  John  Bullish  grumble,  then  of  course</span></p> <p><span>  we  have  none  save  ourselves  to  blame.  Our  late</span></p> <p><span>  Governor  took  advantage  of  our  weakness  and</span><span>  helplessness  ;  he  acted  towards  us  as,  I  trust,  no</span><span>  Governor  will  ever  dare  to  do  again.

He  was  to  get  several  head  of  fat  cattle</span><span>  from  Laidley,  which  had  been  presented  to  him</span><span>  by  J.  P.  Robinson,  Esq.  When  the  Doctor  left</span><span>  the  Downs,  it  was  not  his  intention  to  visit  Bris-</span><span>  bane.  The  stock  that  he  had  brought  overland</span><span>  consisted  of  a  large  flock  of  goats  (380,  I  believe,),</span><span>  and  sixteen  mules,  which  were  depasturing  on  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Bracker's  station  until  the  Doctor's  return  ;  when</span><span>  that  took  place,  the  party  intended  to  proceed  to</span><span>  Jimba,  their  final  starting  place.  The  Messrs.</span><span>  Leslie  and  Messrs.

"<p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  JUNE  20,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  COURIER  has  been  established  in</span><span>  compliance  with  the  almost  unanimous</span><span>  wish  of  every  resident,  of  character,  pro-</span><span>  perty,  and  intelligence,  in  this  extensive</span><span>  district.  The  unfounded  impressions  that</span><span>  prevail  elsewhere  respecting  the  climate,</span><span>  capabilities,  and  resources,  of  this  portion</span><span>  of  the  colony,  and  the  absence  of  those</span><span>  beneficial  moral  influences  which  have</span></p> <p><span>  their  origin  in  the  Press,  have  long  ren-</span><span>  dered  a  local  journal  necessary.  The</span><span>  commercial  importance  of  the  com-</span><span>  munity,  indeed,  demands  its  introduc-</span><span>  tion.  Churches,  schools,  stores,  shops,</span><span>  inns,  dwelling-houses,  and  erections</span><span>  for  various  purposes,  have  rapidly</span><span>  risen  ;  settlements  have  become  villages  ;</span><span>  villages,  towns.  Our  staple  articles  of</span><span>  export,  wool  and  tallow,  have  strikingly</span><span>  increased  ;  and  with  their  increase,  fresh</span><span>  incitement  has  been  afforded  to  industry</span><span>  and  enterprize.  And  as  the  position  of</span><span>  the  grazing  and  trading  classes,  who  form</span><span>  the  bulk  of  our  infant  society,  has  im-</span><span>  proved,  and  population  has  augmented,</span><span>  prosperity  has  educed  requirements  that</span><span>  can  only  appertain  to  an  advanced  state</span><span>  of  society.  Perhaps  none  is  so  urgent  as</span><span>  that  which  we  aim  to  supply.</span></p> <p><span>  We  commence  our  labours  at  a  crisis</span><span>  highly  interesting  and  important.  Our</span><span>  home  and  colonial  dynasties  are  happily</span><span>  changed.  The  weight  of  tyranny,  mis-</span><span>  representation,  and  neglect,  under  which</span><span>  the  colonists  have  long,  bitterly,  and  un-</span><span>  ceasingly  complained,  is  about  to  be  re-</span><span>  moved.  Instead  of  men,  whose  tenures</span><span>  of  office  were  marked  by  carelessness  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  welfare  of  those  entrusted  to  their</span></p> <p><span>  control,  strong  prejudices  in  favour  of</span><span>  their  own  too  often  hastily-formed</span><span>  opinions,  excessive  obstinacy  in  adhering</span><span>  to  them  when  once  expressed,  and  queru-</span><span>  lous  impatience  of  their  contradiction,</span><span>  rendering  their  admitted  great  talents</span></p> <p><span>  worse  than  negative  in  their  influence  on</span><span>  our  destinies,  Ministers  have  wisely</span><span>  substituted  a  Secretary  of  State,  and  a</span><span>  Governor,  whose  past  careers  justly  en-</span><span>  title  them  to  our  confidence  and  respect.</span></p> <p><span>  In  Mr.  Gladstone  we  recognise  one  who,</span><span>  in  true  liberality  of  feeling,  in  just  and</span><span>  comprehensive  views  of  political  economy,</span><span>  in  thorough  acquaintance  with  the  whole</span><span>  system  of  our  commercial  and  colonial</span><span>  policy,  and  in  freedom,  at  least  so  far  as</span><span>  known  to  the  public,  from  all  pre-</span><span>  conceived  and  pet  schemes,  promises  to</span><span>  administer  the  affairs  of  the  Colonial</span><span>  Office  in  a  widely  different  manner  from</span><span>  that  in  which  they  have  been  hitherto</span><span>  conducted.  There  are  few  statesmen  of</span><span>  the  present  day  who  have  risen  so  rapidly</span><span>  in  public  estimation,  and  few  who  give</span><span>  fairer  promise  of  rising  still  higher.  Sir</span><span>  Charles  Fitzroy  has  also  been  tried  and</span><span>  proved,  and  on  his  coadjutancy,  we  pre-</span><span>  dict,  our  Colonial  Minister  may  safely</span><span>  depend  in  carrying  out  whatever  measures</span><span>  of  conciliation  and  concession  he  may</span><span>  deem  necessary  to  restore  public  confi-</span><span>  dence,  and  destroy  a  growing  spirit  of  dis-</span><span>  affection.  Such  measures  are  indeed</span><span>  urgently  needed.  The  great  stay  of  our</span><span>  social  fabric,  the  Pastoral  interest,  is</span><span>  fluctuating  and  unsettled:  the  all-impor-</span><span>  tant  question  of  Colonial  policy,  the</span><span>  tenure  of  Waste  Lands,  is  not  yet  deter-</span><span>  mined;  and  all  classes  are  anxiously</span><span>  awaiting  those  farther  modifications  of</span><span>  Mr.  Hope's  Bill,  necessary  to  enable  it  to</span></p> <p><span>  realise  the  views  and  intentions  of  its</span><span>  framer.  On  the  other  hand,  the  odious</span><span>  pound-an-acre  minimum  is  not  yet  blotted</span><span>  from  the  Statute  Book,  nor  its  place  sup-</span><span>  plied  by  a  law  based  upon  the  common-</span><span>  sense  principle  that  land  is  not  worth</span><span>  more  than  it  is  capable,  in  ordinary</span><span>  seasons,  of  returning,  together  with  a  fair</span><span>  rate  of  profit,  to  the  buyer.  In  addition,</span><span>  therefore,  to  ""  facts  based  on  figures,""</span><span>  strong,  energetic,  and  unceasing  demon-</span><span>  strations,  are  yet  necessary  on  the  part  of</span><span>  the  colonists,  to  induce  Her  Majesty's  ad-</span><span>  visers  to  recognise  the  simple  axiom,  that</span><span>  the  progressive  prosperity  of  the  colony,</span><span>  and  its  consequent  importance  to  the</span><span>  British  empire,  do  not  depend  upon  the</span><span>  mere  sums  directly  realised  by  selling  its</span><span>  public  lands,  but  mainly  on  the  develope-</span><span>  ment  of  the  lands'  capabilities  :  and  that</span><span>  our  true  interests  are  conserved,  only  so</span><span>  far  as  this  principle  is  received.  A  high</span><span>  or  a  low  nominal  price  can  never  affect  the</span><span>  real  value  of  land.  That  value  is  deter-</span></p> <p><span>  mined  solely  by  the  inducements  it  pre-</span><span>  sents  to  the  capitalist.  To  place  a  reserve</span><span>  of  twenty  shillings  upon  land,  in  many</span><span>  places  not  worth  one,  is  therefore  opposed</span><span>  to  the  simplest  economical  principles,  an-</span><span>  nihilates  the  land  fund,  and  is  a  stretch  of</span><span>  power  as  unwise  as  it  is  arbitrary  and</span><span>  unjust.</span></p> <p><span>  The  land  fund,  too,  is  still  withheld</span><span>  from  the  control  of  the  people's  repre-</span></p> <p><span>  sentatives.  We  have  the  mortification  of</span></p> <p><span>  seeing  this  highly  important  branch  of</span><span>  revenue  squandered  by  a  herd  of  over-paid</span><span>  official  drones,  in  a  manner  that  too</span><span>  plainly  bespeaks  them  ignorant  of  our</span><span>  wants,  and  careless  of  our  welfare.</span></p> <p><span>  View  it  in  what  aspect  we  may,  the</span><span>  great  vexata  quœstio  of  Public  Lands  is</span><span>  disfigured  by  unconstitutional  abuse;  and</span><span>  it  behoves  every  well-wisher  of  the  colony</span><span>  to  agitate  unceasingly  until  the  whole</span><span>  system  is  swept  away  to  make  room  for  a</span></p> <p><span>  better.</span></p> <p><span>  Adequate  representation—he  conces-</span></p> <p><span>  sion  of  the  elective  franchise  to  owners  of</span><span>  live  stock,  as  well  as  to  those  whose  capital</span><span>  is  vested  in  the  soil,—and  correlative  to</span><span>  this,  the  extension  of  the  representative</span><span>  element  in  our  Legislature,  are  subjects  of</span><span>  the  last  importance.  The  powers  of  the</span><span>  Legislature  require  to  be  more  distinctly</span><span>  defined:  of  this  our  readers  will  find  ample</span><span>  proof  in  the  debates  of  last  session  :  a</span><span>  boundary  must  be  fixed,  which  even  the</span><span>  Governor  of  the  colony  will  not  dare  to</span><span>  pass  without  the  consent  of  the  people.</span></p> <p><span>  District  Councils  (the  frozen  vipers,</span></p> <p><span>  over  whose  monstrous  birth  their  anxious</span></p> <p><span>  author  watched,  only  to  see  them  trodden</span><span>  under  foot  by  those  in  whose  bosoms  he</span><span>  sought  to  thrust  them,  or,  if  received,  with</span><span>  fangs  extracted,  powerless  to  wound,  and</span><span>  objects  of  derisive  pity)  are  unknown</span><span>  amongst  us.  The  growing  importance,</span><span>  however  of  our  chief  town,  and  the</span><span>  district  contiguous,  renders  us,  in  common</span><span>  with  the  colonists  at  large,  anxious  to</span><span>  witness  either  their  modification  or  their</span><span>  total  repeal.</span></p> <p><span>  Turning  from  political,  to  moral  and</span><span>  social  topics,  we  solicit  attention  to  the</span><span>  vital  necessity  of  a  comprehensive  scheme</span><span>  of  National  Education.  The  future  cha-</span></p> <p><span>  racter,  as  well  as  the  future  prosperity  of</span><span>  the  colony,  depend  upon  it.  The  recent</span><span>  Census  informs  us  that  a  numerous  native</span></p> <p><span>  race  is  fast  springing  up  throughout  the</span></p> <p><span>  colony,  thousands  of  whom  are  approach-</span><span>  ing  to  manhood  without  even  the  elements</span><span>  of  education.  It  is  appalling  to  think</span><span>  that  in  a  few  years,  the  great  bulk  of  the</span><span>  population  of  our  rural  districts  may  be</span><span>  composed  of  persons,  whose  ignorance  will</span><span>  unfit  them  for  anything  beyond  bare</span></p> <p><span>  manual  labour,  and  render  them  adepts</span><span>  only  in  vice  and  immorality.  A  speedy</span></p> <p><span>  and  effectual  remedy  for  this  lamentable</span><span>  state  of  things  must  be  provided  by  our</span><span>  Government;  if  they  wish  the  land  to  be</span><span>  filled  with  a  virtuous  and  intelligent  po-</span><span>  pulation.  And  the  only  remedy,  we  believe,</span><span>  which  will  effectually  meet  the</span><span>  peculiar  circumstances  of  the  colony,  is  a</span><span>  GENERAL  SYSTEM  OF  EDUCATION—a  system</span><span>  which  will  aim  not  at  the  advancement  of</span><span>  sectarian  interests,  but  at  the  inculcation</span><span>  of  sound  morality  and  virtuous  habits.  A</span><span>  system  of  this  kind,  we  feel  sure,  would</span><span>  command  the  approbation  and  support  of</span><span>  all  the  liberal  and  enlightened  portion  of</span><span>  the  community.  To  obtain  it,  and  when</span><span>  obtained,  to  aid  in  carrying  it  into  active</span><span>  and  extensive  operation,  we  intend  to  give</span><span>  our  cordial  and  earnest  endeavours.</span></p> <p><span>  A  regular  and  sufficient  supply  of</span><span>  labour  stands  foremost  among  the  topics</span><span>  to  which  the  limits  of  our  address  preclude</span><span>  us  from  adverting.  In  further  elucidation</span><span>  of  our  views  and  principles,  we  assure  our</span><span>  readers  that  our  conduct  will  be  ever  in-</span></p> <p><span>  fluenced  by  a  due  regard  of  what  we  may</span><span>  conscientiously  deem  the  true  interests  of</span><span>  our  constituents  and  of  the  colony.  We</span><span>  eschew  sectarian  controversy,  as  unsuited</span><span>  to  the  character  and  objects  of  a  news-</span><span>  paper.  Claiming  for  ourselves  the  right</span><span>  of  private  judgment,  we  willingly  concede</span><span>  a  similar  right  to  every  man.  He,  in-</span><span>  deed,  who  by  means  of  the  Press  seeks  to</span><span>  foster  bigotry  and  promote  the  strife  of</span><span>  sects,  is  society's  worst  enemy—its  most</span><span>  dangerous  foe.</span></p> <p><span>  The  exposure  of  private  turpitude  may</span><span>  sometimes  preserve  public  integrity  intact.</span><span>  In  such  a  case  we  shall  not  be  slow  to</span><span>  speak  out.  Private  acts,  however,  are</span><span>  alone  fit  subjects  for  newspaper  comment</span><span>  when  they  are  inimical  to  the  happiness</span><span>  and  well-being  of  society.</span></p> <p><span>  As  a  local  journal,  it  will  be  our  great</span><span>  object  to  make  known  the  wants  of  the</span><span>  community;  to  point  out  the  most  eligi-</span><span>  ble  field  presented  to  capital  and  enter-</span><span>  prise;  to  rouse  the  apathetic,  to  inform</span><span>  the  ignorant,  to  infuse  animation  into</span><span>  struggles  for  political  and  social  rights  ;  to</span><span>  unite  the  whole  moral  feeling  and  intel-</span><span>  ligence  of  the  sphere  in  which  we  move  ;</span><span>  to  transmit  truthful  representations  of  the</span><span>  state  of  this  unrivalled  portion  of  the</span><span>  colony  to  other  and  distant  parts  of  the</span><span>  globe;  to  encourage  every  enterprise  that</span><span>  will  tend  to  benefit  it,  and  in  general  to</span><span>  advance  its  interests,  and  promote  its</span><span>  prosperity.</span></p> <p><span>  In  addition  to  domestic  news  and  ad-</span><span>  vertisements,  the  COURIER  will  contain  an</span><span>  interesting  epitome  of  Home,  Colonial,</span><span>  and  Foreign  intelligence,  as  well  as  judi-</span><span>  cious  notices  of  all  topics  of  interest  in</span><span>  science  and  literature.  These,  together</span><span>  with  the  promised  contributions  of  several</span><span>  gentlemen  of  education  and  talent,  whom</span><span>  we  expect  to  number  among  our  corres-</span></p> <p><span>  pondents,  will,  we  hope,  render  this</span><span>  journal  worthy  of  public  support.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  RACES.</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><span>  THE  Annual  Meeting  of  the  Moreton</span><span>  Bay  Racing  Club,  took  place  at  the  Race</span><span>  Course,  New  Farm,  on  Tuesday  and  two</span><span>  following  days  in  the  past  week.  The</span><span>  attendance  on  the  course  was  not  only</span><span>  numerous  but  boasting  more  than  an</span><span>  average  of  respectability.  The  sun  shone</span><span>  brightly,  and,  judging  from  the  happy</span><span>  faces  of  the  holiday  folks,  it  was  evident</span><span>  that  all  came  there  to  enjoy  themselves,</span><span>  and  to  take  part  in  the  amusements.  The</span><span>  greater  part  of  the  assembled  throng  con-</span><span>  sisted  of  pedestrians,  who  like  ourselves,</span><span>  chose  to  make  use  of  that  far-famed</span><span>  animal  known  as  Shanks’  mare  for  the</span><span>  occasion.  There  was  a  goodly  number  of</span><span>  the  fair  sex  dressed  out  in  holiday  attire,</span><span>  which  with  the  bright  costumes  of  the</span><span>  gentleman-jockeys,  gave  a  most  animated</span><span>  appearance  to  the  scene.  It  only  wanted</span><span>  a  band  of  music  to  add  to  the  harmony</span><span>  of  the  proceedings,  and  make  the  mirth</span><span>  and  excitement  complete.  Some  of  the</span><span>  booths  were  gaily  decorated  with  flags;</span><span>  others  with  drapery;  while  the  less  am-</span><span>  bitious  were  ornamented  with  the  pro-</span><span>  ductions  of  nature,  which  gave  them  a</span><span>  rustic  appearance.  The  spread  at  the  se-</span><span>  veral  tables  was  very  substantial,  and</span><span>  ample  justice  was  done  to  the  many  good</span><span>  things  provided  for  the  visitors.  Our</span><span>  friend  “David”  at  the  Victoria,  as  usual,</span></p> <p><span>  got  a  large  share  of  patronage.  Our</span><span>  limited  space  will  not  permit  us  to  enter</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  more  at  length  into  small  matters;  so</span><span>  we  shall  proceed  to  state  the  results  of</span><span>  the  different  races,  premising,  however,</span><span>  that  we  do  not  constitute  ourselves  in-</span><span>  fallible  judges  of  the  merits  of  any  par-</span></p> <p><span>  ticular  horse.</span></p> <p><span>  The  BRISBANE  TOWN  PLATE,  for  all  horses;</span><span>  weight  for  age;  heats  once  round  and  a  distance.</span></p> <p><span>  Toby  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

(Bigge)  2  0</span></p> <p><span>  The  horses  were  led  to  the  ground  in  good  racing</span><span>  trim,  although  Splinter  was,  if  anything,  rather</span><span>  too  finely  drawn  for  carrying  heavy  weight.  At</span><span>  the  first  burst  Splinter  took  the  lead,  and  succeeded</span><span>  in  getting  an  inside  berth;  a  beautiful  race  then</span><span>  took  place  for  about  half  a  mile,  when  Toby  headed</span><span>  him.  At  the  distance  post,  Toby  was  about  a</span><span>  length  ahead  of  his  competitor,  and  maintained</span><span>  his  advantage  to  the  end  of  the  race,  beating</span><span>  Splinter  by  about  two  lengths.  A  charge  of  foul</span><span>  riding  was  brought  against  the  rider  of  Toby,</span><span>  and  the  Stewards  having  heard  evidence,  pro  and</span><span>  con,  decided  that  it  had  been  substantiated.  Toby</span><span>  was  accordingly  adjudged  to  be  distanced,  and</span><span>  Mr.  Bigge  became  entitled  to  the  stakes.  The</span><span>  time  occupied  in  going  over  the  ground  was  one</span><span>  minute  and  thirty-four  seconds.</span></p> <p><span>  The  MAIDEN  PLATE,  for  all  horses  under  five</span></p> <p><span>  years  that  never  won  public  money;  weights  for</span><span>  age;  heats  once  round.</span></p> <p><span>  Princess  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

(Whitting)  2  2</span></p> <p><span>  Princess  was  brought  out  in  excellent  condition,</span><span>  and  excited  universal  admiration.  At  the  start</span><span>  the  filly  took  the  lead,  followed  by  Tamerlane,  who</span><span>  appeared  to  be  held  hard  by  his  rider.  Half  way</span><span>  round  the  course,  Princess  was  considerably  ahead,</span><span>  and  evidently  had  it  all  her  own  way,  for  she  won</span><span>  the  first  heat  easily.  In  the  second  heat  Princess</span><span>  maintained  her  maiden  reputation,  and  came  in  a</span><span>  winner  by  about  two  lengths.</span></p> <p><span>  The  WELTER  STAKES,  for  all  horses  carrying</span><span>  12  stone;  three  times  round  the  course.</span></p> <p><span>  Harkaway  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

Dermott</span></p> <p><span>  then  passed  Job  ;  and  at  the  distance  post  the</span><span>  three  were  in  a  line  about  four  lengths  from  each</span><span>  other,  Harkaway  still  leading.  In  the  second</span><span>  round  bets  were  freely  offered  in  favour  of  Hark-</span><span>  away,  and  eventually  he  came  in  an  easy  winner.</span><span>  This  race  excited  a  good  deal  of  interest.</span></p> <p><span>  The  day’s  sport  closed  with  a  Hack  Race,  which</span><span>  was  won  by  Dairyman,  beating  five  others.</span></p> <p><span>  SECOND  DAY.</span></p> <p><span>  HURDLE  RACK,  for  all  horses;  weight  for  age:</span><span>  twice  round,  over  six  leaps,  3  feet  9  inches  high.</span></p> <p><span>  Dermott  McFig  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

Harkaway  having  been</span><span>  got  over,  took  the  second  leap,  and  made  up  for</span><span>  lost  time.  Dermott  then  cleared  the  third  leap;</span><span>  but  Harkaway  again  refused,  and  threw  his  rider</span><span>  with  fearful  force  against  the  hurdles.  This  mis-</span><span>  hap  placed  him  hors  de  combat,  and  Dermott</span><span>  came  in  the  winner.  Some  time  elapsed  before</span><span>  Artful  Dodger  and  Harkaway  could  be  remounted  ;</span><span>  and  the  former  came  in  second,  having  taken  his</span><span>  other  leaps  without  difficulty.</span></p> <p><span>  HACK  HURDLE  RACE,  for  untrained  hacks;</span><span>  catch  weights,  post  entrance,  over  three  leaps  3</span><span>  feet  3  inches  high.</span></p> <p><span>  Dairyman  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

(Furber)  3</span></p> <p><span>  Dairyman  took  all  his  leaps  in  his  usual  gallant</span><span>  style,  and  came  in  an  easy  winner.  The  rider  of</span><span>  Strike-a-light  got  a  fearful  spill  at  the  first  leap,</span><span>  and  Cantab,  in  baulking  at  the  third  leap,  turned  a</span><span>  complete  sommerset  over  the  ropes,  fortunately</span><span>  without  any  serious  injury  to  poor  Sandy,  who</span><span>  immediately  remounted,  and  cleared  it  beautifully</span><span>  amidst  the  plaudits  of  the  company.  A  subscrip-</span><span>  tion  was  shortly  afterwards  entered  into  by  the</span><span>  gentlemen  present,  and  the  amount  was  handed</span><span>  over  to  him,  by  way  of  encouragement,  for  his</span><span>  spirited  conduct.</span></p> <p><span>  A  most  amusing  hack  hurdle  race  then  took</span><span>  place  between  Parnassus  and  Dandy,  the  former</span><span>  ridden  by  Mr.  Hawkins,  and  the  latter  by  Mr.</span><span>  Campbell.  At  the  second  leap,  Dandy  refused</span><span>  and  threw  his  rider.  Mr.  Hawkins  on  witnessing</span><span>  this  untoward  event,  pulled  up  his  horse,  and</span><span>  coolly  waited  until  his  friend  Colin  had  picked</span><span>  himself  up  and  remounted.  Dandy  then  took  the</span><span>  second  leap,  followed  by  Parnassus,  to  the  third</span><span>  fence,  when  both  horses  refused.  After  several</span><span>  attempts  Dandy  was  go  over,  and  Parnassus  im-</span><span>  mediately  followed,  too  late,  however,  to  win  the</span><span>  race,  the  persuaders  having  been  applied  by</span><span>  Dandy’s  rider  with  admirable  effect.</span></p> <p><span>  A  Hurry  Skurry  Stakes  was  then  run  for,  when</span><span>  Peter  Jackson  was  the  successful  competitor.</span></p> <p><span>  THIRD  DAY.</span></p> <p><span>  The  PUBLICANS’  PURSE,  for  all  horses;  weights</span><span>  for  age;  heats  twice  round.  Three  horses  only</span><span>  were  entered  for  this  race,  and,  with  shame  be  it</span><span>  recorded,  only  one  horse  started.  It  really  reflects</span><span>  anything  but  credit  upon  our  sportsmen  to  allow</span></p> <p><span>  the  stake  to  be  won  without  a  contest.</span></p> <p><span>  The  LADIES’  PURSE,  for  all  horses;  weights</span><span>  for  age  ;  heats  once  round.</span></p> <p><span>  Baronet  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .(Furber.)  1  1</span><span>  Princess  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  (Burgoyne)  2  2</span><span>  This  race  excited  considerable  interest.  Baronet</span></p> <p></p> <p><span>  took  the  lead  and  won  both  heats  easily.  In  the</span><span>  first  round  it  soon  became  evident  that  Baronet</span><span>  had  more  speed  and  stamina  than  the  filly.  The</span><span>  Princess  was  over-weighted  for  this  match,  and</span><span>  although  the  racing  was  not  first  rate,  the  judges</span><span>  prognosticated  highly  of  the  future  performances</span><span>  of  this  filly.  We  may  add  that  the  horses  were  well</span><span>  ridden.  The  decision  as  to  the  right  of  the  stakes</span><span>  has  been  deferred,  as  it  was  alleged  that  Baronet’s</span><span>  age  was  not  correctly  entered.</span></p> <p><span>  The  TALLY-HO  STAKES,  for  all  horses  carrying</span><span>  eleven  stone  ;  three  times  round  the  course,</span></p> <p><span>  Harkaway  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .(Berkeley)  1</span></p> <p><span>  Splinter  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  (Bigge)  2</span></p> <p><span>  This  was  decidedly  the  best  contested  race  of  the</span><span>  day,  and  excited  great  interest  among  the  “turf-</span><span>  ites,”  Harkaway  reflected  much  credit  on  his</span><span>  trainer,  and  his  performances  have  constituted</span><span>  him  a  leading  favourite—indeed  he  will  give  any</span><span>  horse  in  the  two  districts  “  his  work,  to  do.”  Du-</span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  ring  the  race  Splinter  disputed  every  inch  of</span><span>  ground  with  him,  but  he  came  in  a  winner  by</span><span>  about  two  lengths.

The</span><span>  running  was  between  Job  and  Artful  ;  it  was</span><span>  neck  and  neck  for  some  time,  but  on  nearing  the</span><span>  distance  post  Job  forged  ahead,  and  finally  won</span><span>  the  race  by  about  a  length,  to  the  astonishment</span><span>  of  some  of  the  wisest  of  the  knowing  ones,  who</span><span>  expected  Tamerlane  would  have  won.</span></p> <p><span>  The  HACK  STAKES,  for  untrained  hacks  ;  catch</span><span>  weights  ;  post  entrances.  Six  horses  started.</span></p> <p><span>  There  was  a  false  start  at  the  commencement  of</span><span>  this  race,  in  consequence  of  some  unauthorized</span><span>  officious  individual  giving  the  word  ""  off.""  Three</span><span>  horses  that  were  in  advancement  round  the  course</span><span>  their  riders  probably  not  being  aware  of  what</span><span>  had  occurred  ;  two  of  them  did  not  venture  to</span></p> <p><span>  start  again.  The  stakes  were  won  by  Dairyman,</span><span>  ridden  by  Mr.  Burgoyne.</span></p> <p><span>  The  HURRY  SKURRY  STAKES  were  won  by  Mr.</span><span>  Andrew's  chesnut  horse,  beating  five  others,</span></p> <p><span>  No  serious  accidents  occurred  to  mar</span></p> <p><span>  the  pleasures  of  the  sports,  and  every</span><span>  thing  passed  off  exceedingly  well.  The</span><span>  Stewards,  as  well  as  the  Clerk  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Course,  gave  general  satisfaction.

The  time,  however,  has  ar-</span><span>  rived  when  declamation  should  give  way  to  sober,</span><span>  temperate  discussion.

He  knew  not  the  might</span><span>  that  slumbered  within  them  ;  nor  did  he  contem-</span><span>  plate  the  possibility  of  rousing  them  to  united,</span><span>  indignant  resistance.  That  there  was  a  limit,</span><span>  however,  to  their  forbearance,  which  even  he</span><span>  could  not  pass  in  safety,  he  has,  unfortunately</span><span>  for  himself  and  for  the  colony,  long  since  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  covered.</span></p> <p><span>  To  the  contemplative,  the  striking  change  in</span><span>  Sir  George's  political  creed,  affords  matter  for  re-</span><span>  flection.

The  department  will</span><span>  be  completed  by  the  addition  of  a  tide-waiter  and</span><span>  coxswain,  and  a  boat's  crew  of  four  men.</span></p> <p><span>  The  establishment  of  a  Customs  department  at</span><span>  Brisbane  will  prove  highly  beneficial  to  our  mer-</span><span>  cantile  friends.

It  is,  however,  the  wish  of  the  au-</span><span>  thorities  to  be  as  lenient  as  possible  in  such  a</span><span>  case  ;  the  Inspector  of  Colonial  Customs  having,</span></p> <p><span>  some  time  since,  strongly  urged  upon  the  Home</span><span>  Government  the  necessity  of  declaring  Moreton</span><span>  Bay  a  FREE  WAREHOUSING  PORT.  This,  perhaps</span><span>  our  readers  are  aware,  requires  the  sanction  of</span><span>  the  Lords  of  the  Treasury,  and  an  order  signed</span><span>  by  the  Queen  in  Council.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Duncan  has  entered  upon  the  duties  of  his</span><span>  office.  The  business  of  the  Customs,  at  present,</span><span>  is  transacted  at  his  temporary  residence  in  Queen</span><span>  street,  North  Brisbane.  It  will,  however,  be</span><span>  shortly  removed  to  the  building  now  occupied  as</span><span>  the  Commissariat  store.

When  these  are  completed,  it  is  sup-</span><span>  posed  that  the  amount  of  contributions  will  not</span><span>  fall  short  of  fifteen  hundred  pounds.  In  addition</span><span>  to  this,  Mr.  Cowper,  the  member  for  Cumberland,</span><span>  was  to  move  in  the  Legislative  Council  on  the  9th</span><span>  inst.,  that  an  address  be  presented  to  the  Governor</span><span>  stating  the  Council's  high  sense  of  the  Doctor's</span><span>  ability,  perseverance,  and  intrepidity,  and  inti-</span><span>  mating  its  willingness  to  vote  £1,000  as  a</span><span>  reward  for  the  exertions  of  him  and  his  party  in</span><span>  the  cause  of  science,  and  for  the  important  services</span><span>  rendered  by  them  to  the  colony.  The  motion</span><span>  will  of  course  be  carried  without  division.  A  pe-</span><span>  tition  to  His  Excellency,  expressive  of  the  same</span><span>  sentiments,  was  also  in  course  of  signature  in</span><span>  Sydney.</span></p> <p><span>  The  sum  which  will  be  thus  shortly  placed  at</span><span>  Leichhardt's  disposal  is  to  be  appropriated  to  a</span><span>  purpose  truly  noble—a  purpose  worthy  of  the</span><span>  man  whose  high  courage,  elevation  of  soul,  and</span><span>  enthusiasm  in  the  cause  of  science,  led  him  to</span><span>  undertake  a  task  pronounced  to  be  hopeless  by</span><span>  the  most  sanguine  and  enterprising  among  an</span><span>  enterprising  people.  If  this,  his  recent  great</span><span>  achievement,  has  rendered  his  heroic  daring  and</span><span>  high  emprise  the  subject  of  the  utmost  wonder</span><span>  and  admiration  in  the  minds  of  us  all,  ranking</span><span>  him  in  the  first  rank  of  travellers,  his  name</span><span>  proudly  conspicuous  amidst  the  names  already</span><span>  inscribed  on  the  deathless  roll  of  fame,  what  will</span><span>  attend  the  successful  issue  of  his  projected  un-</span><span>  dertaking,  with  which  in  magnitude  of  conception</span><span>  and  difficulties  to  be  overcome  the  journey  to  Port</span><span>  Essington  is  not  to  be  compared  !  His  hands,</span><span>  strengthened  by  the  liberality  of  the  colonists,</span><span>  the  Doctor  purposes  to  start  from  Moreton</span><span>  Bay,  and  proceeding  to  the  northward,  trace</span></p> <p><span>  the  rivers  which  flow  into  the  Gulf  of  Car-</span></p> <p><span>  pentaria  to  their  sources  ;  then,  taking  a</span><span>  north-westerly  course,  traverse  the  borders</span><span>  of  the  terra  incognita,  supposed  by  Eyre</span><span>  to  be  a  vast  desert,  by  others  an  inland  sea  ;  a</span><span>  problem,  which,  if  Sir  Thomas  Mitchell  be  un-</span><span>  successful,  will  remain  for  him  to  solve.  [The</span><span>  result  of  Sturt's  expedition,  the  character  of  the</span><span>  country  so  far  as  known,  the  fact  that  all  portions</span><span>  of  South  Australia  and  of  New  South  Wales,</span><span>  unprotected  by  coast  ranges,  are  subject  to  pe-</span><span>  riodical  hot  winds,  either  from  the  N.  or  N.  W.,</span><span>  without  any  other  assignable  cause  than  currents</span><span>  of  air  passing  over  vast  tracts  of  heated  country,</span><span>  incline  us  to  the  former  supposition.]  After  making</span><span>  the  north-west  coast,  which  the  Doctor  proposes</span><span>  to  do,  he  will  take  the  most  practicable  direct</span><span>  route  to  Swan  River,  his  whole  course  form-</span><span>  ing,  as  it  were,  the  arc  of  a  circle.  His</span><span>  arrival  at  Brisbane,  with  a  more  numerous</span><span>  and  better  appointed  party  than  his  last,  prepara-</span><span>  tory  to  starting,  may  be  expected  in  about  six</span><span>  months  hence,  or  sooner,  if  possible.  Heaven</span><span>  speed  and  prosper  him  on  his  way.</span></p> <p><span>  As  far  as  is  yet  known,  the  expedition  of  Sir</span><span>  Thomas  Mitchell  has  not  been  attended  with  any</span><span>  results  requiring  remark.  His  expedition  at  the  out-</span><span>  set  was  somewhat  retarded  by  an  unexpected  want</span><span>  of  water  in  the  Bogan,  by  many  of  his  working</span><span>  bullocks  becoming  useless,  from  the  effects  of  bad</span><span>  and  scanty  feed,  and  by  the  consequent  necessity</span><span>  of  procuring  others  in  their  stead.  We  fear  that</span><span>  Sir  Thomas  and  his  party  will  have  already  suffered</span><span>  much  from  the  recent  calamitous  drought.</span><span>  Private  letters  were  received  from  him  in  Sydney</span><span>  on  the  30th  ultimo  ;  they  do  not  contain  any</span><span>  news,  not  even  the  latitude  and  longitude  of  the</span><span>  place  where  the  letters  were  written.  He  had  re-</span><span>  ceived  the  despatches  forwarded  last  March,  an-</span><span>  nouncing  Dr.  Leichhardt's  return.</span></p> <p><span>  We  cannot  quit  the  subject  of  Exploration,</span><span>  without  remarking  on  an  unfair  attempt  by  an</span><span>  able  Sydney  contemporary,  to  render  Leichhardt's</span><span>  distinguished  success  the  basis  of  sundry  dis-</span><span>  paraging  allusions  to  Captain  Sturt,  the  published</span><span>  account  of  whose  expedition  must  be  yet  fresh  in</span><span>  the  minds  of  our  readers.  The  cases  are  not</span><span>  parallel.  Sturt  did  all  that  man  could  do,  under</span></p> <p><span>  the  circumstances.  For  several  hundred  miles</span></p> <p><span>  from  the  farthest  point  to  which  he  penetrated  --</span><span>  lat.  24°  30',  long.  138  °—he  passed  through  a</span><span>  country  wearing  an  unvarying  aspect  of  barren,</span><span>  hopeless,  unmitigated  sterility-sterility  aggra-</span><span>  vated  by  a  lengthened  drought-vast  sandstone</span><span>  wastes,  without  grass  or  water,  whose  appalling</span><span>  solitudes  were  unrelieved  by  either  vegetable  or</span><span>  animal  life.  Any  man  ungifted  with  Sturt's  per-</span><span>  severance,  skill,  and  coinage  would  have  shrunk</span><span>  from  the  task  he  took  upon  himself.  In  his  re-</span><span>  treat  from  that  terrible  desert,  never  before  tra-</span><span>  versed  by  man,  he  had  to  journey  distances  of</span><span>  forty,  seventy,  and,  on  one  occasion,  of  one  hun-</span><span>  dred  and  five  miles  before  he  could  obtain  water,</span><span>  and  then  only  on  the  surface,  and  in  quantities  so</span><span>  small,  that,  in  a  country  of  such  aridity  and  high</span><span>  temperature,  and  consequent  rapid  evaporation,</span><span>  a  few  days  later  would,  so  far  as  human  know-</span><span>  ledge  can  foresee,  have  rendered  his  retreat  im-</span><span>  practicable.  Not  even  the  iron  hand  of  sickness</span><span>  subdued  his  lofty  purpose,  and  high  determination.</span></p> <p><span>  *  The  Rev.  W.  B.  Clarke,  in  a  recent  commu-</span><span>  nication  to  the  Sydney  Herald,  expresses  his</span><span>  opinion  that  ""  Sturt's  desert,  Leichhardt's  expe-</span><span>  rience  of  little  or  no  rain,  even  in  the  tropics,  Sir</span><span>  T.  L.  Mitchell's  sufferings  from  want  of  water,</span><span>  and  the  state  of  the  colony  generally,  prove  this</span><span>  to  have  been  a  year  of  drought  parallel  with  the</span><span>  season  of  1826-7,  and  certainly  adding  another</span><span>  link  to  the  chain  of  facts  for  establishing  an  at-</span><span>  mospheric  cycle  of  nineteen  years.""</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  The  warm  welcome  he  received  upon  his  return,</span><span>  proves  how  high  the  people  of  South  Australia</span><span>  valued  his  exertions.

There  was  no  offer  for  the  land  in</span><span>  North  Brisbane,  which  is  to  be  attributed</span><span>  to  the  incorrect  and  injudicious  statement</span><span>  of  the  Colonial  Secretary  in  the  Legislative</span><span>  Council,  on  the  14th  instant,  as  reported</span><span>  in  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald,  to  the</span><span>  effect  that  Brisbane  could  not  long  be  the</span><span>  commercial  town  for  this  district,  in  con-</span><span>  sequence  of  the  bar  which  prevented  ves-</span><span>  sels  of  any  size  coming  up  the  river.</span><span>  The  Colonial  Secretary  also  stated  that</span><span>  the  Police  Magistrate  was  at  present  en-</span><span>  gaged  in  fixing  the  site  for  the  new  town,</span><span>  which  is  not  the  fact  ;  and,  we  believe,</span><span>  no  instructions  have  yet  been  sent  to  him</span><span>  for  that  purpose.  We  deprecate  state-</span><span>  ments  of  this  kind,  because  they  are  cal-</span><span>  culated  to  do  a  great  deal  of  harm  to</span><span>  existing  interests  ;  they  are  productive  of</span><span>  much  mischief,  and  tend  more  than  any-</span><span>  thing  else  to  put  a  stop  to  improvements.</span><span>  So  strong  was  the  feeling  against  the</span><span>  Government,  that  no  one  attempted  to  bid</span><span>  for  land  in  North  Brisbane,  and  while</span><span>  such  misrepresentations  remain  unex-</span><span>  plained,  we  are  quite  certain  that  they</span><span>  will  not  be  able  to  dispose  of  another  acre</span><span>  in  the  township.

Cleveland  Point  may  possibly</span><span>  turn  out  to  be  a  good  roadstead,  but  as  it</span><span>  has  not  been  accurately  surveyed,  we  are,  at</span><span>  present,  entirely  in  the  dark  with  respect</span><span>  to  its  capabilities  as  a  secure  harbour.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  more  than  once  seen  the  mis-</span></p> <p><span>  chief,  the  downright  evil  growing  out  of</span><span>  the  habit  of  exaggerating  and  misrepre-</span><span>  senting  in  general  for  the  purpose  of  ad-</span></p> <p><span>  vancing,  selfish  and  singular  interests,</span><span>  and  we  set  these  facts  before  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  to  prevent,  if  possible,  recurrence</span><span>  to  a  practice  the  tendency  of  which  is  to</span><span>  encourage  speculation,  and  to  injure  the</span><span>  properties  of  individuals  who  have  been</span><span>  confiding  in,  and  simple  enough  to  place</span><span>  reliance  on,  the  promises  of  such  a  reckless</span><span>  and  headstrong  Governor  as  Sir  George</span><span>  Gipps.

"<p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  OCTOBER  3,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  SIR  CHARLES  FITZROY'S  first  speech  to  the</span><span>  Legislative  Council  has  more  than  satisfied</span><span>  public  expectation.  It  is,  to  use  the</span><span>  language  of  Mr.  Wentworth,  ""  unlike  any-</span><span>  thing  in  the  shape  of  an  address  from  the</span><span>  Governor""  heard  by  the  Representatives</span><span>  of  the  People  before.  It  is,  in  our  humble</span><span>  judgment,  exactly  what,  under  all  circum-</span></p> <p><span>  stances,  it  should  have  been.  ""  There  is</span><span>  in  it,""  says  the  Sydney  Herald,  ""  so</span><span>  much  of  the  simplicity  of  truth-so  evi-</span></p> <p><span>  dent  an  earnestness  to  win  the  confidence</span></p> <p><span>  and  meet  the  reasonable  expectations  of</span><span>  the  community-so  entire  a  freedom  from</span><span>  all  pre-conceived  impressions-so  prudent</span><span>  a  determination  to  await  the  teachings  of</span><span>  local  experience-that,  for  our  own  part,</span><span>  we  augur  from  it  everything  that  a  mild</span><span>  and  equitable  Government  can  contribute</span></p> <p><span>  to  the  public  prosperity.''

There  is</span><span>  little  doubt,  therefore,  should  the  land  in</span><span>  the  neighbourhood  of  these  places  be</span><span>  suitable  for  cultivation,  one  or  the  other</span><span>  will  be  selected  as  the  site  of  the  proposed</span><span>  settlement.  One  thing  is  certain—the</span><span>  capital  will  not  be  at  Wide  Bay.</span></p> <p><span>  We  understand  that  upwards  of  three</span><span>  thousand  prisoners  will  be  sent  to  the  new</span><span>  colony  immediately  after  the  site  has  been</span><span>  determined  on.  They  will  be  under  a</span><span>  probationary  term  of  twelve  months,  dur-</span><span>  ing  which  period  they  will  be  employed</span><span>  in  building  stores,  wharves,  hospital,  &c.</span><span>  Each  vessel  will  bring  out  a  supply  of</span></p> <p><span>  stores  for  twelve  months  for  the  number</span><span>  of  souls  on  board  ;  and  all  the  provisions</span><span>  and  implements  of  husbandry  will  be</span><span>  placed  in  charge  of  D.  A.  C.  G.  Connel,</span><span>  assisted  by  a  storekeeper,  issuers,  clerks,</span><span>  &c.  At  the  expiration  of  their  period  of</span><span>  probation,  the  prisoners  will  be  at  liberty</span><span>  to  proceed  to  any  of  the  Australian  colo-</span><span>  nies,  and  enter  into  engagements.  Should</span><span>  they  choose  to  remain,  they  will  be  en-</span><span>  titled,  according  to  the  proposed  regula-</span><span>  tions,  to  as  much  land  as  they  can  culti-</span><span>  vate,  for  the  term  of  three  years,  rent  free  ;</span><span>  and  if,  at  the  end  of  that  time,  the  occu-</span><span>  piers  of  such  lands  be  desirous  to  purchase,</span><span>  they  will  be  permitted  to  do  so  by  pre-</span><span>  emption  of  sale,  at  £1  per  acre,  payable</span><span>  in  ten  equal  annual  instalments.  Settlers</span><span>  wishing  to  emigrate,  may  purchase  lands</span><span>  in  the  new  colony,  at  auction,  at  the</span><span>  minimum  upset  price  of  £1  per  acre;</span></p> <p><span>  we  are  not  informed  whether  the  same</span></p> <p><span>  indulgence  with  respect  to  payment  will</span><span>  be  granted  to  them.</span></p> <p><span>  The  prisoners  are,  moreover,  to  be  fur-</span><span>  nished  with  cattle,  sheep,  and  implements;</span><span>  and  with  this  view  the  Government  herds</span><span>  and  flocks  now  at  Moreton  Bay  will  be</span></p> <p><span>  sent  overland  as  soon  as  the  site  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  colony  is  fixed.</span></p> <p><span>  Such  being  the  conditions  and  regula-</span><span>  tions  under  which  the  new  colony  is  about</span><span>  to  be  established,  it  is  of  the  utmost  im-</span><span>  portance  that  not  only  a  good  situation,</span><span>  but  the  best  situation,  should  be  selected</span><span>  —the  one  combining  the  greatest  number</span><span>  of  advantages  with  respect  to  security,</span><span>  soil,  supply  of  water,  and  facilities  for</span></p> <p><span>  external  and  interior  communication.  An</span></p> <p><span>  injudicious  selection  will  retard  the  pros-</span><span>  perity  of  the  colony  for  years.  The  most</span><span>  important  features  in  the  proposed  regu-</span><span>  lations  are  the  assignment  of  land  to  the</span><span>  prisoners,  and  the  liberal  terms  on  which</span><span>  it  may  be  purchased  by  them.  Such</span><span>  policy  will  be  highly  conducive  to  the</span><span>  success,  and  rapid  developement  of  the</span><span>  resources,  of  the  province.  Should  the</span><span>  views  as  promulgated  by  the  Government</span><span>  be  carried  out  in  respect  of  the  disposal</span><span>  of  land  to  the  probationers,  they  will  be</span><span>  productive  of  the  most  important  conse-</span><span>  quences  to  this  colony  ;  and  we  venture</span><span>  to  predict  that  the  absurd  and  infamous</span><span>  £1  per  acre  Waste  Land  Act  will  not</span><span>  survive  the  next  session  of  the  Imperial</span><span>  Legislature.

"<p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  OCTOBER  17,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  In  our  last  number  we  expressed  our</span><span>  opinion  that  the  Government,  by  exact-</span><span>  ing  a  higher  price  for  land  in  this  colony</span><span>  than  better  land  is  fetching  in  other  places</span><span>  nearer  to  the  great  European  markets,  had</span><span>  rendered  waste  lands  for  agricultural  pur-</span><span>  poses  unsaleable,  and  that  the  whole  sys-</span><span>  tem  of  -Sir  George  Gipps  -was  an  error  in</span><span>  political  economy,  and  that  his  regulations</span><span>  have  been  productive  of  the  most  baneful</span><span>  effects  to  this  district  in  particular.</span></p> <p><span>  When  we  reflect  upon  the  number  of</span><span>  persons  who  annually  emigrate  to  these</span><span>  colonies  without  any  definite  views  as  to</span><span>  their  ultimate  proceedings,  and  also  find</span><span>  that  the  greater  portion  of  those  who  em-</span><span>  bark  in  agricultural  and  pastoral  pursuits</span><span>  scarcely  know  a  ploughshare  from  a  hay-</span><span>  fork,  much  less  a  Leicester  or  Southdown</span><span>  sheep  from  a  Merino,  it  is  more  surprising</span><span>  to  find  so  many  become  extensive  and</span><span>  successful  flockmasters,  than  to  hear  oc-</span><span>  casionally  of  persons  who  are  said  to  be</span><span>  disappointed  in  their  expectations  respect-</span><span>  ing  the  country  of  their  adoption.  Now</span></p> <p><span>  as  the  settler  must  look  for  his  income</span></p> <p><span>  from  the  profits  of  his  capital,  he  will</span><span>  naturally  invest  his  money  in  the  most</span><span>  lucrative  business.  He  will,  of  course,  if</span><span>  he  lays  it  out  in  agricultural  or  pastoral</span><span>  pursuits,  ascertain  what  the  return  of</span><span>  profit  is  likely  to  be.  Should  his  taste</span><span>  lead  him  to  attempt  the  cultivation  of</span><span>  land,  he  will  find  that  the  impediments</span><span>  which  now  discredit  our  local  adminis</span><span>  rat.on  are  insurmountable  ;  that  the  high</span><span>  price  of  land  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the</span><span>  townships,  is  an  obstacle  not  to  be  over-</span><span>  come  by  the  most  enterprising.  Whereas</span><span>  if  the  Government  would  adopt  a  different</span><span>  system-if  they  would  even  put  up  the</span><span>  suburban  and  country  lots  at  one  pound</span><span>  per  acre  (their  utmost  value),  hundreds</span><span>  of  acres  would  find  purchasers,  and  the</span><span>  nucleus  of  an  agricultural  population</span><span>  would  be  formed-persons  who  would</span><span>  convert  the  wilds  into  animated  scenes  ;</span><span>  for  with  good  land  at  a  moderate  price,</span></p> <p><span>  there  can  be  no  doubt  there  is  still  an</span></p> <p><span>  ample  field  for  the  profitable  employment</span><span>  of  capital  ;  that  small  farmers  with  mo-</span><span>  derate  means,  combined  with  industry</span><span>  and  perseverance,  as  well  as  those  whose</span><span>  only  capital  is  honesty,  sobriety,  and  in-</span><span>  dustry,  may  find  a  realization  of  those</span><span>  hopes  which  cheered  them  on  leaving</span><span>  their  native  land,  and  who  will,  with</span><span>  proper  management,  meet  with  that  suc-</span><span>  cess  which  the  soil  and  climate  of  this</span><span>  part  of  the  colony  ensure  them.</span></p> <p><span>  Almost  all  our  reflections  on  statistics,</span><span>  the  geography  of  the  world,  the  growth</span><span>  and  decline  of  different  states,  and  the</span><span>  condition  of  mankind  in  general,  lead  us</span><span>  to  acknowledge  the  necessity,  and  hence</span><span>  the  wisdom  of  God,  that  the  whole  earth</span><span>  should  be  replenished,  and  that  population</span><span>  should  spread  over  the  entire  surface  of</span><span>  the  earth.  This  is  now  being  accom-</span><span>  plished,  and  when  we  consider  these</span><span>  things,  it  appears  to  us  of  less  consequence</span><span>  as  to  the  part  of  the  globe  on  which  we</span><span>  are  to  finish  our  days,  so  as  that  we  do</span><span>  not  consider  ourselves  out  of  the  presence</span><span>  of  Him  who  fills  the  universe,  and  who</span><span>  is  always  to  be  found  the  best  friend,  into</span><span>  whatever  part  a  man  may  be  exiled.  If</span><span>  we  could  sincerely  realize  the  conviction,</span><span>  we  should  little  regret  the  loss  of  country,</span><span>  convinced  that  at  these  antipodes  we  shall,</span><span>  as  it  regards  our  final  destination,  be  no</span><span>  more  strangers  on  earth,  than  at  the  place</span></p> <p><span>  of  our  birth.</span></p> <p><span>  Considerations  of  these  higher  impor-</span><span>  tant  things  than  worldly  affairs,  may  re-</span><span>  concile  (as  they  ought  to  do)  many  persons</span><span>  who,  from  necessity,  are  obliged  to  leave</span><span>  their  native  shores  ;  and  were  it  not  for</span></p> <p><span>  this  exigency,  great  part  of  the  world,</span><span>  might  remain  a  desert,  as  undoubtedly,</span><span>  our  country  would  be  at  this  day,  had  not</span><span>  its  present  inhabitants  been  originally</span><span>  exiled  or  driven  from  the  mother  country,</span><span>  or  tempted  by  the  aspect  of  this,  to  seek</span><span>  a  refuge  and  a  home  in  its  uncultivated</span><span>  forests.  The  colonists  are  continually</span><span>  opening  out  new  prospects  of  adventure,</span><span>  and  are  forming  fresh  sources  of  trade  and</span><span>  traffic,  while  they  tend  to  spread  civiliza-</span><span>  tion  and  social  virtue,  as  well  as  endeavour</span><span>  to  impart  knowledge  to  the  rude  and  un-</span><span>  lettered  denizens  of  the  Australian  wilds.</span><span>  They  who  have  the  spirit  to  encounter</span><span>  emigration,  will  often  render  benefits  to</span><span>  their  descendants,  which  the  utmost  exer-</span><span>  tions,  pains,  and  privations  could  not  have</span><span>  accomplished  in  their  native  country.</span></p> <p><span>  Experience  teaches  us  that  population</span><span>  more  than  keeps  pace  with  the  improve-</span><span>  ments  in  land  ;  and  years  frequently</span><span>  elapse  before  waste  grounds  can  be  brought</span><span>  into  a  productive  condition.  The  only  way</span><span>  to  promote  extensive  agriculture  is  to  hold</span><span>  out  strong  inducements  to  persons  with</span><span>  small  capital  to  settle  in  those  districts  where</span><span>  agriculturists  are  most  required.  Let  them</span><span>  select  from  fifty  to  one  hundred  acres  each,</span><span>  as  may  be  suitable  to  their  means,  and  let</span><span>  it  be  leased  to  them  for  seven  years,  when</span><span>  the  farms  could  be  sold  at  the  market</span><span>  price-that  is  for  what  they  would  fetch</span></p> <p><span>  -and  allow  the  tenant  a  sum  out  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  purchase  money  for  his  improvements,  in</span><span>  the  event  of  his  not  being  able  to  buy  the</span><span>  land  himself.  A  plan  like  this,  if  pro-</span><span>  perly  carried  out,  would  produce  a  great</span><span>  change  -  its  advantages  to  this  district</span><span>  .would  soon  be  made  apparent.  In  the</span><span>  course  of  a  few  years,  we  should  be  ena-</span><span>  bled  to  grow  sufficient  corn  for  our  own</span><span>  support.  The  money  which  now  is  sent</span><span>  out  of  this  district,  annually,  and  which</span></p> <p><span>  at  the  lowest  calculation  amounts  to</span></p> <p><span>  £10,000,  would  be  spent  here-would  cir-</span><span>  culate  amongst  us  for  our  mutual  benefit,</span><span>  and  give  stability  to  commercial  operations.</span></p> <p><span>  During  the  discussion  of  this  question</span><span>  in  the  Legislative  Council,  Mr.  Robinson</span><span>  brought  under  the  notice  of  the  House</span><span>  certain  propositions  which  had  been  pub-</span><span>  lished  in  1844  by  Mr.  Lowe,  under  the</span><span>  title  of  ""  Rent  better  Sale,""  which  he  said</span><span>  were  strangely  contrasted  with  the  opinions</span><span>  expressed  by  Mr.  Lowe  in  1846.  In  sup-</span><span>  port  of  the  position,  the  honorable  member</span></p> <p><span>  for  Auckland  then  said</span></p> <p><span>  Because  in  every  new  country  profits  are  high,</span><span>  and  capital  scarce  ;  in  such  a  country,  therefore,</span><span>  it  is  especially  necessary  to  tax  profits  rather  than</span><span>  capital.</span></p> <p><span>  Because  the  principle  of  buying  lands,  not  for</span><span>  the  sake  of  what  they  contain,  but  of  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  run  they  command,  gives  an  unjust  mono-</span><span>  poly  to  the  purchaser,  and  an  undue  influence  to</span><span>  the  Government  ;  and  yet  no  one  has  ever  thought</span><span>  of  buying  lands  in  New  South  Wales  on  any  other</span><span>  principle.</span></p> <p><span>  Because  it  is  a  sound  maxim  in  finance,  never</span><span>  to  raise  money  till  you  want  it  ;  capital  increases</span><span>  fast  in  the  hands  of  an  industrious  people;  but</span><span>  slowly,  or  not  at  all,  in  those  of  a  Government.</span></p> <p><span>  Because  a  steady  income  is  far  more  valuable  to</span><span>  a  state  than  a  large  sum  of  ready  money,  the</span><span>  effects  of  an  imprudent  outlay  of  the  one  being</span><span>  much  less  pernicious  than  of  the  other.</span></p> <p><span>  Because,  if  the  State  be  anxious  to  raise  a  sum</span><span>  of  ready  money,  this  can  always  be  effected  by</span><span>  allowing  the  grantees  to  redeem  their  rents  at  a</span><span>  reasonable  number  of  years'  purchase.</span></p> <p><span>  Because  there  is  no  necessary  connexion  between</span><span>  emigration  and  the  sale  or  letting  of  land  ;  but</span><span>  there  is  a  necessary  connexion  between  emigration</span><span>  and  the  general  welfare  of  the  colony  ;  the  expense</span><span>  of  emigration,  therefore,  ought  not  to  be  defrayed</span><span>  out  of  the  revenue  arising  from  lands,  which  may</span><span>  be  greater  or  less  than  the  sum  required,  but  out</span><span>  of  the  general  revenue  of  the  colony  of  which  that</span><span>  land  revenue  should  form  a  part.</span></p> <p><span>  Because  a  revenue  arising  from  rent  offers  much</span><span>  better  security  for  the  loan  proposed  to  be  effected</span><span>  for  the  purposes  of  systematic  colonization  than</span><span>  one  arising  from  the  sale  of  land,  since  the  one  is</span><span>  paid  out  of  interest  and  the  other  out  of  principal.</span></p> <p><span>  Because  people  will  much  more  readily  buy  up</span><span>  land  on  speculation,  than  pay  a  yearly  rent  for  it.</span></p> <p><span>  Because  the  recent  instances  of  Canada,  and  of</span><span>  the  Church  and  School  Lands  in  this  colony  show,</span><span>  that  small  capitalists  prefer  renting  to  buying.</span></p> <p><span>  Because  the  whole  capital  of  each  settler  would</span><span>  thus  be  left  at  his  disposal,  and  permanent  im-</span><span>  provements  be  proportionably  rapid.</span></p> <p><span>  And  again,  with  regard  to  the  matter  of</span><span>  the  political  effect  of  such  a  system  on  a</span></p> <p><span>  nation  :</span></p> <p><span>  Because  it  is  not  true  that  whatever  the  colonist</span><span>  gains  in  the  bargain,  the  Government  (that  is  the</span><span>  colony)  loses.  It  is  the  interest  of  the  colony  to</span><span>  dispose  of  its  waste  lands  on  the  easiest  terms</span><span>  consistent  with  the  requisite  adjustment  of  labour</span><span>  nd  capital,  If  the  money  be  left  in  the  colonist'</span><span>  pocket  it  can  always  be  extracted  by  taxation  ;  if</span><span>  once  raised  and  recklessly  spent,  who  can  re-</span></p> <p><span>  call  it  ?</span></p> <p><span>  Because  it  is  of  no  importance  to  the  community</span><span>  whether  these  lands  are  in  many  or  few  hands  ;</span><span>  but  it  is  of  importance  to  the  community  to  retain</span><span>  its  capital,  to  lighten  its  taxation,  and  to  make  the</span><span>  wilderness  useful  to  the  support  of  man.</span></p> <p><span>  Because  that  Mill,  in  his  first  volume  of  his</span><span>  History  of  India,  and  in  his  Political  Economy,</span><span>  and  also  Mr.  Ricardo,  and  Adam  Smith,  are</span></p> <p><span>  favourable  to  this  plan  of  raising  a  revenue  ;  and</span><span>  because  it  is  believed  that  there  is  no  authority</span><span>  against  it.</span></p> <p><span>  Because  the  Ryotwar  system  of  India,  the  Land</span><span>  tax  of  England,  and  the  agrarian  laws  of  Rome,</span><span>  show  that  this  system  readily  coalesces  with  every</span><span>  form  of  Government,  and  therefore  that  no  political</span><span>  change  need  be  feared  from  it.</span></p> <p><span>  After  reading  the  foregoing  proposi-</span><span>  tions,  will  it  be  believed  that  the  same</span><span>  man  who  wrote  them  now  repudiates  all</span></p> <p><span>  occupation  of  waste  lands  except  by  pur-</span><span>  chase.  Every  man  is  certainly  entitled</span><span>  to  change  his  opinions-to  modify  them</span><span>  at  any  time  he  may  think  proper  ;  but</span><span>  there  is  a  limit  to  which  every  one  should</span><span>  be  confined,  and  more  particularly  that</span><span>  man  whose  abilities  necessarily  give</span><span>  him  much  influence  in  political  affairs.</span><span>  When  we  see  the  honourable  member</span><span>  for  Auckland  rush  from  one  extreme</span><span>  opinion  to  another,  without  giving  any</span><span>  satisfactory  explanation,  we  can  only  at-</span><span>  tribute  the  change  to  an  aberration  of</span><span>  mind-an  eccentricity  of  intellect  which</span><span>  is  no  excuse  for  that  to  which  he  pleaded</span><span>  guilty-his  former  inexperience  in  poli-</span><span>  tics.  Mr.  Lowe  is  not  a  safe  guide,  and</span><span>  as  he  has  changed  his  opinions  once  on</span><span>  this  question,  it  is  more  than  probable</span><span>  he  will  do  so  again.  We  shall  be</span><span>  proud  to  record  them,  should  our  sur-</span></p> <p><span>  mises  turn  out  to  be  well  founded.</span></p> <p><span>  We  are  ever  ready  to  encounter  all  fair</span><span>  and  reasonable  hazards  in  giving  publicity</span><span>  to  wrongs  suffered  by  persons  in  the  two</span><span>  districts  ;  but,  at  the  same  time,  it  must</span><span>  be  acknowledged  that  we  have  arrived  to</span><span>  that  state  of  things  wherein  truth  should</span><span>  display  an  unshrinking  courage,  and,  in</span><span>  announcing  facts,  or  denouncing  acts  of</span><span>  injustice,  no  one  should  invest  himself</span><span>  with  the  panoply  of  concealment.  We,</span><span>  therefore,  wish  our  correspondents  would</span><span>  subscribe  their  real  signatures,  and  we</span><span>  shall  expect  in  future  that  those  who</span><span>  would  have  us,  as  public  journalists,  fight</span><span>  their  battles,  will  share  in  the  responsi-</span><span>  bilities  which  may  attach  to  their  com-</span></p> <p><span>  munications.</span></p> ",Article,1846-10-17,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

The  late  frightful</span><span>  tragedy,  with  its  somewhat  farcical  ending,</span></p> <p><span>  is  scarcely  over  ;  yet  our  local  columns  of</span><span>  to-day  record  another  revolting  outrage.</span><span>  And  this  with  scarcely  an  effort  being</span><span>  made  to  inflict  such  punishment  as  might</span><span>  serve  effectually  to  prevent  the  commission</span></p> <p><span>  of  similar  atrocities.</span></p> <p><span>  Are  there  no  means  of  checking  so</span></p> <p><span>  fearful  a  waste  of  human  life  ?  Shall  a</span></p> <p><span>  handful  of  miserable  savages,  secure  in  the</span><span>  supinity  of  our  rulers,  go  on  adding  victim</span><span>  to  victim,  robbery  to  robbery,  until  their</span><span>  thrist  for  blood  and  plunder,  growing  by</span></p> <p><span>  what  it  feeds  on,  becomes  so  enormous</span><span>  that  we  must  either  flee  like  cowards  from</span></p> <p><span>  the  land,  or  sweep  them  from  existence.</span><span>  It  is  useless-worse  than  useless-to  bring</span></p> <p><span>  the  cumbrous  panoply  of  constitutional</span><span>  law  to  defend  us  from  the  aggressions  of</span><span>  those  who  know  not,  and  cannot  be  made</span><span>  to  comprehend  the  civil  defences  with</span><span>  which  we  have  hemmed  in  our  lives  and</span></p> <p><span>  properties.  To  do  so,  is  to  bring  one  of</span><span>  our  most  sacred  ordinances  into  contempt</span><span>  -to  perpetrate  a  solemn  mockery,  and  giv-</span><span>  ing  the  blacks  confidence  in  our  apparent</span><span>  weakness,  peril  the  lives  of  our  distant  and</span><span>  isolated  friends  in  the  interior.</span></p> <p><span>  We  know  enough  of  the  aborigines  to</span></p> <p><span>  be  aware  that,  as  is  customary  amongst</span></p> <p><span>  almost  all  savages,  all  projects  of  love  or</span><span>  war,  all  expeditions  of  an  unusual  nature,</span><span>  are  first  debated  by  the  whole  adult  males</span><span>  of  a  tribe.  Consequently,  according  to</span><span>  our  law,  to  every  outrage  committed  upon</span><span>  the  whites  they  are  all  accessaries-a  class</span></p> <p><span>  of  criminals  whose  punishment  is  often</span><span>  well  nigh  equal  to  that  of  their  principals</span></p> <p><span>  in  crime.  But  in  our  Courts  of  Justice</span></p> <p><span>  the  evidence  of  a  black  is  barely  admissi-</span><span>  ble,  and  where  all  are  participators,  and</span><span>  unlikely  to  betray  each  other,  we  have</span><span>  nothing  but  moral  conviction  to  guide  us</span><span>  in  ascertaining  the  degree  of  guiltiness  of</span><span>  a  whole  tribe.  And  even  could  this  be</span></p> <p><span>  legally  ascertained,  on  undeniable  proof,</span><span>  what  would  be  our  remedy  ?  It  is  a</span><span>  glorious  privilege  of  every  British  subject</span><span>  that,  before  he  can  be  tried,  he  must  be</span><span>  capable  of  understanding  the  objects  and</span><span>  process  of  legal  investigation,  and  the</span><span>  nature  of  Trial  by  Jury  ;  and  unless  he</span><span>  is  capable  of  comprehending  these  he  is</span></p> <p><span>  treated  as  an  idiot-as  an  infant,  rather</span><span>  to  be  protected  by  the  law  than  visited</span><span>  with  its  terrors.  In  such  a  position  stand</span><span>  the  blacks-their  perceptions  limited  by</span><span>  their  senses,  incapable  of  forming  aught</span><span>  like  an  abstract  idea,  but  few  amongst</span><span>  them  approach  that  degree  of  knowledge</span><span>  and  intelligence  without  which  guilt,  in</span><span>  the  eye  of  the  law,  cannot  exist  !</span></p> <p><span>  And  this  is  British  Justice  !  Justice</span><span>  to  the  hardy  sons  of  Britain  who  are  en-</span><span>  gaged  in  transforming  a  territory,  before</span><span>  waste  and  unprofitable,  into  one  of  her</span><span>  most  flourishing  and  important  dependen-</span><span>  cies.  This  is  national  consistency  !  A</span><span>  jealous  sense  of  honour  is  incessantly</span><span>  leading  our  statesmen  to  regard  the  acts</span><span>  of  individuals  as  the  acts  of  the  nations</span><span>  to  which  they  belong,  thereby  endanger-</span><span>  ing  the  welfare  and  happiness  of  civilized</span></p> <p><span>  millions.  But  the  crimes  of  a  tribe  of  sa-</span></p> <p><span>  vages,  whom  no  kindness  can  conciliate,</span><span>  are  treated  as  the  crimes  of  a  single  indivi-</span><span>  dual,  and  his  equally  guilty  compeers  are</span><span>  suffered  to  escape  !  To  use  an  expression</span><span>  of  a  celebrated  Frenchwoman  (addressed</span><span>  to  a  statue  of  Liberty)  with  a  change  of</span><span>  phrase,  ""  Oh,  Justice,  Justice,  what  ab-</span><span>  surdities  are  perpetrated  in  thy  name  !""</span></p> <p><span>  Seriously,  solemnly  do  we  ask,  what  is</span><span>  to  be  done  ?  Because  the  question  is</span><span>  surrounded  with  difficulty,  are  we  to  re-</span><span>  main  without  protection,  waiting  to  be</span><span>  cut  down  like  ears  before  the  sickle-</span></p> <p><span>  bound  hand  and  foot  by  the  terrors  of  a</span><span>  one-sided  law,  which  in  our  relations  to</span><span>  the  blacks,  threatens  instead  of  protecting</span></p> <p><span>  us  ?  Either  the  authorities  will  have  to</span></p> <p><span>  shut  their  eyes  while  we  take  the  law</span><span>  into  our  own  hands,  or  they  must  afford</span><span>  us  that  protection  which  was  erewhile  the</span></p> <p><span>  glory  and  safeguard  of  every  Englishman</span><span>  throughout  the  world.</span></p> <p><span>  DR.  LEICHHARDT  and  his  party,  that</span><span>  ""  band  of  brothers,""  as  they  have  been</span><span>  happily  termed,  intend  starting  from</span><span>  Jimba,  Darling  Downs  on  the  1st  proxi-</span><span>  mo.  The  Doctor,  we  are  sorry  to  learn,</span><span>  is  unable  to  visit  Brisbane  ;  his  anxiety</span><span>  to  reach  Peak  Range  before  the  summer</span><span>  rains  set  in,  leading  him  to  use  every</span><span>  possible  personal  exertion  to  expedite  his</span><span>  departure.  He  is  said  to  be  in  high</span><span>  spirits,  and  well  satisfied  with  the  de-</span><span>  meanour  and  fitness  of  those  who  are</span><span>  about  to  accompany  him.</span></p> <p><span>  Leichhardt's  inabiliiy  to  come  amongst</span><span>  us,  will  form  matter  of  general  regret.</span></p> <p><span>  The  number  in  Brisbane  is  small  indeed</span></p> <p><span>  who  are  unprepared  to  do  honour  to  his</span><span>  worth  and  high-mindedness.  Gladly</span><span>  would  we  have  seen  him  face  to  face,</span><span>  have  again  heard  the  tones  of  his  voice,</span><span>  ere  he  engaged  in  a  task,  the  fulfilment</span><span>  of  which,  attended  with  no  ordinary</span><span>  dangers,  demands  the  highest  exertion  of</span><span>  mind  and  body.  Visit  Brisbane  or  not,</span><span>  however,  we  are  sure  that  our  readers  will</span><span>  not  the  less  regard  the  man  who  has  al-</span><span>  ready  done  so  much-and  will,  we  hope,</span><span>  do  more-to  add  to  our  knowledge  of  the</span><span>  resources  of  Australia.</span></p> <p><span>  As  an  explorer,  Leichhardt  already</span><span>  stands  in  the  first  rank.

"<p></p> <p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  OCTOBER  31,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Renewal  of  Transportation-the  in-</span><span>  troduction  of  an  abundant  supply  of  cheap</span><span>  labour-are  essentially  necessary  to  the</span><span>  future  rapid  prosperity  of  this  colony,  for</span><span>  whoever  attentively  considers  the  social</span><span>  State  in  this  country  and  the  present  con-</span><span>  dition  of  the  employers  and  the  employed,</span></p> <p><span>  will  find  that  owing  to  the  great  scarcity</span><span>  of  labourers,  wages  have  risen  to  such  a</span><span>  height  that  stock-keeping,  except  in</span><span>  peculiarly  favoured  localities  has  well</span><span>  nigh  ceased  to  be  profitable  :  that  while</span><span>  the  employer  is  put  to  his  wit's  end  to  pay</span><span>  his  shepherds,  the  latter  are  daily  increas-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  their  demands  upon  his  pocket  ;  and</span><span>  instead  of  performing  their  duties  better,</span><span>  as  they  ought  to  do  when  they  are  highly</span><span>  remunerated,  we  find  them  careless  and</span><span>  insolent-idle  and  knavish-bolting  from</span><span>  the  stations  in  every  direction-knowing</span><span>  well,  as  they  do,  that  hitherto  there  has</span><span>  been  but  little  chance  of  competition  in</span><span>  the  labour  market.  We  hail,  therefore,</span><span>  with  satisfaction  the  proposal  of  the  Se-</span><span>  cretary  of  State,  as  announced  in  the  des-</span><span>  patch,  which  we  published  in  our  last</span><span>  number,  to  renew  transportation  to  these</span></p> <p><span>  colonies.  It  will  be  seen  by  that  docu-</span><span>  ment  that  he  brings  forward  the  question</span><span>  in  a  manly  and  straightforward  manner,</span><span>  leaving  it  to  the  colonists  to  decide  whether</span><span>  it  be  desirable  or  not  at  the  present  junc-</span><span>  ture.  Under  these  circumstances,  we  take</span><span>  advantage  of  the  opportunity  now  afforded</span><span>  us  to  express  our  views  and  opinions  on</span><span>  the  subject.</span></p> <p><span>  We  believe  that  nearly  all  the  squatters,</span><span>  and  a  majority  of  the  merchants  and</span><span>  traders  in  the  two  districts,  coincide  with</span><span>  us  in  opinion  that  the  introduction  of</span><span>  convict-labour,  under  certain  conditions,</span><span>  is  highly  desirable.  In  discussing  this</span><span>  question,  it  should  be  borne  in  mind,  that</span><span>  Government  has  permitted  the  colonists</span><span>  to  take  advantage  of  the  probation  system</span><span>  in  Van  Diemen's  Land,  and  that  for  the</span><span>  last  sixteen  months,  the  most  objectionable</span><span>  characters  have  found  their  way  from  that</span><span>  place  to  this  colony.  In  point  of  fact,</span><span>  -we  now  have  transportation  in  its  worst</span><span>  shape,  without  any  of  the  benefits  deriva</span><span>  ble  from  it.  Would  it  not,  therefore,  be</span><span>  better  to  take  the  labour  offered  to  us</span></p> <p><span>  direct  from  England?  Undoubtedly  it</span><span>  would  ;  and  the  time  chosen  to  effect  this</span><span>  vast  revolution  in  our  labour  system  is</span><span>  opportune-it  is  one  of  prosperity,  when</span><span>  employment  is  abundant  and  remuneration</span><span>  good.  There  are  abundance  of  provisions,</span><span>  and  ample  means  to  pay  the  labourers</span><span>  when  they  arrive.  And  to  crown  all,  the</span><span>  skill  and  capital  of  our  spirited  stock-</span><span>  holders  and  merchants  are  both  employed</span><span>  in  extending  the  field  of  home  produce,</span><span>  and  in  rendering  what  is  already  in  oc-</span><span>  cupation,  or  under  tillage,  more  produc-</span><span>  tive.  Let  us  learn  experience  from  the</span><span>  past.  The  discontinuance  of  the  trans-</span><span>  portation  system  with  forced  labour,  a  few</span><span>  years  back,  helped  to  introduce  the  wedge</span><span>  which  split  asunder  the  tree  of  colonial</span><span>  wealth.  Revive  that  system,-let  us</span><span>  have  cheap  labour,  and  prosperity,  un</span><span>  exampled  in  the  previous  history  of  this</span></p> <p><span>  colony,  will  most  assuredly  follow.</span></p> <p><span>  We  are  not  of  those  who  would  wish  to</span><span>  see  transportation  renewed,  if  it  were</span><span>  practicable  to  get  free  labour,  and  plenty</span></p> <p><span>  of  it.  Such,  however,  is  not  the  case  ;</span><span>  there  is  no  chance  of  emigration  to  this</span></p> <p><span>  colony  taking  place  ;  nor  is  there  any</span><span>  probability  of  our  obtaining  an  adequate</span><span>  supply  of  labourers  from  any  other  source</span><span>  than  that  evidently  determined  upon  by</span><span>  the  Home  Government.  Our  wants  are</span><span>  immediate,  and  the  difficulty  of  satisfying</span><span>  them  is  increasing  every  day.  We  believe</span><span>  that  the  evils  of  the  forced  labour  system,</span><span>  have  been  greatly  exaggerated,  and  that</span><span>  the  moral  pollution,  so  much  talked  about</span><span>  as  being  apparent  in  every  community</span><span>  where  convicts  are  placed,  is  more  ima-</span><span>  ginai  y  than  real  ;  for  it  is  quite  certain,</span><span>  and  daily  experience  proves  the  truth  of</span><span>  our  assertion,  that  the  standard  of  morality</span><span>  is  the  same  now  as  when  the  transporta-</span><span>  tion  system  was  in  its  zenith.  Employers</span></p> <p><span>  know  well  that  ticket-of-leave  men  make</span><span>  the  best  servants.  It  is  another  well-known</span></p> <p><span>  fact,  that  the  higher  the  wages,  the  more</span><span>  troublesome  the  men  become,  and  the  less</span><span>  regard  they  have  for  character.  It  is</span><span>  quite  a  mistake  for  mechanics  to  suppose</span><span>  that  the  introduction  of  convict-labourers</span></p> <p><span>  will  injure  them.  There  is  very  little</span><span>  doubt  that  the  convicts,  when  they  arrive,</span><span>  will  be  widely  and  remotely  dispersed,</span><span>  and  be  sent  away  into  the  interior,  where</span><span>  the  contaminating  influence  of  idlers  in</span><span>  the  towns  will  not  reach  them.  In  order</span><span>  to  work  out  any  reformatory  scheme,  it</span><span>  is  absolutely  necessary  that  the  scheme  and</span><span>  the  bond  should  be  amalgamated  as  much</span><span>  as  possible,  to  prevent  that  aggregation  of</span><span>  vicious  persons  which  has  hitherto  been</span><span>  found  so  prejudicial  to  the  probationers</span><span>  and  other  classes  of  prisoners  in  Van</span><span>  Diemen's  Land.  Beyond  the  boundaries</span><span>  of  location,  there  will  be  but  little  in-</span><span>  ducement  for  these  men  to  be  dishonest.</span><span>  It  is  there  they  will  have  an  opportunity</span><span>  of  throwing  off  old  habits,  and  acquiring</span><span>  new  ones  Habits  of  reflection  will  be</span><span>  superinduced  which,  if  they  are  not</span><span>  thoroughly  depraved,  must  lead  to  amend-</span><span>  ment  of  life,  and  allure  them  insensibly</span><span>  to  become  useful  members  of  society.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  important  point  should  not  be</span><span>  lost  sight  of,  and  that  is  the  equalization</span><span>  of  the  sexes.  It  is  not  necessary  to  enter</span><span>  at  length  into  the  reasons  why  such  should</span><span>  be  the  case  ;  they  must  be  obvious  to  every</span><span>  well  regulated,  and  reflecting  mind.  The</span><span>  free  and  freed  adult  males  are  already  in</span><span>  excess  in  the  colony,  and  unless  females</span><span>  are  introduced  contemporaneously  with</span><span>  males,  no  system  for  their  reformation</span><span>  can  be  ultimately  successful.  If  a  due</span><span>  proportion  of  free  women,  of  good  cha-</span><span>  racter,  could  be  sent  out,  so  much  the</span><span>  better,  as  their  humanizing  influence</span><span>  would  be  of  the  greatest  benefit  in  re-</span><span>  straining  such  of  the  convicts,  as  became</span><span>  entitled  to  marry,  from  recurring  to  vicious</span></p> <p><span>  courses.</span></p> <p><span>  If  the  Government  will  consent  to  bear</span></p> <p><span>  their  fair  proportion  of  the  expenses  at-</span><span>  tendant  upon  the  renewal  of  transportation</span><span>  to  these  colonies,  under  the  conditions</span><span>  above  mentioned,  we  must  say  that  few</span><span>  questions  have  throughout  appeared  to  us</span><span>  more  free  from  difficulty  and  perplexity.</span><span>  Should  any  of  the  convicts  be  employed</span><span>  on  the  roads,  Mr.  Gladstone  says,  that</span><span>  ""'opportunity  will  be  given  for  the  closest</span><span>  inspection,  for  subjecting  the  whole  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  tribution  of  the  time  of  the  men,  and  all</span><span>  their  habits  to  a  rigid  discipline,  and  for</span><span>  applying  to  them  the  agency  of  systematic</span><span>  and  effective  religious  instruction.""  With</span><span>  these  assurances,  we  think  the  colonists</span><span>  ought  to  be  satisfied.  The  Home  Go-</span><span>  vernment  have  already  made  proposals  to</span><span>  the  Poor-law  Guardians,  with  the  view  of</span><span>  ascertaining  how  far  they  would  be  dis-</span><span>  posed  to  mortgage  their  poor-rates,  that</span><span>  the  parish  unions  might  be  released  of</span><span>  their  paupers  ;  and  if  some  arrangement</span><span>  could  be  effected  so  as  to  provide  an  in-</span><span>  termixture  of  free  and  prison  population</span><span>  for  this  colony,  as  well  as  the  new  colony</span><span>  to  the  northward,  a  grand  step  will  have</span><span>  been  made  in  systematic  colonization</span><span>  equally  beneficial  to  both  countries.</span><span>  Here  we  have  a  wide  extent  of  territory</span><span>  prepared  for  all  the  purposes  of  civilized</span><span>  life-well  adapted  either  for  agricultural</span><span>  or  pastoral  pursuits.  Our  great  want  is</span><span>  a  labouring  population.  Let  then  the</span><span>  starving  inmates  of  the  workhouses,  and</span><span>  the  abandoned  profligate  of  the  peniten-</span><span>  tiaries,  wend  their  way  hither,  and  they</span><span>  will  soon  be  converted  into  industrious</span><span>  and  substantial  yeomen.</span></p> ",Article,1846-10-31,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

His  exertions  to  effect  an</span><span>  overland  route  to  India,  are  even  now  re-</span><span>  cognised,  and  their  effects  gratefully  ac-</span><span>  knowledged  by  the  people  of  the  colony.</span><span>  An  officer  in  the  East  India  Company's</span></p> <p><span>  service,  at  a  former  period  of  his  eventful</span><span>  life,  and  often  proceeding  from  India  to</span><span>  England,  Lieut.  Waghorn,  the  individual</span><span>  to  whom  we  allude,  felt  the  irksomeness</span><span>  as  well  as  the  cost  and  danger  of  a  voyage</span><span>  round  the  African  coast  ;  and  his  active</span></p> <p><span>  mind  soon  began  to  dwell  on  the  possi-</span><span>  bility  of  performing  the  trip  with  greater</span><span>  expedition.  Perceiving  the  advantages</span></p> <p><span>  that  would  result  from  an  overland  route</span><span>  -  -a  route  that  would  more  than  realise</span></p> <p><span>  the  ambitious  conceptions  of  the  ancient</span><span>  Pharaohs-for  many  years  he  laboured  to</span></p> <p><span>  establish  it  ;  and  at  length,  alone  and  un-</span><span>  aided,  in  the  face  of  difficulties  from  which</span><span>  almost  any  other  man  would  have  shrunk,</span><span>  having  secured  the  confidence  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Egyptian  Pasha,  Mehemet  Ali,  and  formed</span><span>  houses  of  agency  at  Suez,  Cairo,  and</span><span>  Alexandria,  and  caravanseras  in  the  de-</span><span>  sert,  having  effected  commercial  relations</span><span>  with  the  Arabs,  ""  the  freebooters  of  the</span><span>  wilderness,  the  descendants  of  Ishmael,""</span><span>  having  expended  a  large  fortune  and  se-</span><span>  riously  injured  his  constitution,  the  gal-</span></p> <p><span>  lant  officer  was  successful.</span></p> <p><span>  The  overland  route  to  India,  as  then</span><span>  established,  was  travelled  in  thirty-four</span><span>  days,  passing  from  Bombay  to  Aden,  from</span><span>  Aden  to  Suez,  from  Suez,  across  the  desert,</span></p> <p><span>  to  Cairo  ;  thence  to  Alexandria,  and,  across</span><span>  the  Mediterranean,  to  Marseilles,  through</span><span>  France  to  Boulogne,  and  on  to  London.</span></p> <p><span>  Charged  from  time  to  time  with  des-</span><span>  patches,  Lieut.  Waghorn  long  maintained</span><span>  the  character  of  the  first  Courier  in  the</span><span>  World.  But  great  as  were  the  advantages</span></p> <p><span>  produced  by  his  exertions,  he  was  far  from</span><span>  satisfied.  ""  Rather  suffered  than  allowed,""</span></p> <p><span>  says  a  late  English  writer,  ""  to  go  through</span><span>  the  French  territory,  impeded  at  best  in-</span><span>  stead  of  being  aided,  and  looked  upon</span><span>  with  suspicion  rather  than  admiration,  he</span><span>  has  felt,  while  he  has  borne  the  intelli-</span><span>  gence  of  England's  victories  in  the  East,</span><span>  and  especially  of  the  subjugation  and</span><span>  ransoms  of  China,  that  he  was  a  messen-</span><span>  ger  of  a  power  which,  whatever  the  jea-</span><span>  lousy  and  malignity  with  which  it  is</span><span>  viewed,  and  however  they  were  increased</span><span>  by  its  recent  triumphs,  ought  no  longer</span><span>  to  be  under  the  humiliating  obligations</span><span>  to  winch  it  has  been  subjected  in  the</span><span>  progress  of  its  despatches  from  its  eastern</span><span>  empire.""</span></p> <p><span>  The  expression  ""  humiliating  obliga-</span><span>  tions""  is  advised.  Arrived  at  Marseilles,</span><span>  the  narrow-minded  jealousy  and  meddle-</span><span>  some  inquisitiveness  of  the  French  Go-</span></p> <p><span>  vernment  had  rendered  it  an  essential</span><span>  condition  of  the  mail's  transit,  that  papers</span><span>  containing  the  gist  of  the  Indian  news</span><span>  should  be  delivered  up  ;  and  of  these  an</span><span>  abstract  was  made,  and  forthwith  des-</span><span>  patched  by  express  to  Paris.  Alive  to  the</span><span>  effects  that  might,  in  an  emergency,  arise</span><span>  from  this  prior  possession  of  the  Indian</span><span>  intelligence,  whatever  its  character  and  im-</span><span>  portance,  and  indignant  at  the  obstructions</span><span>  to  his  progress,  arising  from  the  annoying</span></p> <p><span>  series  of  official  forms  to  which  he  was</span></p> <p><span>  subjected,  Lieut.  Waghorn  resolved,  if</span><span>  possible,  to  get  rid  of  a  system  so  tho-</span><span>  roughly  un-English  by  treading  out  ano-</span><span>  ther  path  from  the  Mediterranean  to  his</span><span>  own  land.  To  his  eagle  eye  it  soon  be-</span><span>  came  apparent  that  by  landing  at  Trieste,</span><span>  in  the  Austrian  territories,  and  travelling</span><span>  direct  to  Ostend,  this  might  be  found,</span><span>  and  a  saving  of  two  hundred  and</span><span>  fifty  miles  might  be  effected,  with-</span><span>  out  even  touching  on  the  possessions</span><span>  of  France.  Receiving  no  encouragement</span><span>  from  his  own  government,  and  having  to</span><span>  allay  the  prejudices  and  to  excite  hopes</span><span>  of  great  ultimate  advantage  in  the  minds</span><span>  of  the  governments  of  other  countries,  he</span><span>  spent  two  years  in  making  the  necessary</span><span>  arrangements.  His  experimental  trip,  by</span><span>  the  new  line  of  route,  in  spite  of  many</span><span>  unlooked-for  obstacles,  was  completely</span><span>  successful.  Landing  at  Dwina,  at  a  short</span><span>  distance  from  Tresta,  he  reached  Inspruck,</span><span>  the  capital  of  the  Tyrol,  in  twenty-seven</span><span>  and  a-half  hours  ;  at  the  same  rapid  rate</span><span>  he  passed  through  Kempten,  Ulm,  Worms;</span><span>  and  Brenstel  ;  thence  by  railway  to  Man</span><span>  heirn.  Here  he  embarked  on  the  Rhine,</span><span>  intending  to  proceed  to  Cologne,  but  the</span><span>  steamer  in  which  he  was,  meeting  with  a</span><span>  disaster  when  off  Bingen,  he  landed</span><span>  on  the  opposite  bank.  The  Prussian  and</span><span>  Belgian  governments  affording  him  every</span><span>  assistance,  he  quickly  reached  Ostend,</span><span>  crossed  the  Channel  to  Dover,  and  arrived</span><span>  in  London  by  railway,  his  entire  journey</span><span>  from  Bombay  occupying  twenty-nine</span><span>  days.  His  subsequent  trips  have  been</span><span>  performed  in  twenty-six  days.</span></p> <p><span>  Shortly  previous  to  the  acceleration  of</span><span>  the  overland  mail,  steam  communication,</span><span>  was  extended  from  Bombay,  by  way  of</span><span>  Ceylon,  to  Sincapore.  The  line  of  steam-</span><span>  ers  having  thus  been  brought  within  4500</span><span>  miles  .of  Sydney,  the  friends  of  the  Aus-</span><span>  tralian  colonies,  in  England,  conceiving</span><span>  that  its  extension  thither  might  be  effected</span><span>  without  any  momentous  expense,  and  with</span><span>  great  resulting  benefit,  drew  the  attention</span><span>  of  Lieut.  Waghorn  to  the  subject.  To</span><span>  shorten  the  communication  between  these</span><span>  great  wool-producing  dependencies,  these</span><span>  wealthy  consumers  of  her  manufactured</span><span>  goods,  from  an  average  of  one  hundred</span><span>  and  ten,  to  sixty  days,  would,  they  readily</span><span>  perceived,  be  to  knit  them  in  a  double</span><span>  bond  of  union  with  the  parent  country.</span><span>  A  meeting  attended  by  many  influential</span><span>  capitalists  and  others  connected  with  the</span><span>  trade  and  interests  of  these  colonies,  was</span><span>  accordingly  held  in  London,  on  the  18th</span><span>  April  last,  to  receive  Mr.  Waghorn's  opi-</span><span>  nion.  He  began  by  observing  that  twenty</span><span>  years  of  his  life  had  been  diligently  em-</span><span>  ployed  in  effecting  steam  communication</span><span>  between  England  and  her  eastern  depen-</span><span>  dencies.  At  present,  a  great  part  of  his</span><span>  object  was  effected.  He  had  therefore</span><span>  confined  himself  to  the  latter  part  of  the</span><span>  route,  and  he  proposed  to  go  by  Sincapore</span><span>  to  Australia.  The  distance  between  the</span><span>  points  was  4,450  miles,  and  the  way</span><span>  which  he  advocated  was  from  Sincapore</span><span>  to  Bally,  from  Bally  to  Port  Essington,</span><span>  thence  to  Wednesday  Island,  and  on  to</span><span>  Port  Jackson,  thus  making  four  stages  of</span><span>  the  distance.  The  government,  he  stated,</span><span>  would  readily  afford  support  to  the  un-</span><span>  dertaking,  as  they  were  anxious  to  esta-.</span><span>  blish  a  steam  navy  in  Australia  ;  but  they</span><span>  approved  alone  of  the  route  he  proposed,</span><span>  believing  that  no  other  was  at  present</span><span>  practicable.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Hon.  Fiancis  Scott,  our  Colonial</span><span>  Agent,  having  moved  the  meeting</span><span>  for  an  expression  of  its  approval  of  the</span><span>  line  suggested  by  Lieut.  Waghorn,  one</span><span>  or  two  persons  present  objected  to  the</span><span>  route  via  Singapore,  and  commended  that</span><span>  by  Panama.  Sir  George  Larpent,  the</span><span>  chairman,  in  order  to  preserve  unanimity,</span><span>  altered  the  motion  to  the  effect  that  the</span><span>  meeting  highly  approved  of  the  establish-</span><span>  ment  of  steam  communication  with  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  ;  and  in  its  amended  state  it  was</span><span>  carried  without  dissent.  A  committee</span><span>  was  then  appointed  to  take  measures  for</span><span>  establishing  the  line,  and  to  obtain  such</span><span>  assistance  as  the  government  might  be</span><span>  willing  to  render.</span></p> <p><span>  Following  this,  we  are  glad  to  observe</span><span>  that  a  meeting  of  many  of  our  leading</span><span>  mercantile  men  was  held  in  Sydney  on</span><span>  the  27th  ultimo  ;  to  adopt  an  address  to</span><span>  His  Excellency  the  Governor  and  a  me-</span><span>  morial  to  the  Legislative  Council,  praying</span><span>  for  their  co-operation  in  the  establishment</span><span>  of  steam  communication  between  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  and  Great  Britain.</span></p> <p><span>  The  line  proposed  by  Lient.  Waghorn</span><span>  needs,  we  believe,  but  little  alteration  to</span><span>  become  the  best  that  could  be  devised.</span><span>  Wednesday  Island,  wanting  hands  to</span><span>  work  its  coal,  unfitted  for  a  port  of  refit</span><span>  and  supply,  could  not  answer  the  end  de-</span><span>  signed  without  a  vast  expense.  This</span><span>  error,  however,  practice  would  soon  re-</span><span>  medy.  Moreton  Bay,  possessing  as  it</span><span>  does  every  requisite-capable  of  supplying</span><span>  provisions,  coal,  spars,  and  the  means  of</span><span>  repair,  in  case  of  disaster,  lying,  too,  in</span><span>  the  direct  track  to  Port  Jackson,  offers</span><span>  claims  to  be  numbered  amongst  the  stop-</span><span>  ping-places,  that  cannot  be  overlooked.</span><span>  It  might,  indeed,  with  advantage,  be  made</span><span>  the  port  of  final  destination  ;  a  crack</span><span>  steamer  being  specially  retained  to  carry</span><span>  on  the  mail  to  Sydney,  the  Sincapore</span></p> <p><span>  vessel  would  have  abundant  time  to  refit</span></p> <p><span>  and  prepare  here  for  sea  before  receiving</span><span>  the  return  mail.</span></p> <p><span>  Who  can  rightly  determine  the  degree</span><span>  of  influence  which  the  projected  line  must</span><span>  have  upon  Brisbane's  welfare  ?  From  a</span><span>  distant  dependency,  far  removed  from  the</span><span>  track  of  British  ships,  it  will,  in  the  order</span><span>  of  communication,  be  brought  nearer  to</span><span>  England  than  any  other  commercial  set-</span><span>  tlement  in  Australia.  Its  short  and  genial</span><span>  winter,  delightful  spring  and  autumn,  and</span><span>  temperate  summer-devoid  of  the  sudden</span><span>  variations  which  usually  form  the  greatest</span></p> <p><span>  drawback  to  Australian  climature-must</span></p> <p><span>  offer  paramount  inducements  to  the  shat-</span><span>  tered  constitution  of  the  Anglo-Indian.</span><span>  Its  trade  direct  to  and  fro,  its  communi-</span><span>  cations  with  England  by  the  new  route</span><span>  occupying  not  more  than  fifty-six  days</span><span>  having  intercourse  with  Sydney  only  as</span><span>  the  seat  of  government  :  all  which  will</span><span>  be  the  events  of  a  few  years  :  the  conse-</span><span>  quent  enhancement  of  its  commercial</span><span>  and  social  importance  is  well  nigh  incal-</span></p> <p><span>  culable.</span></p> <p><span>  *  In  his  speech  Mr  Scott  did  ample  justice  to</span><span>  the  importance  of  the  Australian  colonies.  ""  He</span><span>  would  not  hesitate  to  assert,""  he  said,  ""  that  the</span><span>  boundless  plains  of  Australia  would  be  productive</span><span>  of  far  greater  wealth  than  the  mines  of  Mexico</span><span>  and  Peru.  He  believed  that  the  difference  between</span><span>  the  value  of  the  trade  with  foreign  countries  and</span><span>  that  with  the  colonies  was  but  little  known,  and</span><span>  he  would,  therefore,  take  the  opportunity  of  con-</span><span>  trasting  the  value  of  those  several  trades  now</span><span>  earned  on  with  countries  comprising  one  fourth</span><span>  of  the  population  of  the  globe-a  population,  in-</span><span>  deed,  not  less  than  160,000,000.  He  found,  then,</span><span>  Prussia  took  6d.  a  head  of  our  goods  and  manu-</span><span>  factures  ;  the  countless  millions  of  Russia  took</span><span>  8d.  a  head  ;  France,  1s.  5d.  a  head  ;  the  United</span><span>  States  of  Germany,  3s.  10d  ;  and  the  United</span><span>  States  of  America  now  took  5s.  8d.  a  head  ;  but</span><span>  he  should  observe  that,  before  the  United  States</span><span>  ceased  to  be  a  colony  of  this  country,  it  took  £1</span><span>  a  head.  But  what  was  the  case  with  the  colonies  ?</span><span>  Why,  Canada  takes  £L  15s.  a  head,  the  West  In-</span><span>  dies  take  £2  17s.  6d.  a  head,  and  at  one  time  New</span><span>  Sonth  Wales  took  £10  a  head,  though  now  it  had</span><span>  declined  to  £7  10s.  ;  and  the  whole  average  of  the</span><span>  consumption  of  the  colonies  was  £1  14s.  6d.  a</span><span>  head  ;  and  he  found  that  this  country  absolutely</span><span>  furnished,  on  an  average,  as  much  as  1s.  a  head</span><span>  to  every  inhabitant  of  the  globe.  In  1840  -the</span><span>  Australian  colonies  took  as  much  as  £2,630,000</span><span>  worth  of  the  produce  and  manufactures  of  this</span><span>  country  ;  while,  from  all  the  world  beside,  they</span><span>  took  only  £385,000  among  a  population  of</span><span>  1,300,000.  On  an  average  of  the  last  five  years</span><span>  the  number  of  ships  inwards  was  605,  with  a</span><span>  tonnage  of  141,000,  and  of  those  cleared  out</span><span>  wards  was  130,000  ;  though  during  the  last  year,</span><span>  these  numbers  declined  respectively,  to  417  ships</span><span>  inwards,  with  a  tonnage  of  87,000,  and  569  ships</span><span>  outwards,  with  a  tonnage  of  109,000.  On  an</span><span>  average  of  the  last  five  years  the  imports  had</span><span>  been  £1,895,000,  although  last  year  they  had</span><span>  declined  to  £931,000.  The  exports,  during  the</span><span>  same  period,  had  been  £  1,158,000,  but  last  year</span><span>  £1,223,000,  giving  employment,  one  way  or</span><span>  the  other,  to  upwards  of  3,000,000  of  indi-</span><span>  viduals.  During  the  year  1844  no  less  than</span><span>  13,500,000  lbs.  of  wool  had  been  imported  into</span><span>  England  alone.""</span></p> ",Article,1846-09-19,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

The  man  of  appre-</span><span>  hensive  mind,  who  sees  a  highwayman  in</span><span>  every  bush,  excites  our  pity  and  contempt</span><span>  The  Company  that,  with  full  coffers,  hesi-</span><span>  tates  to  introduce  a  Bank  into  Brisbane,</span><span>  until  some  keener  and  more  adventurous</span><span>  rival  set  it  the  example,  will  certainly</span><span>  have  forfeited  all  claims  to  our  confidence</span><span>  and  support.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  lately  witnessed  so  much  em-</span></p> <p><span>  barrassment  and  loss  from  the  want  of  a</span></p> <p><span>  local  Bank-evils,  which  are  every  day</span><span>  augmenting-that  we  cannot  avoid  re-</span></p> <p><span>  curring  to  the  subject.  In  inviting  the</span><span>  attention  of  the  Colonial  Banking  Com-</span><span>  panies  to  the  fitness  of  Brisbane  to  sup-</span><span>  port  sucn  an  Institution,  this  community</span><span>  seek  no  one-sided  bargain  ;  for  a  banking</span><span>  capital,  if  judiciously  managed,  would</span><span>  yield  as  high  a  rate  of  remuneration  in</span></p> <p><span>  this,  as  in  any  other  part  of  New  South</span><span>  Wales.  This  is  capable  of  demonstration.</span><span>  The  expense  of  a  branch  Bank  in  Brisbane</span></p> <p><span>  would  be-say  :-</span></p> <p><span>  Cashier  and  Managing  Director..  £300</span></p> <p><span>  Clerk.........100</span><span>  House  rent........  50</span></p> <p><span>  Stationery,  postage,  &c.......  50</span></p> <p><span>  Five  hundred  pounds  in  all.  The  gross</span><span>  transactions  falling  within  the  scope  of  a</span><span>  Bank  during  the  ensuing  twelve  months,</span><span>  would  probably  amount  to  £120,000  ;</span><span>  for  this  a  circulating  medium  of  £6,000</span><span>  would  amply  suffice.  This  medium  or</span><span>  currency  might  consist  of  notes,  -with  a</span><span>  small  part,  say  £500,  in  coin.  The  notes</span><span>  would  of  course  be  based  on  the  ascer-</span><span>  tained  stability  of  the  parent  Bank,  and</span><span>  we  would  possess  a  safeguard  against  their</span><span>  excessive  issue  by  being  enabled  to  pro-</span></p> <p><span>  cure  in  lieu  of  them  bills  on  Sydney  or</span><span>  England.  Coin,  indeed,  would  be  scarcely</span><span>  required.  Our  colonial  system  of  banking</span><span>  resembling  the  system  that  has  been  so</span><span>  successfully  acted  upon  in  Scotland,  it</span><span>  would  be  no  deviation  from  its  principles</span><span>  if  notes  issued  by  our  local  Bank  were,</span><span>  based,  not  on  so  much  coin  within  its</span><span>  strong  box,  but  on  the  credit  and  stability</span><span>  of  the  shareholders.

The  Union  Bank,  one  of</span></p> <p><span>  our  great  Anglo-Colonial  Institutions,  has,</span><span>  as  our  readers  are  aware,  recently  extended</span><span>  a  branch  to  Portland-a  town  of  not  more</span><span>  than  half  the  importance  of  Brisbane,  and</span><span>  with  a  district  behind  it  very  limited.</span><span>  And  why  has  the  Union  done  this  ?</span><span>  Simply  because  the  good  people  of  Port-</span><span>  land  had  acted  energetically  and  sen-</span><span>  sibly.  Recognising  the  simple,  self</span><span>  evident  fact,  that  the  wealth  and  position</span><span>  of  any  of  the  more  recently  occupied  dis-</span><span>  tricts  of  the  colony  can  at  no  period  be</span><span>  ascertained  save  by  actual  inspection</span><span>  that  their  onward  progress  is  so  rapid  as</span><span>  to  forbid  the  experience  of  one  year  form-</span><span>  ing  a  criterion  by  which  to  judge  of  their</span><span>  position  and  claims  even  in  the  year</span><span>  succeeding-the  Portlandites  put  their</span><span>  shoulders  to  the  wheel  :  they  desisted</span><span>  from  their  exertions  to  obtain  a  Bank</span><span>  only  when  arrangements  were  being  made</span></p> <p><span>  for  its  establishment.</span></p> <p><span>  Let  us,  therefore,  bear  this  in  mind.</span><span>  Let  those  amongst  us,  who,  from  oppor-</span><span>  tunity  and  ability  are  best  fitted  for  the</span><span>  task,  leave  no  stone  unturned  to  secure  a</span><span>  boon  coveted  by  all  classes  of  this  com-</span><span>  munity.</span></p> <p><span>  UNDER  the  head  of  ""  Management  of  the</span><span>  Waste  Lands,""  an  able  letter  appears  in  a</span><span>  recent  number  of  the  Port  Phillip  Herald,</span><span>  written  by  Mr.  Colin  Campbell,  a  stock-</span><span>  holder  in  the  district  of  Geelong.  The</span><span>  colonial  public  generally  are  indebted  for</span><span>  the  publication  of  the  clear  and  compre-</span></p> <p><span>  hensive  views  which  the  writer  has  formed</span><span>  upon  this  highly  important  question.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Campbell  commences  by  laying</span><span>  down  the  broad  proposition,  that  the  Waste</span><span>  Lands  of  the  colony  do  not  belong  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  Crown  in  the  same  sense  as  the  lands  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  Duke  of  Devonshire  belong  to  him-</span><span>  that  they  are  not  the  private  property  of</span><span>  British  royalty,  acting  through  its  repre-</span><span>  sentative  here,  independently  of  the  Lords</span><span>  and  Commons  who  represent  the  people  of</span><span>  England,  and  of  our  Legislative  Assembly,</span><span>  who  represent  the  people  of  this  colony.</span><span>  Since  a  fund  has  been  derived  from  these</span><span>  lands,  no  part  of  it  has  been  applied  to</span><span>  the  purposes  of  the  British  Crown,  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  strict  sense  of  the  word.  It  has  been</span><span>  wholly  expended  upon  the  colony  itself,</span><span>  in  the  shape  of  improvements  and  immi-</span><span>  gration.</span></p> <p><span>  Nor  are  the  Waste  Lands  subject  to  the</span><span>  jurisdiction  of  the  Crown  in  virtue  of  its</span><span>  prerogative.  If  they  were,  why  require  the</span><span>  interference  of  the  British  Parliament,  as</span><span>  in  the  case  of  Lord  Stanley's  Act  and  Mr.</span><span>  Hope's  new  Bill  ?</span></p> <p><span>  In  order  that  concord  may  subsist  be-</span><span>  tween  the  Crown  ad  the  people,  neither</span><span>  should  have  independent  interests  or  pos-</span><span>  sessions  which  might  be  turned  into</span><span>  means  of  mutual  oppression.  If  the</span><span>  Crown  in  itself  made  private  acquisitions</span><span>  to  any  extent,  the  consequences  might  be</span><span>  dangerous  to  liberty.  If,  in  our  case,</span><span>  Crown  Lands,  so  called,  were  strictly  the</span><span>  property  of  the  Sovereign,  the  anomaly</span><span>  would  arise  of  a  portion  of  the  British</span><span>  people  being  under  the  jurisdiction  of</span><span>  what  is  only  one  branch  of  the  Imperial</span><span>  Legislature.  A  principle  embracing  such</span><span>  a  state  of  things,  so  adverse  to  the  consti-</span><span>  tution  and  law  of  England,  Sir  George</span><span>  Gipps  endeavoured  to  maintain.  He</span><span>  persisted  in  asserting  that  although</span><span>  the  lands  of  England  have  passed  out  of</span><span>  the  hands  of  the  Sovereign-yet  the  lands</span><span>  </span><span>  Majesty  is  in  the  position  of  William  the</span><span>  Conqueror  before  he  parcelled  out  Eng-</span></p> <p><span>  land  to  his  followers.  But,  although</span><span>  subjects  of  the  British  Crown,  we  are</span><span>  not  utterly  dependent  upon  it,  for</span><span>  the  constitution  and  law  of  England</span><span>  are  as  binding  on  the  prince  as  on</span><span>  the  peasant  -  in  fact,  property  in  land</span><span>  is  only  stated  to  derive  its  origin</span><span>  from  the  Crown,  because  it  must  have</span><span>  some  source  and  the  Crown  is  the  key-</span><span>  stone  of  the  great  constitutional  ediface.</span><span>  We  are  part  and  parcel  of  the  British</span><span>  people,  and  should  be  subject  to  the  same</span></p> <p><span>  principles  as  those  on  which  England  is</span></p> <p><span>  ruled.</span></p> <p><span>  But  the  fact  is,  (says  Mr.  Campbell),  there  are</span><span>  lands  here  held  in  private  by  no  one,  but  ad-</span><span>  ministered  by  the  Governor  here,  and  by  the</span><span>  Colonial  Secretary  to  the  British  Parliament  at</span><span>  home,  without  any  acknowledged  and  consistent</span><span>  principle.  We  are  justified  however,  in  holding</span><span>  that  they  are  held  by  the  Crown,  acting  for  the</span><span>  people,  for  all  their  acts  are  supposed  to  be  for  the</span><span>  people.  We  are  justified,  also,  in  claiming  the</span><span>  application  of  the  same  principles  to  ourselves  as</span><span>  are  established  at  home,  and  the  English  Parlia-</span><span>  ment  not  only  takes  under  its  special  charge  the</span><span>  management  of  the  public  property  and  its  pro-</span><span>  ceeds  in  revenue,  but  they  also  take  a  paternal</span><span>  interest  in  the  administration  of  Crown  lands.</span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  The  grand  principle  involved  is,  that  the  property</span></p> <p><span>  of  a  people  resides  in  itself  ;  on  this  ground</span><span>  every  question  where  money  is  involved  is  pecu-</span><span>  liarly,  under  the  control  of  the  representatives  of</span><span>  the  country.  But  if  this  principle  is  to  be  co-</span><span>  extensive  with  the  empire,  and  if  a  representative</span></p> <p><span>  assembly  has  been  granted  to  New  South  Wales,</span><span>  why  should  not  that  assembly  hold  the  same  rela-</span><span>  tive  position  here  to  the  Governor-as  Parliament</span><span>  does  in  England  to  the  Sovereign?</span></p> <p><span>  But  the  most  difficult  part  of  the  question  now</span><span>  comes,  viz.  :-Are  these  Crown  lands  to  be  con-</span><span>  sidered  imperial  or  colonial  property  ?  Although</span></p> <p><span>  unalienatcd  the  reventue  derived  from  them  has</span><span>  been  given  up  to  the  exclusive  benefit  of  the</span><span>  colony  itself,  for  England  learnt  too  severe  a</span><span>  lesson  in  her  struggle  with  America  again  to  as-</span><span>  sume  the  use  of  what  her  children  had  acquired  in</span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  other  parts  of  the  world.  Can  this  revenue  be</span><span>  conceded,  and  yet  the  source  of  it  be  reserved  ?</span><span>  Can  the  parent  expect  at  mature  years  to  enjoy</span><span>  the  prospective  youth  and  vigour  of  his  child  ?</span><span>  And  ought  a  colony,  deprived  of  the  immediate</span><span>  resources  of  the  mother  country,  to  be  deprived</span></p> <p><span>  also  of  the  new  inheritance  which  it  has  made  for</span></p> <p><span>  itself  ?  Shall  the  anomaly  exist  of  the  colonial</span><span>  lands  being  subject  to  a  popular  as  well  as  regal</span><span>  jurisdiction  at  home,  and  yet  being  excluded  from</span><span>  the  control  of  the  people  of  the  colony  itself</span><span>  through  their  representatives  ?  The  functions  of</span><span>  royalty  may  be  delegated  far  more  easily  than</span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  those  of  a  deliberative  assembly,  whose  province  is</span><span>  to  form  a  judgment  ater  free  discussion.  And</span><span>  can  a  small  place  like  this  expect  its  local  interests</span><span>  to  be  discussed  with  zeal  and  attention  by  an</span></p> <p><span>  English  Parliament,  in  whose  eyes  we  are  com-</span></p> <p><span>  paratively  a  cipher  ?  But  what  is  little  to  them,</span><span>  to  us  is  everything.</span></p> <p><span>  The  great  principle  of  British  freedom  in  that</span><span>  there  shall  be  no  taxation  without  representation</span><span>  -and  if  this  applies  to  the  proceeds  of  public</span><span>  wealth,  it  must  equally  apply  to  the  public  wealth</span><span>  itself.  If  England  claims  in  her  imperial  capacity</span><span>  the  property  in  Waste  Lands  here,  she  has  a  right</span><span>  to  apply  to  imperial  purposes  the  income  which</span><span>  they  yield  to  the  produce  of  their  sales.  Will  she</span><span>  venture  to  do  so  ?  Can  we  be  represented  there</span><span>  at  a  distance  of  half  the  circuit  of  the  globe  ?</span></p> <p><span>  The  deductions  then  which  I  would  make  from</span><span>  these  premises  is,  that  the  Waste  Lands  of  New</span><span>  South  Wales  belong  to  the  colony  itself  as  a  floating</span><span>  capital  ;  that  they  cannot  be  managed  consistently</span><span>  with  English  principles  except  under  the  control</span><span>  of  the  representatives  of  the  people  in  the  colony  ;</span><span>  and  that  thus  the  British  empire  will  receive  most</span><span>  benefit,  for  they  will  be  made  more  valuable  and</span><span>  more  productive  under  local,  than  under  distant</span><span>  management;  and  if  the  colony  be  treated  as</span><span>  part  and  parcel  of  the  empire,  its  prosperity  can-</span><span>  not  fail  to  be  communicated  to  every  other  part</span><span>  of  the  common  system.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  limited  sheet  precludes  our  notic-</span><span>  ing,  for  the  present,  the  concluding  por-</span><span>  tion  of  this  letter.  It  contains  an  exposi-</span><span>  tion  of  the  actual  position  of  the  squatters,</span><span>  and  the  rights  withheld  from  them.  The</span><span>  writer  suggests  that  ""  a  key  to  this</span><span>  puzzling  question  ''-i.e.,  the  judicious  and</span><span>  permanent  regulation  of  the  squatting</span><span>  lands-will  be  found  in  the  Constitution  ;</span><span>  and  asserts  that  a  departure  from  its  prin-</span><span>  ciples  has  kept  the  colony  in  ""  a  turmoil</span><span>  of  uncertainties  ;""  and  that  a  return  to</span><span>  them  will  surely  restore  the  colony  ""  to</span><span>  that  order  and  security  which  they  are  the</span><span>  means  of  maintaining  throughout  an</span><span>  empire.""

"<p><span>  To  the  Editor  of  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SIR,—I  perceive  in  your  last  number  an  article</span><span>  headed  “Sly  Grog  Selling,”  in  which  Mr.  Con-</span></p> <p><span>  stable  Higgins  figures  very  considerably.

"<p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  AUGUST  15,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  Improvements  in  penal  science—the  best</span><span>  means  of  reforming  her  criminals,  must</span><span>  ever  form  a  moot-point  in  England's  po-</span><span>  lity.  Human  nature,  human  frailties,</span></p> <p><span>  preclude  any  defined,  abstract  system,</span><span>  which  will  alike  apply  and  succeed  in</span><span>  every  phase  and  condition  of  society.  In</span><span>  the  body  politic,  as  in  the  body  corporate,</span><span>  the  best  physician  is  he  who  aims  at  pre-</span><span>  vention  rather  than  cure—who  seeks  not</span><span>  so  much  to  magnify  the  terrors  of  the</span><span>  law,  as  to  elevate  the  character  of  the</span><span>  people.  The  schoolmaster  must,  in  truth,</span><span>  occupy  that  place  in  the  estimation  of  the</span><span>  state  which  is  too  often  assigned  to  mere</span><span>  physical  instruments  ;  harsh  and  cruel</span><span>  legislation,  which  by  brutalising  educes</span><span>  greater  ills  than  it  avails  to  check,  nor</span><span>  dungeons,  nor  the  lash,  arrest  the  progress</span><span>  of  crime  half  as  successfully  as  the  sim-</span><span>  ple  and  easy  elevation  of  the  public  mind.</span></p> <p><span>  An  attentive  perusal  of  the  volumious,</span><span>  correspondence  that  has  taken  place  on</span><span>  the  subject  of  the  contemplated  Colony</span><span>  in  Northern  Australia,  between  Sir  James</span><span>  Graham,  the  Treasury  Board,  the  Governor</span><span>  of  Diemen's  Land,  and  the  ex-Secretary</span><span>  for  the  Colonies,  Lord  Stanley,  has  left</span><span>  us  hesitating  between  two  opinions.  We</span><span>  know  not  whether  to  assign  to  the  noble</span><span>  Lord  the  honor  due  to  a  high-minded</span><span>  philanthropist,  ardently  intent  upon  add-</span><span>  ing  to  existent  inducements  to  repentance,</span><span>  upon  affording  increased  opportunities  of</span><span>  retrieval  of  his  position,  to  erring  man</span><span>  or  to  stigmatise  him  as  a  keen  financier,</span><span>  to  whom  promises  are  bootless,  covenants</span><span>  are  as  straws,  when  they  stand  in  the</span><span>  way  of  economical  reduction.  The  arbi-</span><span>  trary,  self-willed,  capricious  spirit  that</span><span>  occasionally  evinces  itself  in  his  despatches</span><span>  to  Sir  Eardley  Wilmot-his  cool  enun-</span><span>  ciation  of  propositions  which  reveal</span><span>  the  haughty  stickler  for  prerogative,  ""  THE</span><span>  RIGHTS  OF  THE  CROWN,""  and  which  could</span><span>  only  be  conceived  by  one  in  his  nature</span><span>  essentially  a  tyrant—must,  we  fear,  bear</span><span>  us  out  in  asserting  that  if  good  result</span><span>  from  the  formation  of  the  contemplated</span><span>  colony,  it  must  be  taken  rather  as  the  in-</span><span>  cident  than  as  among  the  coveted  objects</span><span>  of  Stanley's  policy.</span></p> <p><span>  The  formation  of  the  new  settlement  is</span></p> <p><span>  the  natural  sequel  of  the  great  penal</span><span>  scheme,  which  has  obtained  in  Van  Die-</span><span>  men's  Land  since  the  month  of  November</span></p> <p><span>  1842,  known  as  the  Probation  System,</span><span>  and  which  in  a  great  measure  owes  its</span><span>  origin  to  the  noble  Lord—a  scheme  which,</span><span>  however  successful  as  a  preliminary  mea-</span><span>  sure,  or  superior  to  the  assignment  system</span><span>  which  preceded  it,  is  yet  of  itself  insuffi-</span><span>  cient  for  the  great  end  designed,  and  in-</span><span>  competent  to  replace  the  convict  in  the</span><span>  full  possession  of  those  social  rights  which</span><span>  he  had  forfeited  by  his  crimes.  Its  leading</span><span>  principles*  are,  sound  religious  and  secu-</span><span>  lar  instruction,  strict  seclusion,  rigid  dis-</span><span>  cipline,  and  transition  punishments  of  a</span><span>  nature  and  for  a  period  to  be  determined</span><span>  by  the  convict's  own  good  conduct.</span><span>  Classes,  consisting  we  believe  of  six  in-</span><span>  dividuals,  are  formed  ;  and  in  order  to</span><span>  create  that  sense  of  mutual  responsibility</span><span>  requisite  to  induce  habits  of  mutual  su-</span><span>  perintendence,  every  member  is  held  ame-</span><span>  nable  not  only  for  his  own  acts  but  also</span><span>  for  the  acts  of  his  class-fellows.  In  pro-</span><span>  portion  to  the  behaviour  of  the  whole</span><span>  class  is  the  probatory  period  under-</span><span>  gone  ere  its  members  are  emancipated,</span><span>  and  eligible  for  private  service.  And</span><span>  when  emancipated,  the  government  stipu-</span><span>  late  on  their  behalf  that  their  wages  shall</span><span>  not  be  less  than  suffice  for  a  comfortable</span><span>  subsistence.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Probation  System  would,  without</span><span>  doubt,  have  worked  well  and  satisfactorily,</span></p> <p><span>  •  Lord  Stanley  classes  these  principles  under</span><span>  six  heads.  1st.  The  necessity  of  preliminary  se-</span><span>  clusion.  2nd.  A  graduated  scale  of  punishments,</span><span>  decreasing  in  severity.  3rd.  Such  transition  of</span><span>  punishment  to  depend  on  the  behaviour  of  the</span><span>  convict.  4th.  The  reward  of  all  good  behaviour,</span><span>  by  immediate  relaxation  of  punishment,  and  the</span><span>  more  ready  admission  of  his  claims  to  pardon.</span><span>  5th.  That  each  convict's  claim  to  indulgence  or</span><span>  pardon  shall  be  estimated  by  a  record  of  his</span><span>  course  and  habits  of  life  reduced  to  numerical</span><span>  notation.  6th.  The  subjecting  of  every  convict,</span><span>  from  the  commencement  to  the  close  of  his  pro-</span><span>  bationary  career,  to  a  systematic  course  of  reli-</span><span>  gious,  moral,  and  industrial  education.</span></p> <p><span>  had  not  a  state  of  things  occurred  which</span><span>  could  not  have  been  foreseen,  and  which</span><span>  unfortunately  opposed  serious  obstacles  to</span><span>  its  success.  We  allude  to  the  late  com-</span><span>  mercial  crisis.  Credit  sank  to  a  low  ebb,</span><span>  commerce  diminished,  enterprise  was  for</span><span>  the  time  annihilated,  and  the  energies  of</span><span>  the  colonists  were  drooping  and  depressed.</span><span>  While  the  capital  of  the  country  and  the</span><span>  field  for  its  employment  diminished,  prison</span><span>  labour  was  poured  into  the  island  in</span><span>  excess.  The  operations  of  capital  and</span><span>  industry  being  narrowed  within  certain</span><span>  limits,  redundant  labour  only  served  to</span><span>  increase  competition,  and,  without  en-</span><span>  larging  the  market,  to  reduce  price.</span><span>  Scarce  and  dear  labour  had  previously</span><span>  accompanied  high  prosperity,  and  now,  in</span><span>  remarkable  contrast,  cheap  labour  and</span><span>  improved  means  of  access  and  transit  be</span><span>  came  co-existent  with  acute  general  dis-</span><span>  tress.  Withal,  too,  many  of  the  idle  and</span></p> <p><span>  dissolute  were  without  employment,  and</span><span>  reduced  to  plunder  in  order  to  subsist.</span><span>  Crime,  and  consequent  insecurity  of</span><span>  life  and  property,  augmented.  As  might</span><span>  have  been  expected,  therefore,  in  such  an</span><span>  untoward  state  of  things,  every  ill  that</span><span>  colonial  ""  flesh  was  heir  to,""  was  stigma-</span><span>  tised  as  resulting  from  the  penal  scheme</span><span>  of  Lord  Stanley.</span></p> <p><span>  So  long  as  the  farmers  of  Van  Diemen's</span><span>  Land  obtained  ten,  fifteen,  or  twenty  shil-</span><span>  lings  a  bushel  for  their  wheat,  so  long  as</span></p> <p><span>  its  stockholders  sold  toothless  ewes  at</span></p> <p><span>  twenty-five  shillings  a-head,  and  its</span><span>  merchants  enjoyed  an  extensive  and  pro-</span><span>  fitable  monopoly  of  trade—so  long  as  the</span><span>  island  was  the  granary  of  Australasia,</span><span>  and  South  Australia  and  Port  Phillip</span><span>  eagerly  purchased  its  surplus  live  stock,</span><span>  transportation  did  not  excite  even  a  soli-</span><span>  tary  murmur.  But  when  those  great  con-</span><span>  sumers  became  producers,  when  they  not</span><span>  only  virtually  shut  out  the  sister  colony</span><span>  from  their  own  markets,  but  undersold  her</span><span>  in  her  own-when  the  Southern  Austra-</span></p> <p><span>  lians,  instead  of  buying  her  wheat  at  ten</span><span>  shillings,  offered  to  sell  grain  equally  good</span><span>  at  half-a-crown—when  fat  sheep  could  be</span><span>  purchased  at  Port  Phillip  for  one-fourth</span><span>  of  the  price  formerly  paid  for  her  own</span><span>  lean,  scabby  crawlers,  grievances  were  dis-</span><span>  covered  where  none  were  before  supposed</span><span>  to  exist  ;  and  as  the  manufacturers  of</span><span>  England  have  been  but  too  prone  to  stig-</span><span>  matise  Corn-law  protection  as  an  unmiti-</span><span>  gated  evil,  so  did  the  Van  Diemonians</span><span>  trace  all  their  ills  to  transportation.</span></p> <p><span>  Far  therefore  be  it  from  us  to  assert</span></p> <p><span>  that  the  Probation  System  has  failed,  or</span><span>  that,  under  other  and  more  favorable  cir-</span><span>  cumstances,  it  might  not  have  proved  the</span><span>  most  efficient  reformatory  scheme  that  ever</span><span>  emanated  from  an  English  Minister.  But</span></p> <p><span>  to  enable  it  to  realise  the  views  of  its</span><span>  framer,  and  to  ensure  its  success,  it  was</span><span>  requisite  that  the  colony  should  be  able</span><span>  to  find  private  employment  for  as  many</span><span>  convicts  as  were  likely  to  become  free  for</span><span>  years  to  come.  To  its  inability  to  do</span><span>  this,  may  be  ascribed  the  overthrow</span><span>  of  his  calculations,  Of  the  classes</span><span>  who  obtained  remission  of  punishment,</span><span>  few  were  able  to  support  themselves  ;  and</span><span>  even  of  these  a  great  proportion  were  con-</span><span>  tinually  falling  back  on  the  Government</span><span>  for  necessary  subsistence—a  proportion</span><span>  augmented  by  every  fresh  importation  of</span><span>  prisoners.  Listless  dependence  on  the  pub-</span><span>  lic  purse,  habits  of  indolence  and  apathy</span><span>  were  induced  ;  the  efficacy  of  pardons,  or  of</span><span>  relaxations  of  punishment  as  incentives  to</span><span>  good  conduct  were  impaired  ;  and  a  mass</span><span>  of  persons  of  every  variety  of  character</span><span>  and  capacity,  and  of  good  and  ill  desert,</span><span>  were  reduced  to  one  general  level,  and</span><span>  were  compelled  to  associate  as  fellow  work-</span><span>  men  in  the  same  pursuits  :  the  best  exposed</span><span>  to  the  contaminating  influence  of  the  very</span><span>  worst.  In  order  to  remedy  evils  so  se-</span><span>  rious,  convicts  conditionally  pardoned  were</span><span>  allowed,  by  an  order  dated  February,</span><span>  1845,  to  seek  hire  in  the  neighbouring</span><span>  colonies.  But  the  additional  demand  thus</span><span>  created  for  their  services  was,  in  the  first</span><span>  instance,  exceedingly  small.  How  to  de-</span><span>  vise  employment  for  the  increasing  surplus</span><span>  labour,  of  a  nature  suitable  to  the  eman-</span><span>  cipist,  economical  to  the  government,  and</span><span>  best  promotive  of  the  interests  of  the</span><span>  Empire,  became  a  matter  of  serious  con-</span></p> <p><span>  sideration.</span></p> <p><span>  At  this  juncture  a  plan  of  colonising</span><span>  North  Australia,  which  we  believe  origi-</span><span>  nated  in  a  suggestion  of  Dr.  Lang  to  a</span><span>  Committee  of  the  House  of  Commons,  in</span><span>  1837,  and  which  was  subsequently  recom-</span></p> <p><span>  mended  by  Sir  Richard  Bourke  in  a  dis-</span><span>  patch  of  the  25th  October,  1838,  and</span><span>  frequently  adverted  to  as  a  practicable</span><span>  scheme  by  other  witnesses,  was  revived.</span><span>  It  at  once  received  the  favourable  con-</span><span>  sideration  of  Lord  Stanley.  No  other  way</span><span>  of  escape  seemed  open,  from  the  difficul-</span><span>  ties  that  surrounded  the  question,  While</span><span>  on  the  one  hand  a  large  number  of  eman-</span></p> <p><span>  cipated  convicts  were  thrown  for  support</span><span>  upon  the  government  in  Van  Diemen's</span><span>  Land,  on  the  other,  the  home  government</span><span>  were  pledged  not  to  renew  transportation</span><span>  to  New  South  Wales.  A  colony  in  North</span><span>  Australia  therefore  offered  an  easy  and</span><span>  safe  solution  of  the  difficulty—and  opened</span><span>  up  another  and  more  certain  outlet  through</span><span>  which  the  labour  of  a  dependent  and  worse</span><span>  than  unproductive  population  might  be</span><span>  turned  to  profitable  account.  The  northern</span><span>  boundary  of  this  colony  was  permanently</span><span>  fixed  at  26°  south  latitude,  and  a  new</span><span>  colony  planned  which  should  extend  from</span><span>  thence  to  Cape  York,  about  10°  40'  S.,</span><span>  and  run  westward  to  141°  east  longitude,</span><span>  which  latter  also  forms  the  western  boun-</span></p> <p><span>  dary  of  New  South  Wales.  This,  our</span><span>  readers  are  aware,  includes  the  mag-</span><span>  nificent  discoveries  of  Leichhardt.</span></p> <p><span>  Northern  Australia  is  not  to  become</span><span>  a  model  colony.  For  some  years  after  its</span><span>  formation  it  cannot  advance  beyond  the</span><span>  state  of  a  labour  depot  from  which  em-</span><span>  ployers  may  draw  as  many  hands  as  they</span><span>  please.  So  long  indeed  as  they  maintain,</span><span>  as  servants,  the  emancipated  convicts,  at-</span><span>  tempts  to  people  the  new  settlement  will</span><span>  not  be  made.  Its  formation,  however,</span><span>  will  supply  an  effectual  check  to  the</span><span>  spirit  of  listless  dependence  on  the  go-</span><span>  vernment  into  which  many  of  these  latter</span><span>  too  readily  fall.  To  every  such  person</span><span>  will  be  tendered  the  alternative  of  finding</span><span>  an  honest  subsistence  elsewhere,  or  of</span><span>  migrating  to  a  colony  where  an  easy  main-</span><span>  tenance  will  be  placed  within  his  reach.</span></p> <p><span>  The  classes  of  persons  of  which  the</span><span>  population  of  Northern  Australia  will  in</span><span>  the  first  instance  consist,  will  be  1st,  offi-</span><span>  cials,  a  detachment  of  troops,  and  a  branch</span><span>  of  the  Customs  ;  2nd,  convicts  who  have</span><span>  passed  a  probatory  period  at  Penton-</span><span>  ville  ;  3rd,  the  unemployed  emancipists</span><span>  of  Van  Diemen's  Land  ;  and  4th,  a  large</span><span>  portion,  if  not  the  whole,  of  the  female</span><span>  convicts  sent  from  Great  Britain.  The</span><span>  sending  out  of  convicts'  wives  and  chil-</span><span>  dren  will  also,  it  is  anticipated,  be  a</span><span>  measure  often  resorted  to  by  Poor  Law</span><span>  Unions  on  grounds  of  economy.</span></p> <p><span>  The  intended  position  of  the  first  settle-</span><span>  ment  is  not  known.  Its  formation,  and  the</span><span>  appointment  of  the  whole  official  staff,</span><span>  except  the  Superintendent,  is  entrusted  to</span><span>  Sir  Charles  Fitzroy.  The  excepted  office</span><span>  is  stated  by  the  Sydney  journals  to  have</span><span>  been  already  conferred  on  Leut.-Colonel</span><span>  Barney,  formerly  at  the  head  of  the  ord-</span><span>  nance  department  in  this  colony,  at  a  salary</span><span>  of  £1500  a-year.  The  other  appointments</span><span>  are  to  be  made  as  far  as  possible  from</span><span>  those  persons  whose  employment  in  cer-</span><span>  tain  offices  appertaining  to  the  existing</span><span>  convict  department  will,  on  the  contem-</span><span>  plated  reduction  of  these  offices,  give  them</span><span>  claims  to  compensation.</span></p> <p><span>  We  will  shortly  recur  to  this  interesting</span><span>  subject.</span></p> ",Article,1846-08-15,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

"<p></p> <p><span>  THE</span><span>  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  AUGUST  22,  1846.</span></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  To  the  plan  of  isolation  considered  as  a  scheme  of</span></p> <p><span>  moral  reform,  the  first  and  most  obvious  objec-</span><span>  tion  is,  that  it  has  already  been  tried  to  some</span><span>  extent  at  Norfolk  Island,  and  that  the  result  of</span></p> <p><span>  that  experiment  is  not  such  as  to  encourage  a</span><span>  renewal  of  it  on  a  much  larger  scale.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  state  of  isolation,  there  can  be  no  prevail-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  tone  of  moral  sentiment,  but  such  as  is  the</span><span>  spontaneous  growth  of  a  convict  society.  It</span><span>  will  be  destitute  of  those  opinions  and  of  those</span><span>  feelings  which  must  be,  more  or  less,  engen-</span><span>  dered  by  the  close  vicinity  of  a  population  by</span></p> <p><span>  whom  personal  morality,  and  the  virtues  of</span><span>  public  and  domestic  life,  are  respected  and  cul-</span></p> <p><span>  tivated.  Few  men  are  so  abandoned  as  to  be</span></p> <p><span>  entirely  proof  against  the  healthful  contagion</span><span>  of  such  habits,  and  of  the  principles  by  which</span></p> <p><span>  they  are  sustained.  To  belong  to  a  community,</span><span>  by  the  higher  and  more  numerous  portion  of</span><span>  which  truth,  decency,  and  integrity,  are  hon-</span></p> <p><span>  oured,  and  religion  held  in  reverence,  must  be</span><span>  a  great,  though  an  indirect  blessing,  to  the</span><span>  most  abject,  and  the  most  unworthy  of  its</span></p> <p><span>  members.</span></p> <p><span>  Nor  would  the  influence  of  the  governing  body  in</span></p> <p><span>  such  an  isolated  position  supply  this  salutary</span><span>  impulse.  Convicts  must  live  under  an  energetic,</span><span>  prompt,  and  formidable  government.  Every</span><span>  such  government  tends  strongly  and  inevitably</span><span>  to  abuse,  and  the  only  effective  corrective  of</span><span>  such  abuses  is  the  censorship  of  public  opinion</span></p> <p><span>  as  expressed  through,  the  ordinary  popular</span><span>  channels.—Despatch  of  Lord  Stanley  to  the</span><span>  Governor  of  Van  Diemen's  Land.</span></p> <p><span>  The  southern  part  of  North  Australia  being  but</span></p> <p><span>  two  degrees  nearer  the  Equator  than  Moreton</span><span>  Bay,  may  be  expected  to  possess  a  great  resem-</span><span>  blance  to  that  settlement  in  climate,  and  to  par-</span><span>  take  of  the  general  salubrity  which  has  hitherto</span><span>  been  found  to  characterise  the  whole  of  the</span><span>  shores  of  New  Holland,  with  the  exception  per-</span><span>  haps  of  Port  Essington,  which  is  within  the</span><span>  Tropics,  and  only  twelve  degrees  south  of  the</span><span>  Equator.  It  is  a  region  in  which  men  may</span><span>  live,  without  danger,  under  canvass,  or  in  huts,</span><span>  during  the  gradual  erection  of  more  costly</span><span>  buildings.  It  possesses  vast  tracts  of  land</span><span>  covered  with  timber,  but,  in  common  with  the</span></p> <p><span>  rest  of  New  Holland,  is  traversable  in  every</span><span>  direction  without  the  necessity  for  forming</span><span>  roads.  It  is  ascertained  to  be  rich  in  natural</span><span>  productions,  and  susceptible  of  culture  by  Eu-</span><span>  ropeans  with  almost  every  article  for  the  growth</span><span>  of  which  the  powerful  action  of  the  sun  is</span><span>  requisite.  It  is,  moreover,  the  only  remaining</span><span>  part  of  the  east  coast  of  New  Holland  in  which</span><span>  a  field  could  be  opened  for  the  enterprise  of  such</span></p> <p><span>  pardoned  convicts  as  may  be  unable  to  obtain</span><span>  lucrative  situations  elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span>  Lord  Stanley  contemplates  the  gradual  and  pro-</span></p> <p><span>  bably  the  slow  formation  of  the  new  colony.—</span><span>  So  long  as  the  pardoned  convicts  might  be  able</span><span>  to  earn  an  independent  subsistence,  either  in</span><span>  Van  Diemen's  Land,  or  in  any  other  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  existing  Australian  settlements,  his  Lordship</span><span>  would  not  propose  to  transfer  them  to  North</span><span>  Australia  ;  consequently,  if  the  existing  embar-</span><span>  rassments  in  Van  Diemen's  Land  should  be</span><span>  otherwise  surmounted,  the  plan  of  the  projected</span><span>  colony  would  languish,  or  would  perhaps  never</span><span>  be  brought  into  operation  at  all.  But  on  the</span><span>  opposite,  and,  as  Lord  Stanley  apprehends,</span><span>  much  more  probable  supposition,  North  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  would  be  a  resource  by  means  of  which</span><span>  Van  Diemen's  Land  would  find  relief  from</span><span>  difficulties  otherwise  threatening  ruin  to  the</span><span>  existing  free  colonists,  the  waste  of  public</span><span>  treasure,  and  a  continued  degradation  of  the</span><span>  character  of  the  pardoned  offenders.  It  would</span><span>  be  a  resource  of  which  men  of  energetic  minds</span><span>  and  habits  would  gladly  avail  themselves.</span><span>  Letter  from  J.  Stephen,  Esq.,  to  C.  E.</span><span>  Trevelyan,  Esq.</span></p> <p><span>  The  foregoing  clearly  indicate  the  inten-</span></p> <p><span>  tions  of  the  Home  Government  with  re-</span></p> <p><span>  gard  to  the  new  settlement.  Northern</span><span>  Australia  is  not,  as  some  of  our  contem-</span><span>  poraries  persist  in  styling  it,  a  penal  co-</span><span>  lony.  The  emancipated  convicts,  landed</span><span>  there,  clothed  and  fed  at  the  expense  of</span><span>  the  British  Government,  are  to  all  intents</span><span>  and  purposes  free  subjects—free  to  migrate</span><span>  to  any  portion  of  the  Australian  colonies,</span><span>  in  which  they  can  obtain  an  honest  live-</span><span>  lihood.  Employers  of  labour  may  select</span><span>  servants,  from  Tropical  Australia,  equally</span><span>  as  from  Van  Diemen's  Land.  And  every</span><span>  capitalist  who  may  adventure  thither  will</span><span>  be,  and  be  regarded,  as  a  valuable  addition</span><span>  to  its  infant  society.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Waste  Lands  Act  will  not  take</span><span>  effect  in  North  Australia.  The  reason  of</span></p> <p><span>  this  is  obvious.  The  great  feature  of  the</span><span>  new  colonizing  scheme  is,  that  lands  shall</span><span>  be  assigned  to  the  settlers,  for  culture,  in</span><span>  order  that  they  may  be  enabled  to  main-</span><span>  tain  themselves.  They  will  have  no  pro-</span><span>  perty  in  the  soil.  Their  interest  therein</span><span>  will  cease,  when  they  cease  to  cultivate.</span><span>  To  assign  lands  on  such  a  tenure,  and  to</span><span>  supply  the  necessary  capital  to  the  occu-</span><span>  piers,  in  the  shape  of  food,  clothing,  and</span><span>  tools,  will,  we  need  scarcely  say,  be  alto-</span><span>  gether  contrary  to  the  spirit  of  the  Act  in</span><span>  question.  It  is  therefore  precluded  from</span><span>  coming  into  operation.  No  hindrance  or</span><span>  opposition  to  the  progress  of  the  squatting</span><span>  interest  needs,  however,  be  feared.  Our</span><span>  hardy  pioneers  may  safely  follow  the</span><span>  promptings  of  enterprize,  even  to  the  very</span><span>  walls  of  the  Northern  Capital.  They  will</span><span>  not  be  checked  in  their  career,  but  will</span><span>  occupy  their  merited  position  in  a  country</span><span>  which  Nature  has  clearly  designed  for  a</span><span>  pastoral  community.</span></p> <p><span>  The  project  of  forming  a  new  colony</span><span>  in  Northern  Australia  has  engaged  the</span></p> <p><span>  attention  of  the  Home  Government  since</span></p> <p><span>  the  beginning  of  the  year  1844—not,</span><span>  however,  in  the  first  instance,  as  a  sequel</span><span>  </span><span>  of  the  Probation  System  of  Van  Diemen's</span><span>  Land,  but  of  the  assimilating  reformatory</span><span>  scheme  which  came  into  operation  about</span><span>  the  same  period,  at  Pentonville—a  scheme</span><span>  which  originated  in  a  recommendation  of</span><span>  the  Inspectors  of  English  prisons.  The</span><span>  projected  colony  was  the  natural  effect  of</span><span>  the  necessity  which  existed,  of  devising</span></p> <p><span>  some  medium  state  between  the  strict</span></p> <p><span>  punishment  of  the  prison,  and  a  state  of</span><span>  absolute  freedom  and  consequent  probable</span><span>  reversion  by  the  expirees  to  former  as-</span><span>  sociations  and  crimes.  On  the  first  inti-</span><span>  mation  of  the  Government's  intentions,</span><span>  with  regard  to  these  men,  obtaining  pub-</span><span>  licity,  Mr.  W.  H.  Yaldwyn,  a  Port  Phillip</span><span>  stockholder,  then  residing  in  London,  im-</span><span>  mediately  wrote  to  the  Home  Secretary</span><span>  stating  his  willingness  to  receive  twenty-</span><span>  one  into  his  service  ;  and  as  the  evident</span><span>  and  natural  inference  to  be  drawn  from</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Yaldwyn's  letter,  was,  that  many  of</span><span>  his  fellow  colonists  would  be  equally</span><span>  willing  to  hire  them  if  opportunity  were</span><span>  afforded,  of  doing  so,  Ministers  resolved</span><span>  upon  sending  a  ship-load  to  these  colo-</span><span>  nies  ;  to  be  formed  either  into  a  separate</span><span>  settlement  or  labor  depot,  or  to  be  distri-</span><span>  buted  amongst  the  settlers  of  any  district</span><span>  in  which  their  services  might  be  in  de-</span><span>  mand.  Lord  Stanley,  in  announcing  the</span><span>  conclusions  thus  arrived  at,  to  Sir  Eardley</span><span>  Wilmot,  in  a  despatch  dated  27th  July,</span></p> <p><span>  1844,  also  remarked  as  follows  :—</span></p> <p><span>  Her  Majesty's  Government  regard  it  as  indis-</span><span>  pensable  that  provision  should  be  made  for  the</span><span>  maintenance,  in  a  state  of  freedom,  of  that  par-</span><span>  ticular  class  of  convicts  whom  I  have  designated</span><span>  as  exiles  ;  and  that  they  should  be  exempted  not</span><span>  only  from  the  severe  lot  of  other  convicts,  but  as</span><span>  far  as  possible  from  the  temptations  incident  to  an</span><span>  habitual  association  with  them.  For  this  purpose</span><span>  we  are  willing  to  incur  every  unavoidable  expense.</span></p> <p><span>  We  think,  however,  that  the  expense  ought  not</span><span>  to  be  great.  These  are  persons  of  whom  we  have</span><span>  every  reason  to  believe  that  they  require  no  parti-</span><span>  cular  restraint  or  costly  superintendence  ;  and  in</span><span>  the  extensive  territories  of  the  Crown  in  Australia</span><span>  it  seems  scarcely  doubtful  that  such  persons  could</span><span>  either  find  adequate  employment  at  a  sufficient</span><span>  rate  of  wages,  or,  by  forming  a  settlement  apart,</span><span>  earn  their  own  subsistence  by  the  cultivation  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  soil.</span></p> <p><span>  Each  of  them  has  been  instructed  and  will  be</span><span>  found  moderately  skilled  in  some  mechanical  art.</span><span>  This  may  at  once  facilitate  their  obtaining  em-</span><span>  ployment,  or  the  formation  of  a  separate  settlement.</span><span>  His  Lordship  further  suggested  the  ne-</span><span>  cessity  of  a  conference  between  Sir  George</span><span>  Gipps,  Sir  Eardley  Wilmot,  and  Mr.  La-</span><span>  trobe,  ""  provisionally  to  decide  on  the  best</span><span>  mode  of  providing  for  the  reception  and</span><span>  employment  of  these  persons  ;""  and  in</span></p> <p><span>  obedience  to  his  wishes  their  Excellencies</span><span>  and  His  Honor  resolved  upon  meeting,  to</span><span>  consult  upon  the  subject,  at  Launceston.</span></p> <p><span>  The  ship  Sir  George  Seymour,  having</span><span>  on  board  176  exiles,  91  ticket-of-leave</span><span>  holders,  and  78  passholders,  left  England</span><span>  in  the  month  of  November  following.</span></p> <p><span>  The  exiles  were  destined  for  the  projected</span></p> <p><span>  settlement  ;  the  two  other  classes  were  to</span><span>  be  placed  under  the  surveillance  of  the</span><span>  Government  of  Van  Diemen's  Land.  In</span></p> <p><span>  a  despatch  dated  Oct.  1844,  advising  Sir</span><span>  Eardley  of  the  vessel's  intended  departure,</span><span>  the  ex-Secretary  writes  :—</span></p> <p><span>  But  in  the  contingency  to  which  I  have  ad-</span><span>  verted,  of  the  formation  of  a  labor  depot  to  be  re-</span><span>  cruited  by  prisoners  sent  from  this  country  as</span><span>  exiles,  not  as  convicts,  the  necessity  may  arise  for</span><span>  creating  and  maintaining  offices  for  the  control</span><span>  and  government  of  such  an  institution.  I  refer</span><span>  it  to  the  discretion  of  yourself,  Sir  George  Gipps,</span></p> <p><span>  and  Mr.  Latrobe  to  determine  what  those  offices</span><span>  should  be,  and  what  should  be  the  rate  of  remu-</span><span>  neration.  It  is  superfluous  to  insist  on  the  neces-</span><span>  sity  of  incurring  no  expense  beyond  what  may  be</span><span>  requisite  for  the  efficient  discharge  of  this  duty.</span><span>  But  as  far  as  it  is  possible  to  form  a  judgment  at</span><span>  this  distance,  and  in  the  existing  uncertainty  as</span><span>  to  the  course  which  may  be  taken,  I  think  that  it</span><span>  may  probably  be  necessary  to  employ  three  offi-</span><span>  cers  ;  that  is,  a  superintendent,  an  assistant  su-</span><span>  perintendent,  and  a  religious  instructor  ;  one  of</span><span>  the  two  superintendents  being  a  medical  officer,</span><span>  and  acting  also  in  that  capacity.</span></p> <p><span>  Contemplating  the  possibility  of  such  arrange-</span><span>  ments,  Mr.  Hampton  has  offered  to  serve  as  su-</span><span>  perintendent  and  surgeon  at  £700  per  annum  for</span><span>  the  first  year,  and  at  £600  per  annum  for  each</span><span>  following  year.  Mr.  Boyd  has  offered  to  serve  as</span><span>  assistant  superintendent  at  £200,  and  Mr.  Cairn-</span><span>  duff,  at  the  same  rate,  as  religious  instructor.</span></p> <p><span>  Each  of  these  gentlemen  stipulates  for  being</span><span>  further  provided  with  food  and  lodging,  in  kind,</span><span>  or  by  a  commutation  in  money  at  such  a  rate  in</span><span>  either  case  as  the  local  government  may  think</span><span>  reasonable.  They  are  all  well  aware  that  the</span><span>  formation  of  the  settlement  at  all  is  uncertain,</span><span>  and  that  the  continuance  of  it  is  precarious.</span></p> <p><span>  If  the  plan  of  forming  a  depot  of  labour  should</span><span>  be  adopted,  it  would  be  of  great  importance  to</span><span>  prevent  the  members  of  it  from  acquiring  a  pro-</span><span>  prietary  title  or  claims  likely  to  ripen  into  such  a</span><span>  title  to  any  lands  which,  in  their  character  of</span><span>  exiles,  dependent  on  the  Government,  they  may</span><span>  cultivate  for  their  own  support,  or  even  to  the</span><span>  crops  growing  on  such  lands.  The  fundamental</span><span>  principle  of  every  such  settlement  should  be,  that</span><span>  it  is  the  temporary  receptacle,  not  the  permanent</span><span>  abode,  of  its  inmates,  and  no  opportunity  should</span><span>  be  lost  of  inculcating  that  principle,  or  of  en-</span><span>  forcing  the  observance  of  it.</span></p> <p><span>  The  necessity  of  a  conference  to  decide</span><span>  upon  the  disposal  of  the  exiles,  was,  as</span><span>  many  of  our  readers  are  aware  obviated</span><span>  by  an  application  made  to  the  local  Go-</span><span>  vernment  by  the  stockholders  of  the  Gee-</span><span>  long  district.  The  latter  at  once  saw  the  ad-</span><span>  vantages  to  be  derived  from  securing  these</span><span>  men  as  laborers,  in  preference  to  an  equal</span><span>  number  of  probationists  from  Van  Die-</span><span>  men's  Land.  Their  request  that  the  exiles</span><span>  might  be  landed  at  Geelong  was  of  course</span><span>  gladly  acceded  to  ;  for  in  acceding,  the</span><span>  Government  knew  that  they  were  satis-</span><span>  factorily  carrying  out  the  wishes  of</span><span>  Ministers  upon  the  subject.</span></p> <p><span>  The  exiles,  since  their  sojourn  at  Port</span><span>  Phillip,  as  a  body  have  distinguished</span><span>  themselves  for  morality  and  good-beha-</span><span>  viour  ;  and  from,  the  knowledge  of  me-</span><span>  chanical  arts  imparted  to  them  at  the</span><span>  Penitentiary,  have  proved  very  useful  in</span><span>  all  kinds  of  labor  requiring  the  exercise</span><span>  of  ingenuity.  Although  less  in  point  of</span><span>  number  than  the  Probationists,  it  cannot</span><span>  be  doubted  that  this  class  of  men  will,</span><span>  socially  speaking,  be  of  far  more  impor-</span><span>  tance  in  the  degree  of  influence  which  even</span><span>  they  must  possess  on  the  destinies  of  the</span><span>  new  colony.  Convicted  of  slight  offences</span></p> <p><span>  and  selected  on  that  account  from  the</span></p> <p><span>  mass,  they  are  subjected,  during  periods</span><span>  extending  from  fifteen  to  twenty-two</span><span>  months,  to  the  beneficial  influences  of</span><span>  strict  seclusion,  rigid  discipline,  and  reli-</span><span>  gious  and  industrial  instruction.  As  a</span><span>  large  proportion  of  them  are  educated,</span><span>  habits  of  reflection  are  more  easily  su-</span><span>  perinduced  ;  and  a  taste  for  moral  plea-</span><span>  sures  more  readily  implanted  in  their</span><span>  minds,  than  in  the  minds  of  the  more</span></p> <p><span>  ignorant  and  brutalized.  Originally  better</span><span>  in  most  instances  than  those  transported</span><span>  to  Van  Diemen's  Land—subjected  to  a</span><span>  system  of  discipline  which,  if  not  excel-</span><span>  ling  in  conception,  has  yet  the  advantage</span><span>  of  being  far  more  successful  in  execution</span></p> <p><span>  than  the  Probation  System,  these  men,  it</span><span>  cannot  be  disputed,  are  much  more  to  be</span><span>  desired,  whether  as  laborers  or  colonists.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Hampton,  the  surgeon-superin-</span><span>  tendent  of  the  Sir  George  Seymour,  in</span><span>  his  report  to  Sir  Eardley  Wilmot,  gives</span><span>  the  following  gratifying  account  of  those</span></p> <p><span>  entrusted  to  his  care  :—</span></p> <p><span>  Sunday  schools  were  established  specially  for</span><span>  the  religious  instruction  of  the  convicts,  and  were</span><span>  evidently  more  valuable  in  consequence  of  the  at-</span></p> <p><span>  tendance  being  altogether  voluntary.  One  hun-</span><span>  dred  and  ninety-eight  of  the  prisoners  attended</span><span>  these  schools  with  much  diligence,  and  there  is</span><span>  every  reason  to  believe,  much  profit.</span></p> <p><span>  Divine  Service  was  performed  morning  and</span><span>  evening  every  Sunday  after  the  embarkation  of</span><span>  the  convicts  ;  the  Church  of  England  service  and</span><span>  a  sermon  being  read  each  time.  The  morning</span><span>  services  were  conducted  by  myself,  the  evening  by</span><span>  the  religious  instructor.  To  improve  the  prison-</span><span>  ers'  minds,  as  well  as  to  increase  their  self-respect</span><span>  and  estimation  of  each  other,  a  certain  number  of</span><span>  the  most  intelligent  were  selected,  and  encouraged</span><span>  to  deliver  lectures  to  their  fellow-prisoners  in  the</span><span>  evenings,  on  instructive  and  interesting  subjects  ;</span><span>  and  many  of  these  lectures,  as  well  as  the  attentive</span><span>  manner  in  which  they  were  listened  to,  would  have</span><span>  done  credit  to  similar  meetings  of  free  men  having</span><span>  much  greater  pretensions.</span></p> <p><span>  Among  the  subjects  selected  by  the  lecturers,  I</span><span>  may  mention—The  advantages  of  education—The</span><span>  use  and  abuse  of  music—Comparative  anatomy—</span><span>  English  history—The  origin  of  names—Universal</span><span>  history  —  Astronomy  —  Poetry  —  Ornithology  —</span><span>  Characteristics  of  the  human  race—Circulation  of</span><span>  the  blood  —The  duties  of  domestic  servants—Ar-</span><span>  chitecture—&c.</span></p> <p><span>  A  weekly  newspaper  was  proposed,  edited,  and</span><span>  carried  on  by  the  prisoners  in  a  highly  cre-</span></p> <p><span>  ditable  manner.</span></p> <p><span>  As  an  opinion  prevails  very  generally  that  the</span><span>  separate  system  in  force  at  Pentonville  Prison</span><span>  weakens  the  mind,  and  often  causes  insanity,  I  feel</span><span>  bound  to  state,  in  the  most  emphatic  terms,  that</span><span>  it  did  not  produce  the  slightest  mental  imbecility</span><span>  in  any  of  the  345  men  under  my  charge,  and</span><span>  that,  in  my  opinion,  their  minds  were  in  a  much</span><span>  more  healthy  state  than  is  usual  amongst  ordinary</span><span>  convicts,  or  even  any  similar  number  of  men  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  same  station  in  life.  The  only  mental  effect  I</span><span>  observed  has  been  already  noticed,  for  want  of  a</span><span>  better  term,  as  the  loss  of  gregarious  habits.</span></p> <p><span>  The  only  punishment  found  necessary  during</span><span>  the  voyage  was  putting  five  men  in  solitary  con-</span><span>  finement  for  short  periods.</span></p> <p><span>  During  the  time  these  men  were  under  my</span><span>  charge  I  was  generally  amongst  them  from  day-</span><span>  light  until  after  sunset,  and  never  heard  one  make</span><span>  use  of  an  oath,  or  even  intemperate  language  ;</span><span>  never  saw  any  quarrelling  or  fighting,  but,  on</span><span>  the  contrary,  they  had  in  general  a  quiet,  sub-</span><span>  dued,  thoughtful  manner  most  pleasing  to  observe,</span><span>  and  calculated  to  inspire  the  greatest  confidence</span><span>  in  their  good  intentions.</span></p> <p><span>  Of  their  state  of  education  on  debarking,</span><span>  Mr.  Hampton  gives  the  following  interest-</span><span>  ing  summary  :—</span></p> <p><span>  Reading—</span></p> <p><span>  Read  well............  182</span><span>  —  tolerably............114</span></p> <p><span>  —  imperfectly.........  48</span><span>  —  scarcely  at  all.......  8</span></p> <p><span>  —  not  at  all.............  0</span><span>  Writing—</span></p> <p><span>  Write  well...........  38</span><span>  —  tolerably........  79</span></p> <p><span>  —  imperfectly......  214</span></p> <p><span>  —  scarcely  at  all.....  8</span><span>  —  not  at  all............  5</span><span>  Arithmetic—</span></p> <p><span>  Can  do  the  higher  rules....  104</span></p> <p><span>  —  to  proportion.............  82</span><span>  —  all  the  compound  rules.......  64</span><span>  —  all  the  simple  rules..........  64</span><span>  —  to  multiplication.......  18</span></p> <p><span>  —  to  addition...............  11</span></p> <p><span>  —  scarcely  or  none  at  all......  5</span></p> <p><span>  We  cannot  conclude  without  a  passing</span><span>  notice  of  the  canting,  mawkish  sentimen-</span></p> <p><span>  tality  which  appears  to  influence  sundry</span><span>  of  our  contemporaries  in  their  notices  of</span><span>  Northern  Australia.  They  inveigh  against</span><span>  the  bad  faith  of  the  British  Government,</span><span>  and  denounce  the  new  colony  as  a  great</span><span>  artery  through  which  the  diseased  hu-</span><span>  mours  of  a  feculent  society  are  to  be  con-</span><span>  veyed  amongst  us.  But  in  what  has  bad</span><span>  faith  been  displayed  ?  We,  the  colonists</span><span>  of  New  South  Wales,  rush  into  the  labor</span><span>  market  of  Van  Diemen's  Land,  eager</span><span>  competitors  for  the  services  of  its  expirees,</span><span>  endeavouring  to  outbid  each  other  in</span><span>  tempting  offers  of  good  wages  and  abun-</span><span>  dant  rations.  We  bring  them  to  our</span><span>  shores,  at  our  own  expense,  amidst  mu-</span><span>  tual  gratulations.  The  people  of  Port</span><span>  Phillip  have  done  this,  and  more  ;  they</span><span>  have  petitioned  the  local  Government</span><span>  that  all  incoming  cargoes  of  exiles  may</span><span>  be  landed  amongst  them.  And  yet  we</span><span>  coolly  turn  round,  and  blame  Ministers</span><span>  for  contemplating  what  must  in  effect,</span><span>  if  our  words  do  not  belie  our  deeds,  fa-</span><span>  cilitate  our  views—for  aiming  to  form  a</span><span>  labor  depot,  from  which  these  men  may</span><span>  be  readily  transferred  to  us  without  trouble</span><span>  or  expense  of  agency  !  Our  own  act  is</span><span>  ratified—an  act  resulting  from  the  irre-</span><span>  sistible  laws  of  necessity,  and  the  effect  of</span><span>  practical  good  sense—and,  forsooth,  the</span><span>  finger  of  pious  horror  must  be  uplifted,</span><span>  and  we  must  stand  aghast  at  what  is</span><span>  enormity  in  the  British  Government  but</span><span>  commendable  in  ourselves  !  Away  with</span><span>  such  hypocrisy  !  Cheap  and  abundant</span><span>  labor  is  an  essential  adjunct  of  our  pros-</span><span>  perity  ;  and  the  instinct  of  self-preserva-</span><span>  tion  must  urge,  as  it  has  already  urged</span><span>  us,  to  avail  ourselves  of  it,  wherever  it</span><span>  can  be  obtained.</span></p> ",Article,1846-08-22,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

"<p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  MORETON  BAY  COURIER.</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  NOVEMBER  14,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  We  recollect  having  heard  a  story  of  an</span><span>  ill-natured  schoolboy,  who  was  a  greedy</span><span>  gut  ;  and  who  on  being  asked  for  a  portion</span><span>  of  a  very  large  cake  which  had  been  sent</span><span>  to  him  as  a  present,  refused  to  share  it</span><span>  with  his  companions,  saying,  ""  I  never</span><span>  give  to  those  boys  who  ask,  and  those</span><span>  who  don't  ask  don't  want.  ""  This  is  a</span><span>  tolerably  apt  illustration  of  the  relative</span><span>  position  of  the  inhabitants  of  Moreton  Bay</span></p> <p><span>  and  the  Government.  Since  the  settle-</span><span>  ment  has  been  established,  Government</span><span>  has  derived  a  very  considerable  revenue</span><span>  from  the  sales  of  land,  rental  of  public</span><span>  buildings,  office  fees  and  fines,  licenses,</span><span>  and  ferries,  the  proceeds  of  which  have</span><span>  been  sent  to  Sydney,  and  expended  for  the</span><span>  benefit  of  other  districts  to  the  neglect  and</span><span>  injury  of  our  own.  And  why  is  this  ?</span><span>  Expound  Mr.  Colonial  Secretary  and  Mr.</span><span>  McLeay  !  Oh,  says  Mr.  McLeay,  Govern-</span><span>  ment  seldom  give  to  those  who  ask  ;  oh,</span><span>  says  the  Colonial  Secretary,  you  have</span><span>  never  asked,  and,  therefore,  you  don't</span><span>  want.""  True  'tis  a  pity,  and  pity  'tis  'tis</span><span>  true.  They  are  both  right,  and  between</span><span>  the  two  stools  we  have  fallen  to  the</span><span>  ground.  Arise,  then,  ye  Brisbanites,</span><span>  shake  off  the  languor  that  has  prostrated</span><span>  your  energies.  It  is  high  time  that  you</span><span>  should  understand  your  real  position</span><span>  demand  your  rights,  and  be  prepared  to</span><span>  maintain  them.  Our  more  immediate</span><span>  business,  however,  is  with  the  ferries,  and</span><span>  the  appropriation  of  the  funds  derived</span><span>  from  them.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Act  of  Council,  2  William  4th,  No.</span><span>  12,  enacts  that  it  shall  and  may  be  lawful</span><span>  for  the  Governor  to  appoint  places  where</span><span>  tolls  and  ferries  may  be  established  or</span><span>  continued.  The  object  of  the  Act,  as</span><span>  stated  in  the  preamble,  is  to  make  pro-</span><span>  vision  for  the  raising  of  funds  towards</span><span>  making,  repairing,  and  upholding  public</span><span>  roads  and  bridges  in  the  colony.  The</span></p> <p><span>  seventh  clause  fixes  the  scale  of  fees  at</span></p> <p><span>  ferries,  which  is  as  follows  :</span></p> <p><span>  s.  d.</span></p> <p><span>  For  every  foot  passenger.  0  2</span><span>  For  every  horse,  mare,  gelding,  ass,  or</span></p> <p><span>  mule,  drawing  or  not  drawing.  0  6</span><span>  For  every  gig,  dray,  or  cart,  with  two</span></p> <p><span>  wheels  only.  1  0</span><span>  For  every  waggon,  carriage,  or  other</span></p> <p><span>  vehicle,  with  four  wheels.  1  6</span><span>  For  every  ox,  or  head  of  neat  cattle,  not</span></p> <p><span>  exceeding  ten  in  number.  0  4</span><span>  For  every  ox,  or  head  of  neat  cattle,  being</span></p> <p><span>  more  than  ten  in  number.  0  3</span></p> <p><span>  For  every  sheep,  lamb,  pig,  or  goat..  0  01/2</span><span>  It  is  not  lawful  for  any  person,  save  the</span><span>  ferrymen  duly  appointed  under  the  Act,</span><span>  to  employ  on  hire,  or  for  fee  or  reward,</span><span>  any  boats  for  the  conveyance  of  passengers</span><span>  or  goods,  within  one  mile  of  the  place</span><span>  where  a  ferry  is  established,  except  in  case</span><span>  of  flood  or  fire,  in  the  pursuit  of  felons,  or</span><span>  other  urgent  and  unavoidable  necessity,</span><span>  under  penalty  of  twenty  shillings  for  each</span></p> <p><span>  offence,</span></p> <p><span>  Now  we  should  not  quarrel  about  the</span><span>  scale  of  fees,  provided  only  one  ferry  were</span><span>  established  in  Brisbane,  and  the  proceeds</span><span>  were  devoted  to  local  improvements.  But</span><span>  there  being  two  ferries,  one  from  North  to</span><span>  South  Brisbane,  and  the  other  from  North</span><span>  Brisbane  to  Kangaroo  Point,  it  is  of  the</span><span>  utmost  importance  either  that  the  scale</span><span>  should  be  reduced  one-half,  or,  that  the</span><span>  whole  of  the  sum  netted  at  auction  should</span><span>  be  expended  for  the  benefit  of  the  inhabi-</span><span>  tants.  What  conceivable  right  the  Go-</span><span>  vernment  has  to  go  on  extracting  a  large</span><span>  amount  of  ferry  money  annually  from  our</span><span>  pockets,  and  applying  it  to  other  than</span><span>  purely  local  purposes,  such  as  the  im-</span><span>  provement  of  the  roads  and  bridges,  we  are</span><span>  at  a  loss  to  conjecture.  Loud  and  un-</span><span>  ceasing  complaints  are  made  by  the  in-</span><span>  habitants  in  consequence  of  the  expensive</span><span>  and  restricted  medium  of  communication</span><span>  between  the  three  places.  For  instance,</span><span>  if  a  person  residing  at  Kangaroo  Point</span><span>  wishes  to  transact  business  in  South  Bris</span></p> <p><span>  bane,  he  has  to  pay  eightpence  to  the</span><span>  Government,  for  the  glorious  liberty  of</span><span>  crossing  the  river  in  the  licensed  imposi-</span><span>  tion  ferry  boats.  We  maintain  that  it  is</span><span>  the  duty  of  Government  to  remove  obsta-</span><span>  cles  of  this  kind,  for  internal  commerce</span><span>  should  not  be  interrupted  by  such  op-</span><span>  pressive  tolls,  or  by  restrictive  regulations.</span><span>  They  should  expunge  from  the  statute-</span><span>  book  every  clause  which  in  its  effect  tends</span><span>  to  fetter  the  operations  of  the  trader,</span><span>  without  giving  him  .a  corresponding  ad-</span><span>  vantage.  It  requires  no  argument  to</span><span>  demonstrate  the  pernicious  results  that</span><span>  accrue  to  a  trading  community,  and  more,</span><span>  particularly  to  a  young  community,  from</span><span>  exorbitant  tolls.  When  too  high,  they</span><span>  obstruct  that  intercourse  which  they  were</span><span>  originally  intended  to  promote,  and  are</span><span>  </span><span>  of  the  inhabitants  of  that  locality  where,</span></p> <p><span>  unhappily,  they  are  exacted.  We  feel</span><span>  assured  that  the  residents  would  cheerfully</span><span>  pay  moderate  dues,  provided  the  funds</span><span>  were  devoted  to  local  purposes.  As  yet,</span><span>  Government  has  failed  of  making  any</span><span>  provision  whatever  for  the  construction</span><span>  of  roads  and  bridges  in  the  district.  This</span><span>  neglect  is  to  be  attributed  to  our  own</span><span>  supineness  in  these  matters.</span></p> <p><span>  The  time  is  fast  approaching  when  the</span><span>  ferry  tolls  will  be  let  by  auction  for  an-</span><span>  other  term  not  exceeding  twelve  months.</span><span>  We  propose  that  a  public  meeting  be  called</span><span>  for  the  purpose  of  memorialising  the  Go-</span><span>  vernment  on  the  subject.  Let  application</span><span>  be  made  to  the  proper  authorities  to  ap-</span><span>  propriate  the  funds,  hereafter  to  be  col-</span><span>  lected,  for  the  construction  and  repairs  of</span><span>  the  roads  and  bridges,  and  towards  the</span><span>  effecting  of  other  improvements  in  the</span><span>  districts.  It  has  been  suggested  to  us  that</span><span>  the  money  should  be  placed  at  the  disposal</span><span>  of  the  District  Association,  when  that</span><span>  body  shall  have  been  re-organised,  and  a</span><span>  new  chairman  appointed.  At  present  the</span><span>  office  of  chairman  is  vacant,  the  gentleman</span><span>  who  filled  it  having  resigned  on  account</span><span>  of  not  being  a  resident  in  the  town.  We</span><span>  have  good  authority  for  stating  that  the</span><span>  Government  are  disposed  to  comply  with</span><span>  our  wishes  in  respect  of  the  ferry  tolls  ;</span><span>  but  it  is  not  very  likely  they  will  help  us,</span><span>  unless  we  evince  a  disposition  to  help</span></p> <p><span>  ourselves.</span></p> ",Article,1846-11-14,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

"<p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  Moreton  Bay  Courier</span></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  DECEMBER  26,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  INDIAN  LABOUR.</span></p> <p><span>  With  regard  to  the  moral  habits  of  the</span><span>  Coolies,  Mr.  Friell  states  that  they  are  not</span><span>  inferior  to  the  Europeans  ;  and,  consider-</span><span>  ing  the  disadvantages  under  which  they</span><span>  labour,  superior  to  the  immigrants  from</span><span>  Great  Britain.  Drunkenness  is  a  vice  not</span></p> <p><span>  practised  amongst  them.  The  climate  has</span><span>  improved  rather  than  injured  the  constitu-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  of  the  Indians.</span></p> <p><span>  We  perfectly  agree  with  the  author  that</span><span>  they  should  be  employed  at  stations  where</span><span>  there  are  no  Europeans,  excepting  those</span><span>  required  as  bullock-drivers.  We  believe</span><span>  that  this  plan  has  been  carried  out  at  Mr.</span><span>  Friell's  station,  on  the  Stuart  River,  and</span><span>  experience  has  proved  that  the  exclusive</span><span>  system  is  the  best,  as  it  prevents  the</span><span>  Indian  from  being  tampered  with  by  the</span><span>  European.</span></p> <p><span>  In  selecting  labourers  in  India,  it  is  re-</span><span>  commended  that  the  Hindoo  should  be</span><span>  preferred  to  the  Mussulman  ;  but  the</span><span>  Gurraree,  or  Bheree  Wallah  and  Gwallahs</span><span>  (shepherds  and  cowherds),  are  decidedly</span><span>  the  best  class,  as  they  are  ready-made  to</span><span>  their  trade.  These  men  can  be  readily</span><span>  procured,  as  thousand's  are  to  be  seen</span><span>  loitering  about  the  Emigration  offices  in</span><span>  Calcutta,  ready  to  ship  on  almost  any</span><span>  terms.  It  is  essentially  necessary,  how-</span><span>  ever,  that  great  care  should  be  taken  in</span><span>  the  selection  ;  for  their  future  success  in</span><span>  this  country  will  depend  entirely  upon  the</span><span>  agents'  choice  of  men.  With  regard  to</span><span>  the  expense  that  must  be  incurred  in  pro-</span><span>  curing  them,  it  is  calculated  that  the  cost</span><span>  of  passage  will  be  ....  £10  0  0</span><span>  The  fee  for  engaging  them,</span></p> <p><span>  including  provisions  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  voyage  and  clothing,  each  2  5  0</span><span>  Other  incidental  expenses,  do  1  15  0</span></p> <p><span>  £14  0  0</span></p> <p><span>  Upon  a  large  scale,  it  is  considered  that</span><span>  £8  per  head  for  passage  (without  provi-</span><span>  sions)  would  amply  remunerate  the  ship-</span><span>  owner,  as  the  voyage  can  be  accomplished,</span><span>  at  the  proper  season  of  the  year,  in  two</span></p> <p><span>  months.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  no  doubt  that  the  statements</span><span>  of  the  author  are  correct,  for  his  observa-</span><span>  tions  are  evidently  written  in  the  spirit  of</span><span>  candour  and  of  truth.  He  has,  however,</span><span>  entirely  failed  in  convincing  us  that</span><span>  Coolie  labour  is  to  be  preferred  to  that</span><span>  from  Europe.  So  urgent,  however,  is  the</span><span>  demand  for  labour  in  this  district,  that  we</span><span>  think  it  is  probable  many  of  the  employ-</span><span>  ers  are  favourably  disposed  towards  the</span><span>  introduction  of  Coolies.  We  doubt  very</span><span>  much,  unless  Government  countenance  the</span><span>  importation  of  such  labourers,  (which  they</span><span>  are  not  likely  to  do),  whether  the  result</span><span>  of  individual  exertions  will  turn  out  satis-</span></p> <p><span>  factorily.  Of  one  thing  we  feel  quite</span><span>  confident-unless  they  are  kept  apart</span><span>  from  Europeans,  no  advantages  will  ac-</span><span>  crue  from  this  description  of  labour.  There</span><span>  are  many  reasons  why  they  should  be</span><span>  kept  separate  from  the  Europeans.  In  the</span><span>  first  place,  any  attempt  to  amalgamate</span><span>  them  could  not  be  effected  so  long  as  there</span><span>  exists  an  inequality  of  wages  between</span><span>  the  whites  and  the  Indians  on  the  same</span><span>  station.  Every  employer  knows  well  that</span><span>  this  inequality  is  one  of  the  most  fruitful</span><span>  sources  of  discontent  even  among  the</span><span>  Europeans.  The  labourer  who  is  paid  less</span><span>  wages  for  the  same  kind  of  work  than,  his</span><span>  fellows,  becomes  dissatisfied  from  a  sense</span><span>  of  inferiority,  and  will  never  make  a</span><span>  good  servant.  Uniformity  of  wages  must</span><span>  be  maintained,  or  the  system  cannot  work</span><span>  well.  In  the  next  place,  the  experiment</span><span>  cannot  be  successful,  unless  there  be  some</span></p> <p><span>  thing  like  an  equalisation  of  the  sexes  ;</span><span>  and  we  apprehend  that  the  expense  of  in-</span><span>  troducing  the  wives  of  the  Coolies  with</span><span>  their  own  husbands,  would  be  so  great</span><span>  that  few  employers  will  be  found  able  and</span><span>  willing  to  attempt  it.  Mr.  Friell  does  not</span><span>  recommend  the  introduction  of  women,</span><span>  because,  he  says,  no  native  carries  his  wife</span><span>  with  him  wherever  he  may  proceed  to  seek</span><span>  his  fortune.  She  is  left  in  his  village,  and</span><span>  he  returns  to  her.  We  differ  from  the</span><span>  author  in  this  view  of  the  subject,  and</span><span>  maintain  the  opinions  we  have  already</span><span>  expressed.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  whole,  we  are  of  opinion  that</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Friell's  account  of  the  results  of</span></p> <p><span>  Coolie  labour  is  deserving  the  attention  of</span><span>  the  squatters,  who,  of  course,  are  the</span><span>  parties  more  competent  to  judge  as  to  its</span><span>  expediency  than  ourselves.  Some  may</span><span>  prefer  this  description  of  labour  as  a  matter</span><span>  of  taste  ;  but  we  think  that  few,  after</span><span>  perusing  the  pamphlet  now  under  consi-</span><span>  deration,  will  he  disposed  to  employ  it  in</span><span>  preference  to  that  about  to  arrive  from</span><span>  Europe.</span></p> ",Article,1846-12-26,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

Shorn  of  its  few  plausibilities,</span><span>  the  whole  affair  presents  such  an  aspect  of</span><span>  the  ridiculous,  that  the  general  mass  of</span><span>  the  colonists  do  nothing  else  than  laugh</span><span>  at  it  ;  and  somewhat  recovered  from  their</span><span>  indiscreet  earnestness,  and  having  exer-</span><span>  cised  a  little  reflection,  the  movers  begin</span><span>  to  perceive  that  the  whole  affair  will  come</span><span>  toppling  over  with  the  weight  of  its  own</span><span>  absurdity,  and  are  now  preparing  them-</span><span>  selves  for  a  more  rational  course  than  the</span><span>  one  urged  upon  the  colonists  by  the  public</span><span>  meeting  held  in  Sydney  a  short  time  ago,</span><span>  This  ebullition  of  feeling  had  its  origin,  it</span><span>  seems,  with  persons  upon  whose  mental</span><span>  vision  suddenly  burst  the  glaring  convic-</span><span>  tion  that  the  Government  were  about  in-</span></p> <p><span>  flicting  on  a  body  of  people  one  of  the</span><span>  greatest  nuisances  that  had  ever  been  per-</span><span>  petrated  since,  the  days  of  Aristotle.  A</span><span>  meeting  was  forthwith  called,  and  was</span><span>  attended,  of  course,  by  those  persons</span><span>  inimical  to  the  revival  of  transportation.</span><span>  We  have  carefully  perused  the  speeches</span><span>  on  that  occasion,  and  however  we  may</span><span>  respect  the  motives  of  the  parties  who</span><span>  delivered  them,  we  have  sought  in  vain</span><span>  for  any  substantial  reasons  for  their</span><span>  outcries,  or  for  their  denunciations  against</span><span>  those  employers  of  labour  who  entertain</span><span>  contrary  views.  It  is  not  our  intention</span><span>  on  the  present  occasion  to  comment  on</span><span>  the  fallacies  and  puerilities  promulgated</span><span>  at  that  meeting  ;  it  is  sufficient  for  our</span><span>  purpose  to  know  that  it  turned  out  a  com-</span><span>  plete  failure.  There  was  scarcely  a  man,</span><span>  whose  opinions  usually  have  any  weight</span><span>  with  the  colonists  that  attended  it.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Report  of  the  Transportation  Com-</span><span>  mittee  was  brought  up  on  the  31st  ultimo  ;</span></p> <p><span>  it  is  founded  on  the  evidence  of  such  men</span></p> <p><span>  as  -Mr.  B.  Boyd,  Dr.  Dobie,  Mr.  Duguid,</span><span>  Major  Childs,  Mr.  J.  P.  Robinson,  Mr.</span><span>  Miles,  Commissioner  of  Police,  Mr.  C.  D.</span><span>  Logan,  Mr.  Timothy  Nowlan,  and  Mr.  E.  S.</span><span>  Hall,  gentlemen  who  from  their  wealth,  in-</span><span>  telligence,  and  practical  experience  of  the</span><span>  wants  of  the  colony,  are  fully  entitled  to</span><span>  our  respect,  and  whose  opinions  will  ne-</span><span>  cessarily  have  great  weight  both  here  and</span><span>  in  England.  It  is  not  in  our  power  to</span></p> <p><span>  furnish  our  readers  with  even  an  outline</span><span>  of  the  voluminous  documents  presented  to</span><span>  the  Council  by  the  Committee.  We  shall</span><span>  merely  offer  a  few  remarks  on  the  Report</span></p> <p><span>  itself.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Committee  have  recommended  that</span><span>  Mr.  Gladstone's  plan  for  the  revival  of</span><span>  transportation  should  be  accepted  on  the</span><span>  following  conditions-and  upon  no  other  :</span></p> <p><span>  1st-  That  no  alteration  shall  be  made  in  the</span><span>  Constitutional  Act  5  and  6  Victoria,  c,  76,  except</span><span>  with  a  view  to  the  extension  of  the  elective  prin-</span><span>  ciple.  -</span></p> <p><span>  2nd-That  the  transportation  of  male  convicts</span><span>  be  accompanied-as  a  simultaneous  measure-with</span><span>  the  importation  of  an  equal  number  of  females,  to</span><span>  consist  of  female  convicts  as  far  as  they  exist,  and</span><span>  the  balance  to  be  made  up  of  female  immigrants.</span></p> <p><span>  3rd-That,  as  a  further  simultaneous  measure,</span><span>  such  transportation  be  accompanied  with  an  equal</span><span>  importation  of  free  immigrants,  as  nearly  as  pos-</span><span>  sible  in  equal  proportion  as  to  sexes.</span></p> <p><span>  4th-That  the  wives  and  families  of  all  convicts</span><span>  receiving  permanent  or  temporary  indulgencies,</span><span>  should  be  brought,  and  count  as  part  of  this  free</span><span>  immigration.</span></p> <p><span>  5th-That  no  fewer-than  five  thousand  male</span><span>  convicts  be  annually  deported  to  this  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  6th-That  the  convict  establishments  properly</span><span>  so  called,  such  as  Norfolk  Island,  Cockatoo  Island,</span><span>  ironed  or  road  gangs  of  criminals  under  colonial</span><span>  sentence,  &c,  &c,  be  maintained  as  heretofore  at</span><span>  the  cost  of  the  British  Treasury.</span></p> <p><span>  7th-That  two-thirds  of  the  expense  of  police,</span><span>  gaols,  and  the  criminal  administration  of  justice,</span><span>  be  paid  by  the  Home  Government,  but  that  on  the</span><span>  relinquishment  of  the  land  fund,  and  all  other</span><span>  revenues  or  droits  of  the  Crown  to  the  appropria-</span><span>  tion  of  the  Governor  and  Council,  the  whole  of  this</span><span>  branch  of  convict  expenditure  be  assumed  by  the</span><span>  colony,  with  a  view  to  aid  the  British  Government</span><span>  in  defraying  the  cost  of  the  free  immigration</span><span>  stipulated  for  in  the  second  and  third  conditions.</span></p> <p><span>  8th-That  in  order  to  ensure  due  permanency</span><span>  and  efficiency  in  the  regulations  to  be  provided  for</span><span>  the  government  and  discipline  of  convicts,  the  sole</span><span>  power  of  making  such  regulations  be  vested  in  the</span><span>  Governor  and  Legislative  Council,  saving  entire</span><span>  the  Royal  prerogative  of  mercy.</span></p> <p><span>  The  description  of  convicts,  in  the  opinion  of</span><span>  your  Committee,  the  colony  should  agree  to  re-</span><span>  ceive  from  the  mother  country,  on  the  above  con-</span></p> <p><span>  ditions,  are  :-</span></p> <p><span>  1st-Young  delinquents  who  have  committed</span><span>  first  offences  after  little  or  no  probation.</span></p> <p><span>  2nd-Convicts  who  have  committed  graver,</span><span>  offences,  after  a  probation  considered  adequate  to</span><span>  the  crime  ;  the  probation  meant  being  probation</span><span>  under  the  separate  system.</span></p> <p><span>  3rd-Convicts  at  the  commencement  of  their</span><span>  sentences,  who  have  committed  various  crimes.</span></p> <p><span>  4th-If  any  convicts  be  received  from  Van</span><span>  Diemen's  Land,  convicts  with  tickets-of-leave.</span></p> <p><span>  The  foregoing  propositions  are  well</span><span>  worthy  the  attention  of  every  well-wisher</span><span>  of  his  adopted  country.  Should  the  terms</span><span>  be  accepted  by  the  Government,  we  feel</span><span>  satisfied  that  the  very  men  who  are  now  so</span></p> <p><span>  violently  opposed  to  the  introduction  of</span></p> <p><span>  .convict-labour  will  be  the  first  to  avail</span></p> <p><span>  themselves  of  it  when  it  reaches  our  shores.</span></p> <p><span>  We  shall  recur  to  this  subject  in  a  future</span></p> <p><span>  number.</span></p> <p><span>  RAMS.-On  Saturday,  seventy  five  pure-bred</span><span>  Merino  rams,  the  property  of  the  Messrs.  Leslie,</span><span>  of  Canning  Downs,  were  landed  from  the  steamer.</span><span>  They  have  been  selected  from  the  flocks  of  Mr.</span><span>  Macarthur.  Owing  to  the  long  passage  made  by</span><span>  the  steamer,  they  arrived  in  rather  poor  condition.</span><span>  One  of  them  died  on  board.  They  have  been</span><span>  forwarded  to  their  destination.</span></p> <p><span>  LEGISLATIVE  COUNCIL.--The  Council  was</span><span>  prorogued  on  Saturday  the  31st,  until  the  15th</span><span>  December  next,  by  His  Excellency  the  Governor,</span><span>  in  person.  Further  particulars  in  our  next.</span></p> <p><span>  STATE  OF  TRADE  AND  THE  WEATHER:  During</span><span>  the  week  we  have  had  very  heavy  falls  of  rain,</span><span>  which  has  filled  all  the  water-holes  in  the  neigh-</span><span>  bourhood  of  the  town.  All  retail  trade  has  been</span></p> <p><span>  in  consequence,  rather  dull,  purchasers  not  caring</span><span>  to  venture  out,  unless,  for  absolute  necessaries.</span><span>  The  storekeepers  are  complaining  at  the  present</span><span>  time  of  afflictions  for  which  there  seems  no  ready</span><span>  cure.  One  class  complains  that  the  unfortunate</span><span>  statement  of  the  Colonial  Secretary,  alluded  to  at</span><span>  the  public  meeting,  has  annihilated  all  their  hopes</span><span>  of  doing  business,  and  stand  behind  their  counters</span><span>  sickening  with  hope  deferred  ;  the  fall  in  wool  also</span><span>  having  rendered  the  patronage  of  the  squatters  as</span><span>  barren  as  priests'  charity.  A  second  class  com-</span><span>  plains  that  their  accounts  (among  which,  by  the</span><span>  bye,  are  our  own,)  ""  come  in  awful  ;""  meaning,</span><span>  we  presume,  that  either  they  do  not  come  in  at</span></p> <p><span>  all,  or  very  slowly.  They  must,  however,  cheer</span><span>  up  ;  there  are  good  times  in,  store  for  us  yet.</span></p> <p><span>  COURT  OF  QUARTER  SESSIONS.-We  stated  some</span><span>  time  ago  it  was  expected  that  a  Court  of  Quarter</span><span>  Sessions  would  be  established  in  Brisbane  on  or  about  January  next.  We  have  since  learned  that,</span></p> <p><span>  notwithstanding  the  vote  of  the  Legislative  Council  making  provision  for  the  salaries  of  the  neces-</span></p> <p><span>  sary  officers,  the  Court  cannot  be  opened  in  con-</span><span>  sequence  of  the  Jury  Act  not  having  been  extended</span><span>  to  this  district.  It  is  also  a  matter  of  doubt</span><span>  whether,  the  Police  Magistrate  can  act  as  Chair-</span><span>  man,  unless  a  special  Act  of  Council  is  passed  for</span><span>  that  purpose  ;  as  we  have  always  understood  that</span><span>  a  Chairman  of  Quarter  Sessions  must  be  a  bar-</span></p> <p><span>  rister  of  three  years'  standing.  Perhaps  some  of</span><span>  our  legal  friends  will  enlighten  us  upon  the  point,</span><span>  if  our  opinion  is  erroneous.  A  Court  of  Quarter</span><span>  Sessions  for  this  district  is  very  much  wanted</span><span>  and  the  sooner  the  impediments  to  their  being</span><span>  established  (whatever  they  may  be)  are  removed,</span><span>  the  better  for  the  inhabitants.</span></p> <p><span>  BUOYS,  CHAINS,  AND  ANCHORS.-We  observe</span><span>  by  the  Government  Gazette  of  the  13th  instant,</span><span>  that  tenders  will  be  received  at  the  Colonial  Secre-</span><span>  tary's  Office  until  twelve  o'clock  of  Monday  the</span><span>  30th,  November  for  supplying  one  iron-bouy,  8</span><span>  feet  by  6  feet  with  a  beacon  ;  two  iron  buoys  7</span><span>  feet  by  5  feet  ;  fifteen  fathoms  of  5/8  inch  chain,</span></p> <p><span>  and  two  mushroom  anchors  for  each  buoy  with</span><span>  swivels,  and  shackles.  The  tenders  to  be  endorsed</span><span>  ""Tenders  for  Buoys,  &c.,""  may  include  the  ex-</span><span>  pense  of  conveyance  to  Moreton  Bay,  or  the</span><span>  articles  only.

It  is</span><span>  said  that  owing  to  the  fall  in  England,  fortunes</span><span>  will.be  lost  on  last  year',s  purchases.  On.the  13th</span><span>  instant  skins  were  sold  at  4  1/2d.,  4  3/4d.,  and  6d.  per</span><span>  lb.,  and  are  fully  20  per  cent,  less  than  last  week.</span></p> <p><span>  Tallow  is  to  be  purchased  at  former  rates.

The  prices</span><span>  of  sugar,  tea,  brandy,  and:  rum  have  not  varied</span><span>  since  our  last  report.  On  the  30th  ult.,  at  Hobart</span><span>  Town  wheat  was  sold  at  5s.  6d.  to  5s.  9d.  ;  flour</span><span>  was  £14  per  ton.  At  Launceston  oh  the  same</span><span>  date,  wheat  was  quoted  at  5s.  per.  bushel.

The</span><span>  steamer  put  into  Bustard  Bay,  where  there  is  no</span><span>  shelter  tor  shipping,  it  being  apparently  a  large</span><span>  flat,  with  nine  feet  water  close  in  shore.  On  land-</span><span>  ing,  the  party  found  a  large  fresh  water  lagoon</span><span>  near  the  beach,  but  no  indication  of  the  vicinity</span><span>  of  any  river.  They  then  visited  Rodd's  Bay,</span></p> <p><span>  about  ten  or  twelve  miles  to  the  southward  of  Port</span><span>  Curtis,  which  is  a  very  fine  harbour,  and  easy  of</span><span>  access.  The  country  was  very  hilly  and  openly</span><span>  timbered,  but  no  fresh  water  was  found  near  the</span><span>  shore.  When  the  steamer  went  into  Port  Curtis,</span><span>  they  found  a  tide  running  at  the  rate  of  six  or</span><span>  seven  miles  an  hour,  and  on  passing  through  the</span><span>  heads,  anchored  in  one  of  the  finest  harbours</span><span>  hitherto  known  on  the  Australian  coasts,  with</span><span>  room  enough  for  the  British  fleet  to  manouvre.</span><span>  The  depth  of  water  varied  from  two  to  eleven</span><span>  fathoms.  Colonel  Barney  and  party  went  into</span><span>  every  creek  they  could  find,  and  landed  on  several</span><span>  islands,  but,  we  regret  to  add,  that  in  these  places</span><span>  also  their  researches  for  fresh  water  were  fruitless.</span><span>  The  banks  of  the  creeks  running  into  Port  Curtis  are</span><span>  thickly  covered  with  mangroves,  as  well  as  the</span><span>  shores  of  the  Bay.  A  great  many  of  the  natives</span><span>  were  seen  ;  one  of  them  asked  for  flour  ;  they</span><span>  had  evidently  been  in  communication  with  white</span><span>  people  before  ;  and  it  is  more  than  probable  that</span><span>  come  of  the  numerous  whaling  vessels  occasionally</span><span>  put  into  Port  Curtis  for  spars.  Numerous  pieces</span><span>  of  timber  were  observed  strewed  about  the  beach</span><span>  in  the  harbour,  which,  doubtless,  were  portions  of</span><span>  wrecks  that  had  drifted  in  with  the  tide.  It  is</span><span>  very  much  to  be  regretted  that  the  party  was</span><span>  compelled  to  return  without  having  solved  the</span><span>  problem  respecting  the  outlet  of  the  Boyne  River.</span><span>  A  gentleman  of  great  practical  experience  has</span><span>  given  it  as  his  opinion,  that  the  large  body  of</span><span>  back  water  rushing  through  the  entrance  to  Port</span><span>  Curtis  might  occasion  the  strong  tide  which  the</span><span>  steamer  experienced.  We  are  not  sufficiently  well</span><span>  acquainted  with  the  subject  to  controvert  this</span><span>  opinion.  We  have  good  reasons,  however,  for</span><span>  thinking  differently.  It  will  be  in  the  recollection</span><span>  of  many  of  our  readers,  that  some  few  years  back,</span><span>  a  man  named  Bracefield,  who  escaped  from  this</span><span>  place  when  it  was  a  penal  settlement,  was  disco-</span><span>  vered,  with  the  blacks  by  Mr.  A.  Petrie  of  this</span><span>  town,  when  he  was  on  a  boating  excursion  in  the</span><span>  neighbourhood  of  Wide  Bay.  Mr.  Petrie  being</span><span>  anxious  to  obtain  information  respecting  the  rivers</span><span>  on  the  coast,  questioned  Bracefield  about  the  Boyne</span><span>  when  he  was  told  that  a  very  large  river  disem-</span><span>  bogued  about,  as  near  us  he  could  judge,  fifty</span><span>  miles  to  the  northward  of  Wide  Bay  ;  that  its</span><span>  mouth  was  near  the  base  of  a  very  high  conical</span><span>  mountain,  (Query-Mount  Ovens  ?)  standing</span><span>  in  solitary  grandeur,  and  which  could  be</span><span>  seen  from  a  great  distance  inland.  Now  it</span><span>  so  happens,  that  a  mountain  similar  to</span><span>  that  described  by  Bracefield  was  seen  near  the</span><span>  coast  at  Port  Curtis,  and  there  is  every  reason  to</span><span>  believe  that  the  river  alluded  to  by  him  is  the</span><span>  Boyne.  Moreover,  Bracefield  stated  that  the  tide</span><span>  was  very  strong  at  the  mouth-a  fact  which  has</span><span>  since  been  confirmed  by  experience.  It  is  more</span><span>  than  probable  that,  if  Colonel  Barney  had  been</span><span>  made  acquainted  with  these  particulars,  the  result</span><span>  of  the  expedition  might  have  turned  out  more</span></p> <p><span>  favourable.</span></p> <p><span>  APPOINTMENT.-His  Honor  the  Chief  Justice</span><span>  has  been  pleased  to  appoint  Robert  Little,  of</span><span>  Moreton  Bay,  Esquire,  a  Commissioner  of  the</span><span>  Supreme  Court  of  New  South  Wales.</span></p> <p><span>  NEW  MAGISTRATE.-His  Excellency  the  Go-</span><span>  vernor  has  been  pleased  to  appoint  Henry  Hughes,</span><span>  Esq.,  of  Gowrie,  Darling  Downs,  to  be  a</span><span>  magistrate  of  the  territory  and  its  dependencies.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  BARAMBA  CREEK.-As  everything  relating</span><span>  to  the  Boyne  River  and  its  tributaries,  now  being,</span><span>  rapidly  stocked,  is  highly  interesting  and  impor-</span></p> <p><span>  tant,  we  subjoin  the  following  particulars  respect-</span><span>  ing  a  splendid  tract  of  country  to  the  north-east</span></p> <p><span>  of  Mr.  Friel's  station  at  Burrandowan,  on  the</span><span>  banks  of  the  Boyne.  The  Baramba  is  the  native</span><span>  name  of  a  very  large  creek  which  runs  in  a  pa-</span><span>  rallel  line  with  the  Stuart  River,  and  which  flows</span><span>  into  the  Boyne  about  forty  miles  below  the  Stuart.</span><span>  The  country  on  the  banks  of  the  Baramba  is</span><span>  clothed  with  the  richest  grass  and  herbage,  and  it</span><span>  has  been  already  ascertained  that  five  smaller</span><span>  creeks  pour  their  waters  into  its  ample  basins.</span><span>  The  discoverer  of  the  Baramba,  Mr.  Russell,</span><span>  named  it  the  Gulf  Stream,  from  the  circumstance</span><span>  of  his  having  come  upon  a  large  and  apparently</span><span>  deep  sheet  of  water,  with  banks  of  perpendicular</span><span>  rocks,  upwards  of  150  feet  high  ;  presenting  to</span><span>  the  eye  a  truly  romantic  and  wild  specimen  of</span><span>  Australian  scenery.  The  country  in  the  neigh-</span><span>  bourhood  of  this  gulf  is  very  rugged  and  broken,</span><span>  rendering  it  difficult  to  traverse  On  horseback.</span><span>  About  fifteen  miles  from  the  source  of  the  Baramba</span><span>  at  Craig  Range,  is  Messrs.  Borthwick  and  Oliver's</span><span>  new  station,  and,  we  believe,  those  gentleman  have</span><span>  good  reason  to  be  satisfied  with  the  country  they</span><span>  have  selected  for  depasturing  their  flocks  and</span><span>  herds-it  is  well  adapted  for  both.  The  nearest</span></p> <p><span>  station  to  Messrs.  Borthwick  and  Oliver  is  that</span><span>  of  Messrs.  Ferriter  and  Uhr,  who  have  lately  sent</span><span>  a  large  number  of  sheep  there.  Mr.  Corfield,</span><span>  who  has  a  temporary  station  between  the  runs  of</span><span>  the  parties  above  mentioned,  intends  removing  his</span><span>  flocks  to  beyond  the  station  of  Messrs.  Ferriter</span><span>  and  Uhr,  immediately.  From  the  last  out-station</span><span>  to  Brisbane,  the  distance,  as  the  crow  flies,  is  about</span><span>  150  miles,  and  it  is  generally  supposed  that  a  good</span><span>  road  to  Messrs.  Graham  and  Ivory's,  or  Mr.  Bal-</span><span>  fours  stations,  might  be  found  without  much  dif-</span><span>  ficulty.  Should  this  be  accomplished,  the  distance</span><span>  from  the  township  to  the  confluence  of  the  Ba-</span><span>  ramba  will  not  exceed  170  miles.  About  fifty</span><span>  miles  from  its  source,  the  creek  is  about  thirty</span><span>  yards  in  breadth,  and  the  water,  which  flows  over</span><span>  a  sandy  bed  with  innumerable  mud-flats,  richly</span><span>  grassed  in  dry  seasons,  is  described  as  being  very</span><span>  soft,  .and  admirably  adapted  for  sheep-washing  ;</span><span>  in  fact,  the  water  in  this  part  of  the  country  is  of</span><span>  the  best  and  purest  quality.  Several  of  the  water-</span></p> <p><span>  holes  are  upwards  of  a  mile  in  length,  and  very</span><span>  deep.  The  ridges  are  sound,  and  lightly  timbered</span><span>  with  broad-leaved  dwarf  iron-bark  and  apple-tree.</span><span>  There  are  also  numerous  apple-tree  and  gum  flats,</span><span>  but  these  localities  are  not  so  well  adapted  for</span><span>  grazing  purposes.  As  it  usually  happens,  the</span><span>  heads  of  the  creeks  have  been  found  to  be  the</span><span>  most  eligible  spots  for  stations.  The  distance</span><span>  between  the  Baramba,  or  Gulf  Stream,  and  the</span><span>  Stuart,  is  about  twenty  miles  ;  and  from  the  Ba-</span><span>  ramba  to  the  coast,  it  is  supposed  to  be  about  sixty</span><span>  or  seventy  miles.  A  gentleman  recently  arrived</span><span>  from  the  Baramba  informed  us  that  they  have  had</span><span>  but  little  rain  there  lately  ;  there  was,  notwith-</span><span>  standing,  plenty  of  water  everywhere.  The  natives</span><span>  have  not  made  any  attempt  to  molest  the  new</span><span>  settlers.  We  learn  that  upwards  of  sixty  thousand</span><span>  sheep  from  the  southward  are  on  their  way  to  the</span><span>  Boyne  ;  and  there  is  every  probability  that  after</span><span>  the  shearing  has  been  completed,  a  grand  rush</span><span>  will  be  made  for  the  newly-discovered  country  by</span><span>  our  enterprising  and  adventurous  squatters.</span></p> <p><span>  A  West  Indian  contemporary  publishes  this</span><span>  pithy  and  unquestionable  axiom  :</span></p> <p><span>  The  man  that  in  the  world  would  rise,</span><span>  Must  take  the  news  and  advertise.</span></p> ",Article,1846-11-28,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

"<p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  MORETON  BAT  COURIER.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  DECEMBER  5,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  admitted  by  all  the  opponents  of  the</span><span>  transportation  system,  that  there  is  an</span><span>  urgent  demand  for  labour-that  it  is  ab-</span><span>  solutely  necessary  we  should  be  supplied</span><span>  from  some  source  ;  and  yet  amongst  all</span><span>  those  persons  who  are  so  clamorous  against</span><span>  it,  not  one  has  pointed  out  any  feasible</span><span>  plan  whereby  our  wants  can  be  adequately</span><span>  relieved.  Some,  it  is  true,  have  proposed</span><span>  that  a  loan  should  be  raised  in  England</span><span>  to  meet  the  cost  of  free  immigration  ;  but</span><span>  we  would  ask  where  is  the  security  to</span><span>  come  from  ?  Will  the  capitalists  in  the</span><span>  metropolis  come  forward  at  their  own</span><span>  personal  risk  and  give  that  security  ?  We</span><span>  opine  not.  They  have  had  quite  sufficient</span><span>  experience  as  regards  the  withdrawal  of</span><span>  the  trading  capital  of  the  colony  for</span><span>  emigration  purposes,  some  few  years  back,</span><span>  to  admit  of  their  entering  into  any  such</span><span>  engagements  in  future.  Even  allowing,</span><span>  for  the  sake  of  argument,  that  monied</span><span>  men  were  willing  to  co-operate  with  the</span><span>  squatters-the  great  employers  of  labour</span><span>  in  this  colony-where  are  the  labourers</span><span>  to  come  from  ?  Surely  the  pseudo  moral-</span><span>  ists  and  philanthropists  at  the  Market</span><span>  street  meeting  must  be  grossly  ignorant  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  real  state  of  the  labour  market-in</span><span>  England,  or  they  would  not  have  at-</span><span>  tempted  to  oppose  the  introduction  of</span><span>  convict-labour  under  the  terms  proposed</span><span>  by  the  Legislative  Council.  It  is  a  posi-</span><span>  tive  fact,  that  the  depression  in  the  value</span><span>  of  shares  in  railways  now  being  con-</span><span>  structed  in  England,  is  to  be  attributed  to</span><span>  the  scarcity  of  labourers.  In  a  recent</span><span>  number  of  the  Railway  Chronicle,  it  is</span><span>  stated  that  if  Parliament  were  to  pass  one</span><span>  fifth  part  of  the  Railway  Bills  during  the</span><span>  session,  the  construction  of  many  of  them</span><span>  would  be  impossible,  owing  to  there  being</span></p> <p><span>  no  hands  to  work  them.  The  article  to</span><span>  which  we  allude  shows  so  clearly  the  state</span><span>  of  the  labour  market  in  England,  that  we</span><span>  have  extracted  the  following  for  the  in</span></p> <p><span>  formation  of  our  readers  :-</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  obtained  returns  from  about  500  miles</span><span>  of  railways  now  under  construction,  and  we  find</span><span>  that  on  them  there  are  now  employed  29,000  men</span><span>  and  3000  horses.  This  amount  comprehends</span><span>  one-fourth  part  only  of  the  lines  now  in  progress</span><span>  of  construction  ;  therefore  we  may  assume  120,000</span><span>  men  and  12,000  horses  are  the  total  number  em-</span><span>  ployed.  The  wages  paid  for  these  men  and  horses</span><span>  is  £500,000  per  week,or  £26,000,000  per  annum,</span><span>  directly  expended  on  railway  wages.</span></p> <p><span>  This  consists  of  wages  merely  for  men  directly</span><span>  employed  on  the  line.  Half  as  much  again  is</span><span>  expended  indirectly  on  labour,  preparing  rails,</span><span>  chairs,  stocks,  &c,  for  the  line,  and  on  land  and</span><span>  other  materials  as  much  more.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  stated  that  on  500  miles  we  have  re-</span><span>  turns  of  29,000  men  and  3000  horses  employed.</span><span>  But  this  is  not  the  proper  quantity  required  for</span><span>  the  labour.  We  have  before  us  the  engineers'</span><span>  returns,  by  which  we  find  that  they  require,  in</span><span>  order  to  complete  the  work  in  time,  an  additional</span><span>  supply  of  nearly  20,000,  or  that  48,00.0;  men  and</span><span>  5000  horses  are  the  proper  numbers  that  should</span><span>  be  employed.  Moreover,  we  find  that  these  addi-</span><span>  tional  men  must  be  had  in  order  to  do  the  work</span><span>  already  stipulated.  These  additional  men  cannot</span><span>  be  obtained,  and  the  very  attempt  to  obtain  them</span><span>  would  merely  have  the  effect  of  enhancing  the</span><span>  cost  of  the  present  hands,  without  materially  in-</span><span>  creasing  the  supply.</span></p> <p><span>  We  see,  therefore,  that  the  present  supply  of</span><span>  hands  is  deficient-that  any  attempt  to  increase  the</span><span>  supply  would  fail,  because  it  would  enhance  prices</span><span>  beyond  all  possibility  of  profitable  investment.</span><span>  We  do  not  believe,  as  an  eminent  engineer  has</span><span>  stated,  that  present  prices  are  50  per  cent,  dearer</span><span>  than  this  time  last  year.  This  is  an  exaggeration.</span><span>  Prices  are  however,  kept  down  only  by  the  wisdom</span><span>  which  has  hitherto  moderated  the  demand  to  the</span><span>  means  of  supply.  Let  us  have  an  injudicious  in-</span><span>  crease  of  demand,  and  prices  will  at  once  become</span><span>  preposterous.</span></p> <p><span>  The  prospect,  therefore,  of  bringing  into  the</span><span>  railway  labour  market,  which  already  makes  a</span><span>  demand  of  £26,000,000  per  annum,  a  demand  of</span><span>  40,  50,  or  100  millions,  with  which  we  are  now</span><span>  threatened,  will  simply  be  to  paralyse  all  means</span><span>  of  exertion-to  bring  to  a  stand-still  all  the  lines</span><span>  in  progress,  as  well  as  those  in  prospect.  The</span><span>  effect  on  the  prosperity  of  the  country  will  be</span><span>  two-fold-an  unprecedented  demand  for  money,</span><span>  a  general  paralysis  of  labour.  The  labourer  will</span><span>  be  striking  for  all  wages  and  no  work  ;  the  specu-</span><span>  lator  steering  on  all  expenditure  and  no  returns.</span><span>  The  work  will  stand  still,  but  interest  of  expendi-</span><span>  ture  and  remunerating  investment  will  go  on.</span><span>  Bills  become  due  with  even  greater  certainty  than</span><span>  dividends.</span></p> <p><span>  With  these  facts  staring  us  in  the  face,</span><span>  it  is  the  height  of  folly  to  expect  that</span><span>  emigration  can  be  resumed,  for  several</span><span>  years  to  come,  on  a  sufficiently  extensive</span><span>  scale  to  supply  our  increasing  demand  for</span><span>  labour.  The  Home  Government  knowing</span><span>  that  the  want  of  labourers  is  sensibly  felt</span><span>  throughout  the  United  Kingdom,  are  not</span><span>  likely  to  resort  to  the  bounty  system,  when</span><span>  the  population  is  already  more  than  fully</span><span>  employed  on  railways,  and  in  the  agricul-</span></p> <p><span>  tural  districts.</span></p> <p><span>  From  the  evidence  of  the  witnesses  ex-</span></p> <p><span>  amined  by  the  Transportation  Committee,</span></p> <p><span>  we  learn  that  the  number  of  labourers</span></p> <p><span>  immediately  required  by  the  colonists  is</span><span>  upwards  of  10,000.  To  introduce  this</span><span>  number  into  the  colony,  it  would  require</span><span>  the  sum  of  £200,000,  being  a  fourth  part</span><span>  of  the  specie  in  all  the  banks,  and  equal</span><span>  to  the  whole  circulating  medium.  To</span><span>  send  that  sum  of  money  out  of  the  colony</span><span>  would  be  a  suicidal  act,  and  would  be</span><span>  attended  with  the  greatest  inconvenience,</span><span>  and  perhaps  ruin,  to  many  of  the  em-</span><span>  ployers  of  labour.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  not  our  intention  to  dwell  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  immense  importance  of  our  having  a  con-</span><span>  tinuous  stream  of  emigration  to  these</span><span>  shores-it  must  be  obvious  to  every  one  ;</span><span>  and  we  consider  that  those  persons  who  so</span><span>  pertinaciously  endeavour  to  throw  obsta-</span><span>  cles  in  the  way  of  its  accomplishment,  are</span><span>  guilty  of  the  most  egregious  folly-they</span><span>  are  men  who,  like  the  Puritans  of  former</span><span>  times,  would  ""  hang  a  cat  on  a  Monday</span><span>  for  killing  a  mouse  on  a  Sunday.""  It</span><span>  must  not  be  supposed  however,  that  the</span><span>  assemblies  which  have  been  got  together</span><span>  for  the  consideration  of  this  important</span><span>  subject,  have  been  of  the  nature  of  public</span><span>  meetings  ;  besides  being  meagrely  attend-</span><span>  ed,  they  have  all  been  of  a  character  pre-</span><span>  cluding  all  possibility  of  discussion.  In</span><span>  fact,  the  speakers  treated  it  as  a  moral  and</span><span>  religious  question,  and  not  as  what  it</span><span>  really  is,  a  question  for  the  political  eco-</span><span>  nomist  to  decide.  It  is  all  very  well  for</span><span>  people  in  towns,  who  know  little  or  no-</span><span>  thing  about  the  bush,  to  prate  about  the</span><span>  contaminating  influence  of  this  class  of</span><span>  men  and  the  other  :  such  speeches  may</span><span>  have  the  effect  of  frightening  old  women</span><span>  and  children,  but  they  will  not  take  well</span><span>  with  ""  children  of  a  larger  growth.""</span><span>  These  meetings  are,  therefore,  worthless,</span><span>  as  an  indication  of  public  opinion  ;  they</span><span>  are,  however,  of  great  value,  as  showing</span><span>  the  utter  imbecility  and  helplessness  of</span><span>  the  anti-transportation  party.  Such  is</span><span>  their  feeling  against  the  introduction  of</span><span>  convict  labour,  that  they  are  startled,  be-</span><span>  wildered,  and  .angry-afraid  of  everything</span><span>  and  everybody-afraid  of  the  Government</span></p> <p><span>  -afraid  of  the  Council-afraid  of  Mr.</span><span>  Wentworth,  and,  above  all,  afraid  of</span><span>  themselves.  Of  course,  they  are  unani-</span><span>  mous  in  abusing  the  pro  -transportationists  ;</span><span>  but  they  do  not  seem  to  agree  any  farther.</span></p> <p><span>  Among  the  mass  of  valuable  evidence,</span><span>  upon  which  the  Report  of  the  Transporta-</span><span>  tion  Committee  is  founded,  that  of  Mr.</span><span>  Boyd  is  best  deserving  of  attention.  His</span><span>  opinion  is  decidedly  in  favour  of  the  re-</span><span>  sumption  of  transportation,  under  the</span><span>  condition  that  the  men  should  be  landed</span></p> <p><span>  at  Portland,  Twofold  Bay,  and  Moreton</span><span>  Bay-thus  avoiding  the  large  towns,</span><span>  where  their  labour  is  not  so  urgently  re-</span><span>  quired,  and  where  they  would  be  in  dan-</span><span>  ger  of  renewing  their  former  habits  Mr.</span><span>  Boyd  bears  testimony  to  the  usefulness</span><span>  and  good  conduct  of  the  ticket-of-leave</span><span>  holders  in  his  employ,  and  says  that  he</span><span>  would  greatly  prefer  that  class  of  men,</span><span>  unless  the  future  selection  of,  immigrants</span><span>  are  of  a  character  different  to  what  he  has</span></p> <p><span>  been  accustomed.  We  coincide  entirely</span><span>  with  this  opinion,  and  to  prove  that  it  is</span><span>  correct,  we  Have  only  to  refer  to  the</span><span>  general  good  conduct  of  persons  of  the</span><span>  same  class  in  this  district.  In  the  two</span><span>  districts,  there  are  at  the  present  time  231</span><span>  ticket-of-leave  .holders,  and  during  the</span></p> <p><span>  last  twelve  months,,  not  one  has  been  de-</span><span>  prived  of  his  privilege,  nor  has  there  been</span><span>  one  conviction,  as  far  as  we  know,  for</span><span>  felony  or  misdemeanour.  We  would</span><span>  strongly  recommend  that  the  labourers,</span><span>  when  they  arrive  here,  should  be  provided</span></p> <p><span>  with  some  document  similar  to  a  ticket</span><span>  of-leave,  and  that  it  should  be  registered</span><span>  by  the  Bench  of  Magistrates.</span></p> <p><span>  We  learn  from  the  evidence  of  Mr.</span><span>  Sprott,  of  Port  Phillip,  that  the  Emigra-</span><span>  tion  Society,  at  Geelong,  have  imported,</span><span>  during  the  last  two  years,  upwards  of  700</span><span>  expirees,  or  persons  with  conditional  par-</span><span>  dons-they  were  the  refuse  of  Van  Die-</span><span>  men's  Land,  are  great  vagabonds,  and  a</span></p> <p><span>  wretched  class  of  men.  The  Pentonville</span></p> <p><span>  Exiles,  on  the  contrary,  have  turned  out  to</span><span>  be  the  best  class  of  men  the  settlers  have</span><span>  ever  had  ;  and,  as  a  body,  superior  to  the</span><span>  immigrants  sent  from  home.  About  280</span><span>  have  been  landed,  and  they  have  proved  a</span><span>  valuable  acquisition  to  that  district.  The</span><span>  Exiles  are  a  young  and  hardy  class  of</span><span>  men,  ranging  from  eighteen  to  twenty</span><span>  eight  or  thirty  years  of  age.</span></p> <p><span>  Similar  testimony  has  been  furnished</span><span>  by  the  other  witnesses  ;  and  yet,  in  the</span><span>  face  of  all  these  facts,  we  find  that  some  of</span><span>  the  colonists  are  objecting  to  the  importa-</span><span>  tion  of  picked  and  well-behaved  prisoners</span><span>  from  England,  at  the  expense  of  the  Home</span></p> <p><span>  Government  !

"<p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  SEPTEMBER  26,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  close  of  the  first  quarter  of  its</span><span>  existence,  the  Courier  offers  its  salutation</span><span>  to  its  numerous  readers,  and  the  families</span><span>  where  it  has  been  a  frequent,  and,  it  is  to</span><span>  be  hoped,  not  unwelcome  visitant.</span></p> <p><span>  The  rapid  progress  of  society  in  civili-</span><span>  zation  and  the  arts,  the  speedy  communi-</span><span>  cation  and  frequent  intercourse  subsisting</span><span>  between  these  colonies  and  all  parts  of  the</span><span>  globe,  their  vast  extent  and  steady  ad-</span><span>  vancement,  the  busy  enterprise  of  its</span><span>  centre  of  power  and  intelligence  in</span><span>  England,  furnish  materials  far  ampler</span><span>  than  heretofore  for  the  weekly  journalist</span><span>  to  accumulate,  condense,  and  arrange.  It</span><span>  is  the  intention  of  the  proprietor  of  the</span><span>  Courier,  therefore,  to  keep  pace  with  the</span><span>  exigencies  of  the  times,  by  furnishing</span><span>  occasional  supplements,  so  as  to  compre-</span><span>  hend  the  extended  boundaries  of  informa-</span><span>  tion.  The  great  difficulty  experienced</span></p> <p><span>  throughout  the  colony  in  procuring  sup-</span><span>  plies  of  paper,  has  prevented  the  proprietor</span><span>  from  permanently  enlarging  the  journal  ;</span><span>  but  he  hopes  to  be  enabled  to  do  so  at  the</span><span>  end  of  the  year,  should  the  support,  which</span><span>  he  anticipates,  be  afforded  to  him.</span></p> <p><span>  In  discussing  the  ever  varying  topics  of</span><span>  the  day,  we  have  endeavoured  to  give  the</span><span>  most  correct  version  possible  of  every</span><span>  event,  but  distance,  and  various  other</span><span>  circumstances,  render  this  sometimes  diffi-</span><span>  cult  ;  for,  we  believe,  nothing  can  be</span><span>  more  injurious  to  a  paper  than  to  promul-</span><span>  gate  falsehood.  We  shall  apply  the</span><span>  philosophy  of  truth  to  every  subject,  con-</span></p> <p><span>  vinced  that  our  efforts  in  the  end  will  be</span><span>  crowned  with  success.  Another  cardinal</span><span>  principle  in  the  conduct  of  this  paper  we</span><span>  shall  endeavour  to  maintain,  is  the  right</span><span>  of  private  thought  and  action,  the  un-</span><span>  biassed  expression  of  our  opinions,  re-</span><span>  strained  only  by  the  proper  bounds  of</span><span>  moderation,  and  of  what  we  hold  to  be</span><span>  truth.  If  thus  we  can  support  the  good</span><span>  cause  in  which  we  are  engaged,  it  shall,</span><span>  have  our  support,  but  no  further.  A  more</span><span>  fleeting  and  fickle  popularity  may,  per-</span><span>  haps,  be  won  by  greater  subserviency  to</span><span>  party  and  to  local  prejudices,  and  to</span><span>  evanescent  interests  and  influences.  Such</span><span>  times-serving  management  we  have  striven</span><span>  to  avoid,  and  to  that  course  we  purpose  to</span><span>  adhere.  For  we  feel  confident  that  no</span></p> <p><span>  good  cause  can  be  usefully  aided  by  such</span><span>  means  ;  that  any  influence  which  a  journal</span><span>  can  exert,  to  be  useful  and  respected,  must</span><span>  be  voluntary  and  unfettered.  The  only</span></p> <p><span>  alliance  which  we  have  been  desirous  to</span><span>  maintain,  and  which  it  is  our  continued</span><span>  endeavour  to  perpetuate,  must  be  founded</span><span>  on  agreement  of  principle,  on  similarity</span><span>  of  sentiment  between  the  public  writer</span><span>  and  intelligent  men  in  other  stations  of</span><span>  life,  to  whom  it  is  his  business  to  com-</span><span>  municate  information,  and  between  whom</span><span>  and  the  journalist  there  is  consequently</span><span>  fostered  that  reciprocal  good  understand-</span><span>  ing  and  goodwill  which,  on  our  part,  we</span><span>  desire  at  the  end  of  this,  our  first  quarter,</span><span>  sincerely  to  express  to  all  who,  during  the</span><span>  period  it  has  been  in  existence,  have</span><span>  favoured  the  Courier  with  their  honourable</span><span>  and  valued  support.</span></p> <p><span>  AUSTRALIAN  BEEF.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  WE  can  never  look  beyond  the  colonial</span><span>  market  for  consumers  of  our  beef,""  is  a</span><span>  common  cry  with  a  class  of  men  happily</span><span>  and  aptly  termed  croakers,  who,  we  are</span><span>  sorry  to  say,  are  somewhat  numerous  even</span><span>  in  New  South  Wales.  These  look  upon</span><span>  anything  like  improvement  with  horror,</span></p> <p><span>  and  can  never  be  convinced  of  the  bene-</span><span>  ficial  effects  which  flow  from  well-directed</span></p> <p><span>  enterprise,  while  it  is  possible  to  be  scepti-</span><span>  cal.  ,  If  an  intelligent,  far-seeing  colonist,</span><span>  deviate  from  the  path,  long-trodden,  of</span><span>  established  usage,  and  disregard  the  set</span><span>  form  of  legitimate  enterprise-their  united</span><span>  tongues  clamour  at  what  they,  forsooth  !</span><span>  term  his  folly.  His  daring  conveys  a</span></p> <p><span>  tacit  condemnation  of  their  own  want  of</span></p> <p><span>  spirit  and  activity,  and  they  both  predict</span><span>  and  wish  his  failure.  Thus,  we  remember,</span><span>  the  cultivation  of  the  vine  was  derided</span></p> <p><span>  the  export  of  hides--the  making  of  gela-</span></p> <p><span>  tine-the  manufacture  of  tweeds-the</span></p> <p><span>  refinement  of  sugar.  Boiling  animals  to</span><span>  obtain  their  fat,  was  stigmatised  as  wanton</span><span>  waste  ;  and  as  for  salting  beef  for  expor-</span><span>  tation,  ask  a  croaker:-""  Sir,""  he  will</span><span>  answer  you,  ""  our  natural  grasses  have  no</span><span>  substance  ;  our  beef  must  be  eaten  fresh;</span><span>  or  it  is  worthless.  The  antiseptic  pro-</span><span>  perties  of  salt  certainly  prevent  putrifac-</span><span>  tion,  but  dry  up  at  the  same  time  both  fat</span><span>  and  juice.""  Such  an  opinion  was  cer-</span><span>  tainly  fortified  by  the  result  of  the  first</span><span>  shipments  to  England  :  badly  cured  and</span><span>  badly  packed,  when  they  arrived  the  con-</span><span>  tents  of  the  casks  were  fit  for  nothing  but</span><span>  manure.  That  this,  however,  was  not  a</span><span>  fair  test  of  the  qualities  of  Australian</span><span>  meat,  both  colonial  and  home  experience</span><span>  have  since  abundantly  proved.  Our  en-</span><span>  terprising  townsman,  Mr.  John  Campbell,</span><span>  has  at  this  moment  salted  beef  in  his</span><span>  possession,  which  he  cured  two  years  ago,</span><span>  and  which  is  even  now  perfectly  juicy  and</span><span>  sweet.  And  shipments  home  have  been</span><span>  made,  from  various  parts  of  the  colony,</span><span>  which  have  been  lately  advised  as  profita-</span><span>  ble.  The  secret  lies,  in  proper  curing  and</span><span>  packing  ;  and  no  man,  unless  thoroughly</span><span>  acquainted  with  these,  can  prudently</span><span>  engage  in  the  salting  of  meat,  either  for</span></p> <p><span>  home  or  colonial  markets.</span></p> <p><span>  We  feel  much  pleasure  in  quoting  the</span><span>  subjoined  from  a  Port  Phillip  contem-</span></p> <p><span>  porary  :</span></p> <p><span>  Messrs.  Watson  and  Wight  shipped  several</span><span>  tierces  of  Port  Phillip  beef  (killed  and  cured  under</span><span>  their  superintendence)  by  the  William  Stoveld,  in</span><span>  May,  1845,  and  their  speculation  has  been  crowned</span><span>  with  the  following  highly  satisfactory  advices,</span><span>  dated  25th  March,  from  their  London  brokers,</span><span>  respecting  the  complete  success  of  the  export  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""  We  have  to  report  upon  the  casks  of  beef,  and</span><span>  we  regret  the  party  we  employed,  who  is  considered</span><span>  one  of  the  best  judges  in  the  market,  has  deferred</span><span>  giving  it,  so  as  not  to  admit  of  our  sending  it  by</span><span>  an  earlier  opportunity.  It  appears  that  the  quality</span><span>  is  excellent,  equal  to  American,  which,  after  many</span><span>  difficulties,  is  in  high  favour,  and  is  gradually</span><span>  supplanting  the  Irish.  It  is  likely  the  Australian</span><span>  beef  will  have  to  undergo  the  same  severe  ordeal  to</span><span>  establish  its  character,  but  will  eventually  be  able</span><span>  to  compete  with  its  rival.

"<p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  OCTOBER  10,  1846.</span><span>  THE  UPSET  PRICE  OF  LAND.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  25th  of  September,  in  the  Legis-</span><span>  lative  Council,  Mr.  Lowe  brought  forward</span><span>  the  resolutions  of  which  he  had  given</span><span>  notice  respecting  the  present  Upset  Price</span><span>  of  Land,  which  were  :</span></p> <p><span>  1.  That  the  raising  the  upset  price  of  land,</span><span>  first  to  12s.,  and  afterwards  to  £1,  per  acre,  has</span></p> <p><span>  rendered  waste  land  unsaleable.</span></p> <p><span>  2.  That  while  this  price  is  maintained,  the</span><span>  squatting  question  can  never  be  settled  on  a  just</span><span>  and  satisfactory  basis.</span></p> <p><span>  3.  That  the  upset  price  of  land  ought  to  be</span><span>  reduced  to  a  sum  not  exceeding  its  value.</span></p> <p><span>  With  the  first  and  last  of  these  proposi-</span><span>  tions  we  entirely  agree,  but  with  regard</span><span>  to  the  second  our  opinions  widely  differ.</span><span>  Mr.  Lowe  in  his  very  eloquent  speech  on</span><span>  this  vitally  important  question,  argues</span><span>  against  the  leasing  system  on  the  ground</span><span>  that  the  lessees  would  sub-let,  and  the</span><span>  lands  would  be  covered  with  such  tenants,</span><span>  and  that  when  their  leases  expired  the</span><span>  Government  would  have  to  turn  them</span></p> <p><span>  out.  Mr.  Lowe  is  evidently  desirous  of</span><span>  checking  the  growth  of  squatting,  and</span><span>  talks  of  dangers  to  arise  from  the  leasing</span><span>  system,  which  never  had,  and  probably</span></p> <p><span>  £.  s.  d.</span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  2</span></p> <p><span>  8</span><span>  1</span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  never  will  have,  existence.  The  price  of</span><span>  land  has  little  to  do  with  the  squatting</span><span>  question,  and  any  reduction  in  the  price</span><span>  could  not  affect  the  interests  of  graziers,</span><span>  any  more  than  it  would  those  of  other</span><span>  classes  of  colonists.  .  The  occupation  of</span><span>  Crown  Lands  by  license  is  essential  to</span><span>  the  well-doing,  and  even  the  existence  of</span><span>  the  pastoral  community.  If  the  price  of</span></p> <p><span>  land  were,  reduced  to-morrow,  there  would</span><span>  still  be  the  same,  necessity  for  squatting,</span><span>  and  we  look  upon  any  attempt  to  check</span><span>  it  as  a  suicidal  act,  as  far  as  the  accele-</span><span>  rated  progress  of  the  colony  is  concerned.</span></p> <p><span>  The  real  grievance  the  colonists  have</span><span>  to  complain  of  is  the  enormous  price  of</span><span>  the  town  and  suburban  lots  of  lands,  as</span><span>  fixed  by  Sir  George  Gipps,  whose  impo-</span><span>  litic  regulations-whose  wretched  misrule</span><span>  —caused  land  sales  and  emigration  almost</span><span>  entirely  to  cease.  It  is  a  well-known</span><span>  fact  that  the  price  of  one  acre  of  land  in</span><span>  this  colony  is  ten  times  as  dear  as  one  at</span><span>  the  Cape  of  Good  Hope,  and  yet  one</span><span>  acre  there,  is,  according  to  a  report-fur-</span></p> <p><span>  nished  to  the  Government,  worth  three  in</span><span>  Australia.  .  In  order  to  draw  a  contrast,</span><span>  we  shall  state  the  upset  price  of  land  in</span><span>  the  following  colonies  :-</span></p> <p><span>  Lower  Canada....  0  4  11</span><span>  Elsewhere  in  ditto.  0  3  3</span><span>  New  Brunswick.....  0  2  8</span></p> <p><span>  Nova  Scotia  ..........  0  1  9</span><span>  Newfoundland....  0  2  0</span><span>  Cape  of  Good  Hope  ...  0  2  0</span></p> <p><span>  Australia......  1  0  0</span></p> <p><span>  From  which  it  appears  that  the  greater</span><span>  the  distance  from  home,  and,  of  course,</span><span>  the  greater  the  risk  and  expense  of  transit,</span><span>  the  dearer  Crown  Lands  become.  The</span><span>  author  of  ""  Six  Years'  Residence  in  the</span><span>  Australian  Colonies,""  says,  the  reason</span><span>  why  land  is  so  dear  in  this  colony  is  to</span><span>  be  attributed  to  the  following  cause  :—</span></p> <p><span>  When  the  Whigs  were  in  power,  they  granted</span><span>  a  large  portion  of  New  Holland  to  certain  of  their</span><span>  supporters,  under  the  designation  of  South  Aus-</span><span>  tralia.—At  that  time  land  was  selling  in  Australia</span><span>  at  half-a-crown  per  acre  ;  but  at  this  low  price  the</span><span>  job  would  not  be  a  profitable  one.  The  upset  price</span><span>  of  lands  was  therefore  raised  to  £  1  per  acre  ;  and</span><span>  in  order  to  put  all  Australia  on  the  same  footing,</span><span>  the  upset  price  of  Crown  lands  was  raised  to  the</span><span>  same  exorbitant  and  ruinous  rate  in  the  old  co-</span><span>  lonies.  The  consequence  has  been,  that  land  sales</span><span>  have  all  but  ceased  ;  and  in  order  to  prevent  more</span><span>  disastrous  results,  the  Government  were  obliged  to</span><span>  pay  the  debts  of  South  Australia,  and  take  the</span><span>  management  of  the  colony  into  their  own  hands.</span><span>  This  scheme  had  been  concocted  by  a  theoretical</span><span>  visionary,  called  Wakefield,  and  was  styled  the</span><span>  self-supporting  principle,  but,  like  other  bubbles,</span><span>  it  burst.  The  Governor  of  Western  Australia</span><span>  compared  the  result  of  this  hair-brained  scheme  to</span><span>  that  of  a  man  riding  at  full  gallop,  when  suddenly</span><span>  the  horse  stands  still,  and  the  rider  is  thrown  over</span><span>  his  head.  Land  sales  and  emigration  ceased.</span></p> <p><span>  The  present  absurd  price  of  land  in</span><span>  the  neighbourhood  of  the  townships  in</span><span>  this  District,  has  tended  more  than  any-</span><span>  thing  to  retard  our  prosperity,  and  yet</span><span>  we  find  the  system  of  high  rates  is  still</span><span>  continued,  and  that  land  is  only  doled</span><span>  out  in  small  quantities,  to  create  compe-</span><span>  tition  and  to  enhance  its  price.</span></p> <p><span>  We  shall  recur  to  this  subject  in  our</span></p> <p><span>  next.</span></p> ",Article,1846-10-10,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

It  was  in-</span><span>  tended  that  a  number  of  those  convicts</span><span>  who  had  reached  the  most  advanced,  that</span><span>  was,  the  lightest  stage  of  penal  discipline,</span><span>  should  go  to  that  colony,  where  they</span><span>  would  be  furnished  with  provisions  for  a</span><span>  limited  period,  and  also  a  portion  of  land.</span><span>  They  would  also  be  permitted,  if  they</span><span>  thought  proper,  after  a  certain  interval,</span><span>  to  emigrate  to  the  adjoining  colonies,  and</span><span>  become  the  servants  of  the  outlying  popu-</span><span>  lation  of  those  colonies.  The  class  of</span><span>  convicts  who  would  be  sent  to  this  new</span><span>  colony  would  be  those  who,  when  they</span><span>  arrived  there,  would  be  in  the  position  of</span><span>  having  received  a  conditional  pardon.""</span></p> <p><span>  Should  the  foregoing  plan  be  carried  out,</span><span>  it  cannot  fail  of  benefiting  the  free  settlers</span><span>  in  Van  Diemen's  Land,  because  it  will</span><span>  relieve  them  of  a  great  portion  of  the  con-</span><span>  vict  population,  for  whom  they  have  no</span><span>  employment  ;  at  the  same  time  the  parti-</span><span>  cular  advantages  likely  to  accrue  to  this</span><span>  district,  will  be  immediate  and  important,</span><span>  inasmuch  as  we  shall  be  able  to  procure</span><span>  adequate  supplies  of  labour,  and  also  an</span><span>  outlet  for  our  surplus  stock,  in  the  shape</span><span>  of  salt  provisions.  There  is  one  part  of</span><span>  the  plan,  however,  which  is  highly  ob-</span><span>  jectionable,  and  that  is  the  giving  land  to</span><span>  the  convicts,  thus  placing  them  in  a  much</span><span>  better  position  than  men  of  virtuous  cha-</span><span>  racter.  It  would  be  offering  a  premium</span><span>  to  vice,  and  tend  more  than  anything  to</span><span>  lower  the  standard  of  respectability  among</span><span>  the  free  settlers.  Moreover,  we  look  upon</span><span>  such  a  scheme  as  quite  impracticable,</span><span>  because  Government  would  have  to  supply</span><span>  them  with  agricultural  implements,  as  well</span><span>  as  stock,  for  it  is  not  to  be  supposed  that</span><span>  men  in  their  position  will  be  possessed  of</span><span>  the  requisite  capital  to  enable  them  to</span><span>  carry  out  the  mistaken  views  of  such  spe  -</span><span>  culative  philanthropists.</span></p> <p><span>  With  regard  to  the  place  where  the  new</span><span>  colony  is  to  be  formed,  all  the  reports  agree</span><span>  in  stating  that  it  will  not  be  within  the</span><span>  tropics.  So  little  is  known  of  the  coast</span><span>  to  the  northward  of  this  port,  that  it  is</span><span>  impossible  to  form  an  accurate  opinion  re-</span><span>  specting  the  eligibility  of  any  particular</span><span>  part  as  a  site  for  the  new  settlement.  It</span><span>  will,  no  doubt,  be  minutely  surveyed  be-</span><span>  fore  Government  decide  upon  a  subject  of</span><span>  such  magnitude.  It  has  been  stated  that</span><span>  there  was  a  probability  of  the  new  colony</span><span>  being  established  in  the  neighbourhood  of</span><span>  the  Boyne  River,  which  is  supposed  to</span><span>  fall  into  Rodd's  Bay  at  Port  Curtis,  about</span><span>  one  hundred  and  eighty  miles  from  this</span><span>  port.  This  place  is  the  natural  outlet  of</span><span>  most  extensive  and  beautiful  tracts  of</span><span>  country  ;  and  we  should  be  sorry  to  see  a</span><span>  penal  settlement  formed  there,  because  it</span><span>  might  possibly  be  the  means  of  prevent-</span><span>  ing  the  squatters,  at  some  future  period,</span><span>  from  taking  advantage  of  its  known  ca-</span><span>  pabilities  as  a  shipping  port.  Thirteen</span><span>  stations  have  already  been  taken  up  on</span><span>  the  Boyne  River  and  its  tributaries,  and</span><span>  it  is  more  than  probable  that  in  the  course</span><span>  of  another  year  upwards  of  forty  stations</span></p> <p><span>  will  be  formed  there.</span></p> <p><span>  Whatever  plan  may  ultimately  he  adopted</span><span>  in  forming  the  new  settlement  (not  strictly</span><span>  penal),  we  hope  and  trust  the  labour  of</span><span>  the  convicts  will  be  made  useful  as  well</span><span>  as  productive  ;  and  that  the  interests  of</span><span>  the  future  free  population  will  not  be  lost</span><span>  sight  of.</span></p> ",Article,1846-07-18,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

"<p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  JULY  11,  1846.</span></p> <p></p> <p><span>  WASTE  LAND  BILL.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Bill  to  amend  the  Act  for  regulating</span><span>  the  Sale  of  Waste  Land,  introduced  by</span><span>  Mr.  Hope  into  the  House  of  Commons  at</span><span>  the  close  of  the  last  session  of  Parliament,</span><span>  as  our  readers  are  probably  aware,  did  not</span><span>  proceed  beyond  a  first  reading.  A  copy</span><span>  has  since  been  forwarded  by  Lord  Stanley</span><span>  to  Sir  George  Gipps.  It  would  be  pre-</span><span>  mature  to  offer  any  decided  opinion  upon</span><span>  the  Bill  in  its  present  shape,  as  the  details</span><span>  are  very  vague  and  undefined.  The  views</span><span>  of  Government,  however,  have  been  made</span><span>  known  by  Lord  Stanley  in  his  despatches,</span><span>  which  are  explanatory  of  its  intended</span><span>  operation.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Bill  as  originally  introduced  was</span><span>  designed  to  effect  four  objects,  viz  :—To</span><span>  remove  any  doubts  which  might  be  enter-</span><span>  tained  of  the  power  of  the  Crown  to  grant</span><span>  leases  of  unsold  waste  land  ;  to  remove  a</span><span>  similar  doubt  as  regards  the  reservation  of</span><span>  minerals  ;  to  establish  a  fixed  annual  pay-</span><span>  ment  by  way  of  agistment  for  all  stock</span><span>  depastured  on  unsold  Crown  Lands,  in</span><span>  lieu  of  rent  or  fee  for  a  depasturing  li-</span><span>  cense  ;  and  to  appropriate  the  whole  pro-</span><span>  ceeds  to  be  raised  under  the  Bill  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  same  purposes  as  those  to  which  the  pro-</span><span>  ceeds  of  sales  are  devoted  by  the  original</span><span>  Act,  5  and  6  Vic.  c.  36.</span></p> <p><span>  The  first  clause  of  the  Bill  empowers</span><span>  the  Governor  to  grant  leases  for  seven</span><span>  years  at  an  annual  rent,  such  leases  to</span><span>  contain  clauses  of  forfeiture,  and  provisoes</span></p> <p><span>  for  re-entry  for  non-payment  of  such</span><span>  rent,  or  for  underletting  or  assignment  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  whole  without  leave  first  obtained</span><span>  from  the  Governor  ;  the  lease  thus  for-</span><span>  feited  to  be  offered  by  public  auction  to</span><span>  the  highest  bidder.  During  the  continu-</span></p> <p><span>  ance  of  such  lease,  however,  it  will  not</span><span>  be  lawful  for  the  Governor  to  sell  the  re-</span><span>  versionary  estate  expectant  upon  the  de-</span><span>  termination  of  such  lease  without  the</span><span>  consent  in  writing  of  the  lessee,  or  other</span><span>  party  to  whom  the  lease  may  then  belong.</span><span>  By  this  clause,  it  appears,  the  Governor</span><span>  may  or  may  not,  as  he  sees  fit,  put  up</span></p> <p><span>  leases  to  auction.</span></p> <p><span>  The  second  clause  provides  for  the  re-</span><span>  servation  of  minerals  for  the  use  of  the</span><span>  Crown.  Lord  Stanley,  however,  in  his  des-</span><span>  patches  intimates  that  provided  a  fair  royal-</span><span>  ty  be  preserved  to  the  Crown  for  the  benefit</span><span>  of  the  public,  Government  would  not  ob-</span><span>  ject  to  vest  in  the  grantees  and  purchasers</span><span>  from  the  Crown  the  right  to  the  minerals.</span></p> <p><span>  The  third  clause  proposes  to  repeal  sec.</span><span>  17  c.  36  of  5  and  6  Vic.  relating  to  the</span><span>  granting  of  licenses  for  the  occupation  of</span><span>  waste  lands  under  certain  conditions,  and</span><span>  for  felling  timber  on  such  lands.  This  will</span><span>  not  affect  any  license  that  may  have  been</span><span>  granted  previously  to  the  day  when  the</span><span>  Act  comes  into  operation.</span></p> <p><span>  By  the  fourth  clause  the  Governor  is</span><span>  empowered  to  grant  licenses  for  occupation</span><span>  of  waste  lands  for  twelve  months,  or  for</span><span>  felling,  removing,  and  selling  timber.</span><span>  The  reduction  of  the  former  upset  price</span><span>  of  occupation  licenses  is  left  to  the  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  cretion  of  the  Governor.</span></p> <p><span>  The  fifth  clause  specifies  the  penalties</span><span>  to  be  enforced  for  unauthorized  occupation</span></p> <p><span>  of  Crown  Lands.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  proposed  by  the  sixth  clause  to</span><span>  grant  licenses  to  occupiers  of  waste,  lands</span><span>  without  fee  or  payment  of  the  same,  and</span><span>  in  lieu  thereof  to  levy  a  capitation  tax  of</span><span>  one  penny  for  every  sheep,  and  three</span><span>  pence  for  every  horse  and  head  of  horned</span></p> <p><span>  cattle.</span></p> <p><span>  The  seventh  clause  enacts  that  when</span><span>  any  waste  land  beyond  the  Boundaries</span><span>  shall  have  been  occupied  by  any  person</span><span>  under  license  for  a  period  of  not  less  than</span><span>  five  successive  years,  then  next  preceding,</span><span>  the  Governor  may  lease  such  lands  to  such</span><span>  persons  for  seven  years,  at  such  an  annual</span><span>  rent  as  may  be  fixed  by  the  Governor  and</span><span>  the  Executive  Council,  without  offering</span><span>  such  lease  by  public  auction  to  the  high-</span></p> <p><span>  est  bidder.</span></p> <p><span>  The  remaining  clauses  relate,  to  the</span><span>  appropriation  of  proceeds  for  agistment,</span><span>  rent,  &c.,  and  other  matters  which  it  is</span><span>  not  necessary  we  should  particularize.</span></p> <p><span>  The  corollary  from  the  foregoing  is,</span><span>  that  the  present  annual  licenses  will  be</span><span>  continued  without  fee,  and  a  system  of</span><span>  agistment  will  be  adopted  with  a  capita-</span><span>  tion  tax  on  the  stock,  the  proceeds  of</span><span>  which  will  form  part  of  the  land  fund  of</span><span>  the  colony,  to  be  appropriated  to  the  pur-</span><span>  poses  of  emigration.</span></p> <p><span>  Secondly—That  persons  who  may  have</span><span>  been  in  possession  of  their  runs  five  years</span><span>  will  have  a  seven  years’  lease  granted,  at</span><span>  a  rental  to  be  fixed  by  the  Governor;</span><span>  such  lease  to  be  exempted  from  auction,</span><span>  and  their  stock  from  the  capitation  tax.</span></p> <p><span>  Thirdly—That  the  Governor  may  or</span><span>  not,  as  he  sees  fit,  authorize  the  occupation</span><span>  of  Crown  Lands  under  a  seven  years’  lease</span><span>  with  or  without  auction,  and  give  it  to</span><span>  the  highest  bidder.  This  may  affect  all</span><span>  persons  who  have  not  held  licenses  for</span><span>  their  runs  the  specified  term  of  five  years.</span></p> <p><span>  Such  then  is  the  analysis  of  the  Bill</span><span>  introduced  into  the  Imperial  Legislature.</span><span>  We  learn  from  Lord  Stanley  that  it  is</span></p> <p><span>  not  the  intention  of  the  Government  to</span><span>  supersede  any  system  already  in  operation,</span><span>  but  only  to  add  to  the  modes  in  which  the</span><span>  occupation  of  unsold  Crown  Lands  can</span><span>  be  permitted.  The  Bill  does  not  go  far</span><span>  enough  into  detail,  and  is  objectionable</span><span>  in  every  respect.  The  power  of  the  Go-</span><span>  vernor  is  not  to  be  controlled  by  the  Co-</span><span>  lonial  Legislature,  and  in  point  of  fact,  he</span><span>  may  do  just  what  he  pleases  with  the</span><span>  Crown  Lands.  No  clause  has  been  intro-</span><span>  duced  to  define  the  powers  of  the  Com-</span><span>  missioners,  the  reason  assigned  being  that</span><span>  by  the  adoption  of  the  system  of  agistment</span><span>  the  grounds  of  complaint  regarding  the</span><span>  extent  of  their  powers  would  be  removed,</span><span>  which  we  deny.  Let  not  the  stockholders</span><span>  be  misled  by  the  imaginary  liberality  of</span><span>  Government  in  granting  licenses  without</span><span>  fee  or  payment  under  the  proposed  system</span><span>  of  agistment.  So  long  as  the  Governor</span><span>  possesses  the  power  of  fixing  any  rental  he</span><span>  may  think  proper,  we  apprehend  they  will</span><span>  derive  but  little  advantage  from  the  new</span><span>  measure  :  Lord  Stanley,  indeed,  hints</span><span>  pretty  broadly  “that  the  rent  ought  to</span><span>  be  large  in  proportion  to  the  advantages</span><span>  conferred  by  the  granting  leases  without</span><span>  exposure  to  competition.”</span></p> <p><span>  We  are  not  prepared  at  present  to  enter</span><span>  more  at  large  into  this  subject,  nor  is  it</span><span>  necessary  that  we  should  do  so.  Sir</span></p> <p><span>  Charles  Fitzroy  is  daily  expected,  and  on</span><span>  his  arrival  we  shall  be  made  acquainted</span><span>  with  the  policy  of  Government  respecting</span><span>  this  vitally  important  question.  He  has</span><span>  been  invested  with  large  powers—let  us</span><span>  hope  that  they  will  be  exercised  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  good  of  those  over  whom  he  has  been</span><span>  placed  by  his  Sovereign  to  govern.</span></p> ",Article,1846-07-11,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

"<p><span>  CLASSIFICATION  OF  CONVICTS.</span></p> <p><span>  To  the  Editor  of  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  Sir.—As  your  have  entered  with  much  apparent</span><span>  interest  into  the  question  respecting  the  revival  of</span><span>  transportation  to  this  colony,  and  as  your  pages</span><span>  are  liberally  opened  to  the  public,  whilst  you</span><span>  wisely  abstain  from  giving  their  opinions  the</span><span>  weight  of  your  concurrence  ;  I  wish  to  draw  your</span><span>  attention,  and  that  of  your  readers,  to  the  neces-</span><span>  sity  of  some  more  strict  classification  of  the  con-</span><span>  victs  than  has  hitherto  obtained,  and  without  which</span><span>  the  punishment  of  transportation  must  continue  to</span><span>  be,  as  it  has  always  been,  a  mere  game  of  chance.</span><span>  I  hope  that  no  person  will  mistake  my  meaning,</span><span>  and  suppose  that  I  am  an  advocate  for  lenity  to</span><span>  educated  convicts,  merely  because  they  are  such  :</span><span>  on  the  contrary,  l  have  had  painful  opportunities</span><span>  of  knowing  that  an  overwhelming  majority  of  that</span><span>  description  of  persons  are  bad  and  dangerous  men,</span><span>  who  only  use  education  and  ability  as  aids  to  fraud</span><span>  and  chicanery,  and  who  therefore  need  a  strict  and</span></p> <p><span>  vigilant  control,  even  more  than  their  more  openly</span></p> <p><span>  criminal  fellows.  But  offenders  sometimes  appear</span><span>  at  the  bar  of  justice,  and  may  be  convicted  of</span><span>  crimes  punishable  by  the  present  laws  with  trans-</span><span>  portation,  yet  the  infliction  of  that  punishment  in</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  not  difficult  to  illustrate  my  meaning.  A</span></p> <p><span>  youth  of  sixteen—perhaps  in  a  merchant's  office—</span><span>  seduced  by  the  superior  display  of  the  gay  con-</span></p> <p><span>  nexions,  which  even  at  that  early  age  he  may</span><span>  form  in  a  large  city,  aud  tempted  (if  I  may  be</span><span>  pardoned  for  using  a  word  so  hacknied  in  the</span><span>  palliation  of  crime)  by  the  facilities  afforded  him</span><span>  of  dishonestly  increasing  his  means  of  expenditure,</span><span>  commits  a  breach  of  the  trust  reposed  in  him,  or</span><span>  in  some  other  way  offends  the  criminal  law.  God</span><span>  forbid  that  I  should  complain  if  that  law  punishes</span><span>  him,  or  if  those  whose  confidence  he  has  abused</span><span>  deem  it  their  duty  to  prosecute  him  as  an  example.</span><span>  It  may  be,  indeed,  that  in  some  instances  the  very</span><span>  sight  of  the  paraphernalia  of  a  Court,  the  cold  and</span><span>  impassable  Judge,  the  grim  officers  of  justice,  the</span><span>  prisoners'  dock,  and  the  myriads  of  eyes  around,</span><span>  all  fixed  upon  him,  would  be  sufficient  of  them-</span><span>  selves  to  reform  the  loose  principles  of  a  mind  not</span><span>  not  yet  systematically  vicious,  and  that  if  now</span><span>  pardoned  he  would  sin  no  more  ;  but  such  lenity</span><span>  would  be  in  every  way  objectionable  ;  it  is  just  and</span><span>  proper  for  the  well-being  of  society,  as  a  terror  to</span><span>  guilt,  and  as  an  encouragement  to  virtue,  that  he</span><span>  should  surfer  for  his  crime—but  the  punishment</span><span>  should  be  proportioned  to  fits  capacity  of  feel-</span><span>  ing  it.  His  offence  may  perhaps  subject  him  to</span><span>  the  severest  penalty,  save  death,  known  to  our</span><span>  laws,  and  he  is  accordingly  adjudged  to  transpor-</span><span>  tation  for  life—""  the  Court  awards  it,  and  the  law</span><span>  allows  it.""'  At  the  same  assize,  or  session,  fifty</span><span>  others  may  be  convicted,  and  the  whole  fifty  may</span><span>  have  been  known  from  their  childhood  to  every</span><span>  police  officer  in  the  kingdom  as  arrant  thieves</span><span>  ruffians,  whose  creed  is  robbery—whose  very  pre-</span><span>  sence  is  contamination,  and  amongst  whom;  even</span><span>  MURDER  is  spoken  of,  not  in  subdued  and  whisper-</span><span>  ing  tones,  but  with  all  the  confidence  of  free-</span><span>  masonry  :  yet  such  are  the  ""  fellow-convicts""  of</span><span>  the  wretched  criminal  I  have  supposed  !  Picture</span><span>  to  yourself,  if  you  can,  the  long  hours  of  heart</span><span>  bursting  agony  he  endures  in  gaol-the  fettered</span><span>  progress  to  the  hulk  :  chained  to  him  on  one  side</span><span>  is  a  veteran  receiver  of  stolen  good,  grown  grey</span><span>  in  his  trade  ;  and  on  the  other,  a  house-breaker</span><span>  and  would-be  murderer,  whose  prevailing  regret</span><span>  is,  that  he  did  not  ""  finish""  his  victim.  Perhaps</span><span>  the  unhappy  boy  may  think  it  strange  that  none</span><span>  of  these  wretches  should  be  so  severely  punished</span><span>  as  himself  !—but  he  soon  forgets  to  draw  com-</span><span>  parisons,  in  the  contemplation  of  his  own  misery.</span></p> <p><span>  Let  me  pass  over  the  hulk  and  the  transporta-</span><span>  tion  ship,—let  me  imagine  that  he  survives  the</span><span>  horrors  of  both.  He  has  at  length  learned  the</span><span>  folly  and  the  madness  of  shunning  intercourse</span><span>  with  those  around  him—he  finds  not  one  sym-</span><span>  pathetic  mind  in  all  that  crew  of  demi-fiends,  yet</span><span>  it  is  best  to  cultivate  their  acquaintance,  and  thus</span><span>  avoid  their  brutality.  Weary  of  the  bitter  scorn</span><span>  and  infernal  contempt  with  which  his  professions</span><span>  of  previous  honesty  are  received,  he  declares  that</span><span>  he  has  been,  like  them  all,  a  plunderer  from  his</span><span>  cradle  :  thus  only  can  he  hope  for  their  forbear-</span><span>  ance—at  best  they  look  upon  him  with  suspicion</span><span>  and  distrust—his  very  language  is  not  theirs,  and</span><span>  he  must  adapt  his  tongue  to  their  ferocious  blas-</span><span>  phemies,  and  his  mind  to  their  villainous  ideas  ;</span><span>  this  task  may  be  difficult,  but  the  voyage  is  a  long</span><span>  one,  and  his  teachers  are  many.  Arrived  in  New</span><span>  South  Wales,  he  is  most  probably  assigned  to  the</span><span>  service  of  some  person  possessing  already  scores</span><span>  of  convict  slaves  ;  he  has  now,  of  course,  ample</span><span>  opportunities  of  completing  the  education  he  has</span><span>  begun,  and  it  is  not  unreasonable  to  suppose  that</span><span>  a  new  set  of  ideas  soon  replace  those  which  be  im-</span><span>  bibed  in  his  childhood,  and  that  he  grows  sullen</span><span>  and  desperate,  It  could  scarcely  be  expected  that</span><span>  the  gaol  or  the  hulk  would  possess  the  virtue  of</span><span>  transforming  him  into  a  skilful  shepherd,  or  an</span><span>  athletic  labourer  ;  and  his  master,  in  true  colonial</span><span>  phrase,  will  soon  inform  him  that  ""  Jack  so-and-</span><span>  so  (who  has  broken  out  of  half  the  gaols  in  Eng-</span><span>  land)  is  worth  a  thousand  like  him.""  Here  then</span><span>  is  another  example  held  up  for  his  imitation,  and</span><span>  he  follows  it  :  the  consequences  are  obvious,  he</span><span>  adopts  the  crimes  of  his  associates,  but  lacks  the</span><span>  cunning  of  their  experience.  His  life  afterwards</span><span>  is  too  horrible  to  dwell  upon,—it  may  be  ended  by</span><span>  suicide,  the  lash,  or  the  gallows  :  either  result  is</span><span>  natural,  and  some  one  of  them  is  almost  inevitable.</span></p> <p><span>  Suppose,  however,  we  look  at  the  bright  side  of</span><span>  the  picture  ;  it  may  be  his  lot  (for  God  knows  it</span><span>  is  a  lottery)  to  meet  with  some  kind  and  noble</span><span>  minded  being  who  has  sufficient  discrimination  to</span><span>  pity  him,  and  sufficient  generosity  to  sacrifice  his</span><span>  interest  in  his  slave  to  that  feeling.  Many  such</span><span>  there  are,  and  honored  for  ever  be  their  names  :</span><span>  but  in  the  evolutions  of  fortune's  wheel  it  will</span><span>  rarely  occur  that  such  a  convict  obtains  such  a</span><span>  master.  Under  the  benign  control  of  this  good</span><span>  spirit  his  hopes  may  revive  ;  the  evil  influence  of</span><span>  his  late  companions  is  soon  lost  in  his  recollections</span><span>  of  happier  days.  Separated  by  the  kindness  of</span><span>  his  patron  from  the  contamination  of  such  society,</span><span>  he  becomes  a  sorrowful,  but  not  a  bad  man  ;  his</span><span>  bitter  tears  for  lost  happiness  are  mingled  with</span><span>  bright  hopes  and  high  resolutions  for  the  future  ;</span><span>  and  though  he  painfully  feels  his  present  degra-</span><span>  dation,  he  also  feels  its  justice,  and  consoles  him-</span><span>  self  with  the  anticipation  that  when  he  shall  have</span><span>  paid  the  penalty  of  his  offence,  he  may  again  hope</span><span>  for  the  sympathy  of  his  kind,  and  the  friendship</span><span>  of  his  equals.  Years  roll  by,  and  the  bonds  laid</span><span>  upon  him  in  the  days  of  his  youth  may  be  broken</span><span>  at  last  in  his  middle  age  ;  the  brightest  and  best</span><span>  years  of  his  life  have  been  passed  in  shame  and</span><span>  disgrace—even  now  his  sentence  of  perpetual</span><span>  banishment  remains,  and  he  knows  that  he  can</span><span>  never  see  again  the  green  fields  of  his  home.</span><span>  Yet  he  has  redeemed  himself  at  length  from  the</span><span>  hateful  name  of  ""  Convict,""  and  he  turns  to  his</span><span>  fellow-man  in  the  hope  of  the  same  mercy  which</span><span>  has  been  extended  to  him  by  his  sovereign.  Oh!</span><span>  vain  and  foolish  hope  !—every  eye  is  averted  from</span><span>  him-the  hand  of  friendship,  outstretched  towards</span><span>  him  in  acknowledgment  of  some  congenial  thought</span><span>  or  feeling,  is  convulsively  closed  and  snatched</span><span>  away  when  he  confesses  what  he  has  been  ;  those</span><span>  even  who  are  his  inferiors  in  every  respect  save</span><span>  this  one  alone,  affect  horror  at  the  bate  suspicion</span><span>  of  his  acquaintance  :  some  kindly  but  unreflective</span><span>  being  may  endeavour  to  cheer  him-by  pointing</span><span>  to  Mr.  A.  or  Mr.  B.,  persons  who  having  served</span><span>  sentences  of  transportation,  have  become  rich</span><span>  and  influential  :—he  cannot  answer,  for  his  heart</span></p> <p><span>  is  too  full  ;  if  he  could  speak  he  would  say  that</span><span>  those  men  were  of  a  different  stamp,  to  himself—</span><span>  that  they  have  no  one  feeling  in  common  with</span><span>  him—and  that  many  of  them  have  only  been</span><span>  weaned  from  dishonest  courses  by  becoming  con-</span><span>  vinced  of  their  impolicy.  His  great  hope  was  to</span><span>  redeem  himself  from  the  name  of  his  disgrace.</span><span>  but  he  now  finds  that  such  hopes  are  futile  ;  of</span><span>  what  avail  would  wealth  be  to  him  to  counter-</span></p> <p><span>  balance  the  frightful  isolation  of  his  position  ?</span></p> <p><span>  none  !  and  with  shuddering  horror,  he  at  length</span><span>  sees  that,  despite  his  long  years  of  suffering,  he</span><span>  is  a  convict  for  ever  !</span></p> <p><span>  It  may  be  urged  in  answer  to  this,  that  all</span><span>  society  should  draw  a  line  of  distinction  between</span><span>  the  innocent  and  the  guilty  ;  but  will  any  person</span><span>  assert:  that  such  exclusion  is  equally  felt  by  all</span><span>  classes  of  convicts  ?  The  desperate  thief  by  pro-</span><span>  fession,  even  although  reformed  in  this  colony,</span><span>  would  laugh  in  your  face  if  you  pitied  him  be-</span><span>  cause  he  was  excluded  from  the  society  of  good</span><span>  men  ;  he  is  accustomed  to  such  treatment,  and</span><span>  cares  for  no  better  company  than  persons  of  his</span><span>  own  tastes  and  habits  ;  but  the  trembling  penitent</span><span>  who  would  rather  die  than  herd  with  them,  and</span><span>  who  is  scornfully  repulsed  by  those  towards  whom,</span><span>  from  old  associations,  his  heart  warms,  must  be</span><span>  an  object  of  compassion  to  the  most  callous  :  who</span><span>  shall  guess  the  agony  of  thought  to  which  he  is</span><span>  doomed  night  and  day  throughout  the  dreary  blank</span><span>  which  remains  of  his  miserable  existence  ?—the</span><span>  utter  hopelessness  of  all  before  him  !—energies</span><span>  withered  by  inaction—and  talents,  perhaps,  with</span><span>  no  object  worthy  of  their  employment.  But  death</span><span>  is  his  best  friend,  and  comes  to  him  at  last.</span></p> <p><span>  This,  Sir,  is  no  overdrawn  picture,  such  things</span><span>  are—then  why  send  offenders  of  this  description</span><span>  to  a  penal  colony  ?  The  system  of  probation,</span><span>  adopted  with  so  much  success  in  England,  is  pe-</span><span>  culiarly  applicable  to  such  cases;  solitary  im-</span><span>  prisonment,  varying  in  duration  with  the  nature</span><span>  of  the  offence,  would  be  the  most  just  and  effective</span><span>  punishment:  and  if  banishment  must  follow,  let</span><span>  it  not  be  as  it  has  been.  For  the  sake  of  that</span></p> <p><span>  mercy  which  we  all  hope  for  hereafter,  let  the  un-</span><span>  happy  victim  of  his  first  crime  have  one  oppor-</span><span>  tunity  of  retrieving  his  fame,  and  do  not  send</span><span>  him  forth  with  the  foul  and  blighting  name  of</span><span>  ""  Convict""  clinging  to  him  like  a  leprosy  for</span><span>  ever.  Let  the  past  be  forgotten  !  the  ill  already</span><span>  done  no  mortal  legislature  can  repair  ;  but  they</span><span>  have  the  future  in  their  power,  and  as  I  fear  that</span><span>  such  cases  as  I  have  alluded  to  form  but  a  very</span><span>  small  proportion  in  the  bulk  of  convictions,  the</span><span>  adoption  of  a  more  merciful  course  to  such  of-</span><span>  fenders  cannot  materially  affect  the  general  system</span><span>  of  transportation,  which,  with  some  modifications,</span><span>  and  with  the  above  exceptions,  is  calculated  to</span><span>  reform  the  criminal  while  it  greatly  benefits  the</span><span>  country  of  his  banishment.  Without  reference</span><span>  to  the  education,  connexion,  or  plausible  manners</span><span>  of  the  offender,  the  most  strict  inquiry  should  be</span><span>  instituted  into  his  former  character  and  pursuits</span><span>  —so  that  the  erring  school-boy  may  never  during</span><span>  the  course  of  his  punishment  be  exposed  to  the</span><span>  contaminating  influence  of  the  practised  criminal,</span><span>  or  to  the  odium  of  having  been  his  fellow.</span></p> <p><span>  I  am  painfully  sensible  of  the  weakness  of  this</span><span>  voice  from  the  wilderness,  but  if,  it  could  reach</span><span>  those  to  whom  providence  has  committed  the</span><span>  charge  of  these  things,  it  should  not  now  be</span><span>  silent.  On  some  future  occasion  1  may  address</span><span>  you  upon  the  subject  of  classification  amongst</span><span>  those  who  should  be  sent  out  as  convicts-a</span></p> <p><span>  matter  also  of  deep  interest,  and  of  paramount</span><span>  necessity.—I  am,  Sir,</span></p> <p><span>  Your  most  obedient  servant,</span></p> ",Article,1846-11-07,CLASSIFICATION OF CONVICTS.

"<p><span>  THE</span></p> <p><span>  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  DECEMBER  12,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  WASTE  LANDS  ACT.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  House  of  Lords  on  the  6th  August,</span><span>  Earl  Grey,  the  new  Secretary  for  the</span><span>  Colonies,  stated  that  it  was  intended  to</span><span>  proceed  with  the  Crown  Lands  Bill,  ""  with</span></p> <p><span>  certain  anendments,  which  he  had  to  pro-</span></p> <p><span>  pose  in  Committee.""  This  Bill  was  in-</span></p> <p><span>  troduced  in  the  House  of  Lords  in  June</span><span>  last,  by  Lord  Lyttleton,  late  Under-</span><span>  secretary  for  the  Colonies,  and  it  now</span><span>  appears  that  the  new  Ministry  are  desirous</span><span>  of  having  it  passed  during  the  present</span><span>  session,  with  certain  amendments  ;  but</span><span>  what  they  may.  be  is  not  known.  As  the</span><span>  Bill  at  present  stands,  it  is  even  more  ob-</span><span>  jectionable  than  the  one  brought  into  the</span><span>  House  of  Commons  by  Mr.  Hope,  at  the</span><span>  close  of  the  last  session  of  Parliament,  an</span><span>  abstract  of  which  was  given  in  this  jour-</span><span>  nal  on  the  11th  July  last.  As  soon  as</span><span>  Mr.  Cunninghame,  the  Port  Phillip  dele-</span><span>  gate,  became  acquainted  with  its  provi-</span><span>  sions,  he  lost  no  time  in  communicating</span><span>  with  the  Home  Government,  and  as  the</span><span>  letter  which  he  then  addressed  to  Mr.</span><span>  Gladstone  forcibly  and  clearly  points  out</span></p> <p><span>  the  evils  that  will  result  from  this  mea-</span></p> <p><span>  sure,  should  it  be  passed  into  a  law,  we  re-</span><span>  print  it  for  the  information  of  our  readers</span><span>  in  the  bush,  reserving  our  own  remarks</span><span>  until  another  opportunity.  The  following</span></p> <p><span>  is  the  document  referred  to  :</span></p> <p><span>  82,  New  Bond-street,  London,</span></p> <p><span>  3rd  July,  1846.</span></p> <p><span>  Sir,-Having  accidentally  learnt  a  few  days  ago</span><span>  that  Lord  Lyttleton  had  laid  on  the  table  of  the</span><span>  House  of  Lords,  on  the  evening  of  the  25th  ult.,  a</span><span>  Bill,  relating  to  the  management  of  the  waste</span><span>  lands  in  the  Australian  colonies,  along  with  cer-</span><span>  tain  despatches  and  other  documents  relating  to</span><span>  that  subject,  and  having  since  had  an  opportunity</span><span>  of  perusing  these  documents,  I  now  do  myself</span><span>  the  honour  to  address  you  on  the  Bill  in  question.</span><span>  This  Bill  seems  to  be  nearly  similar  to  the  one</span><span>  introduced  into  the  House  of  Commons  on  the  8th</span></p> <p><span>  of  August,  1845,  and  it  appears  from  the  printed</span><span>  despatches  that  that  Bill  after  being  read  a  first</span><span>  time,  was  transmitted  to  Sir  George  Gipps  for  his</span><span>  remarks  and  corrections,  and  that  subject  to  the</span><span>  alteration  suggested  by  him,  that  Bill  met  his  ap-</span><span>  proval.  But  it  further  appears,  from  the  date  at</span><span>  which  the  Bill  was  received  in  New  South  Wales,</span><span>  being  the  4th  January,  1846,  (a  period  when  the</span><span>  Legislative  Council  was  not  sitting,  and  would</span><span>  not  re-assemble  for  two  months  afterwards),  that</span><span>  no  time  or  opportunity  has  yet  been  afforded  for</span><span>  receiving  the  opinion  of  the  Legislative  Council</span><span>  upon  it.  I  feel  deep  regret  that  a  measure  of  such</span><span>  vital  importance  to  New  South  Wales  should  have</span><span>  been  re-introduced  into  Parliament  on  the  strength</span><span>  of  Sir  George  Gipps's  approval,  without  pausing</span><span>  for  the  expression  of  the  opinion  of  the  colonists</span><span>  thereon,  through  their  legal  representatives,-a</span><span>  haste,  the  more  to  be  regretted,  since  the  almost</span><span>  unanimous  condemnation,  by  the  colony,  of  the</span><span>  previous  measures  and  propositions  of  his  Excel-</span><span>  lency  on  the  same  subject  would  have  led  us  to</span><span>  hope  for  such  delay  as  would  have  admitted  the</span><span>  opinion  of  the  colonists  to  be  heard  on  the  sub-</span><span>  ject,-this,  however,  has  not  been  granted.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  absence,  therefore,  of  any  such  formal  ex-</span><span>  pression  of  the  sentiments  of  the  colonists  of  New</span><span>  South  Wales,  I  venture,  both  as  a  colonist,  recently</span><span>  arrived  from  Australia,  and  in  fulfilment  of  the</span><span>  mission,  with  which  I  have  been  publicly  entrusted</span><span>  by  the  inhabitants  of  Port  Phillip,  to  offer  the  fol-</span><span>  lowing  remarks  on  this  Bill  :-</span></p> <p><span>  Passing  over  for  a  moment  the  two  first  clauses,</span><span>  I  find  that  the  3rd,  4th,  5th,  and  6th  clauses  re-</span><span>  enact  in  almost  similar  terms,  the  clauses  as  to</span><span>  license  and  assessment  which  are  contained  in  .the</span><span>  Colonial  Act,  2nd  Victoria  No.  27,  and  which</span><span>  form  the  present  squatting  system,  I  confess  my</span><span>  surprise  to  find  it  thus  proposed  to  re-enact,  with</span><span>  all  the  benefit  of  a  British  statute,  a  system  which,</span><span>  after  having  been  in  operation  for  ten  years,  under</span><span>  two  stringent  Colonial  Acts,  has  been  generally</span><span>  admitted  to  be  injurious  not  only  to  the  pecuniary</span><span>  interests  of  the  colony,  but  to  the  far  higher  in-</span><span>  terests  of  morality  and  religion.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Bishop  of  Australia,  in  a  document  dated</span><span>  30th  September,  1844,  and  read  in  the  Executive</span><span>  Council,  says,  in  reference  to  this  licensing  sys-</span><span>  tem,  ""  the  Government  was  therefore  accessary  to</span><span>  the  evils  which  were  springing  up,  in  consequence</span><span>  of  no  one  having  a  sufficient  interest  in  what  he</span><span>  held,  to  make  him  surround  himself  with  the  com-</span><span>  forts  of  religion  and  domestic  life,  or  to  introduce</span><span>  the  institutions  and  ordinances  on  which  the</span><span>  moral  and  religious  improvement  of  communities</span><span>  depend.""</span></p> <p><span>  It  was  with  the  avowed  object  of  remedying  the</span><span>  admitted  evils  of  this  system  that  Sir  G.  Gipps</span><span>  framed  his  ""  Recommendations""  of  3rd  April,</span><span>  1844.  As  the  latest  petition  from  the  colonists</span><span>  asks  for  a  better  system  of  tenure  of  the  Crown</span><span>  lands  than  is  given  by  this  system-as  the  Legis-</span><span>  lative  Council  has  clearly  pointed  out  the  great</span><span>  evils  of  the  present  tenure-as  the  Bishop  has  not,</span><span>  to  my  knowledge,  withdrawn  the  eloquently  ex-</span><span>  pressed  opinions  I  have  already  quoted,  as  the</span></p> <p><span>  moral  and  religious  ills  it  has  given  birth  to-and</span><span>  as  the  Governor  still  expresses  his  wish  for  a  better</span><span>  system  of  tenure  of  the  Crown  lands,  I  am  at  a</span><span>  loss  to  discover  any  sufficient  grounds  for  thus</span><span>  perpetuating,  under  the  solemn  sanction  of  the</span><span>  British  Parliament,  a  system,  the  evils  of  which</span><span>  are  thus  universally  admitted  and  condemned.</span><span>  In  one  important  particular;  I  find  that  the  New</span><span>  Squatting  Bill  diners  from  that  which  it  is  to  su-</span><span>  persede  ;,  in  this  way,  that  while  the  Colonial  Act</span><span>  provides  that  the  assessment  raised  should  be  ex-</span><span>  pended  on  the  payment  of  the  Crown  Land  Com-</span><span>  missioners,  and  the  support  of  a  rural  police  for</span><span>  the  protection  of  the  interior-an  expenditure  ne-</span><span>  cessarily  under  the  controul  of  the  local  legisla-</span></p> <p><span>  ture-the  new  Bill  adverts  the  assessment  to</span></p> <p><span>  other  purposes,  and  places  it  under  the  controul</span><span>  of  the  Lords  of  the  Treasury,  which  would  thus</span><span>  necessitate  the  levy  of  another  tax  upon  the</span><span>  squatters  for  the  payment  of  a  rural  police.</span></p> <p><span>  I  turn  now  to  the  first  clause,  which  permits,</span><span>  the  Government  to  grant  leases  for  seven  years  ;</span><span>  but  premises  that  all  such  leases  shall  be  offered</span><span>  by  auction  to  the  highest  bidder.</span></p> <p><span>  For  several  years  past  the  squatters  have  ear-</span><span>  nestly  petitioned  her  Majesty  and  the  British  Par-</span><span>  liament  to  grant  them  a  better  tenure  of  their</span><span>  runs  :  but  it  can  scarce  be  supposed  that  they  will</span><span>  accept,  as  any  compliance  with  their  petitions,  this</span><span>  proposal  to  sell  off  their  homes-rude  and  humble</span><span>  as  they  may  be-to  the  highest  bidder.  The  effect</span><span>  of  the  loss  of  his  run  on  the  prospects  of  the</span><span>  squatter,  I  cannot  better  describe  than  in  the</span><span>  words  of  the  Colonial  Secretary,  Mr.  Deas  Thom-</span><span>  son,  who  says,  in  his  evidence  before  the  Land</span><span>  Committee,  page  81,  ""To  deprive  a  man  of  his</span><span>  station  may  be  to  deprive  him  of  the  very  means</span></p> <p><span>  of  existence.""</span></p> <p><span>  But  I  beg,  Sir,  that  it  may  not  be  supposed  that</span><span>  the  only  argument  of  the  squatters  against  being</span><span>  sold  off  by  auction,  is  an  argument  of  ad</span><span>  misereccrdiam.  He  claims  relief  on  the  grounds</span></p> <p><span>  of  justice,  from  being  obliged  to  compete  at  auc-</span><span>  tion  for  the  right  of  occupation  of  a  run,  which</span><span>  he  has  discovered,  defended,  and  improved;  and</span><span>  which  he  has  so  discovered,  defended,  and  im-</span><span>  proved  on  the  faith  that  he  was  to  be  permitted,</span><span>  on  payment  of  the  license  fee  and  assessment,  to</span><span>  occupy  it  until  it  should  be  sold  in  tire  regular</span><span>  progress  of  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  He  has  invested  a  large  capital  in  sheep  and</span><span>  sheep-farming  necessaries,  on  the  faith  of  such  a</span><span>  tenure.  The  Local  Government  has  stood  by,</span><span>  and  has  seen  and  encouraged  such  investments,</span><span>  well  knowing  the  faith  and  belief  on  which  such</span><span>  investments  were  made.  And  I  confidently,  Sir,</span><span>  put  it  to  yourself,  whether,  with  justice,  Govern-</span><span>  ment  can  now-without  object  to  itself-without</span><span>  gain  to  the  colony-without  advantage  to  any</span><span>  class-turn  suddenly  round  on  the  squatter  and</span><span>  and  eject  him,  or  endanger  his  ejection,  from  a</span><span>  run,  the  loss  of  which  will  depreciate,  almost  to</span><span>  annihilation,  the  capital  and  personal  property</span><span>  thus  placed  upon  the  land,  under  the  auspices  of</span></p> <p><span>  Government  itself.</span></p> <p><span>  Passing  over  the  second  clause,  which  does  not</span></p> <p><span>  affect  the  squatting  question,  I  now  come  to  the</span><span>  seventh  clause,  which  gives  the  Governor  the</span><span>  power  ""  if  he  should  see  fit""  to  grant  seven  years'</span><span>  leases  of  improved  homesteads,  without  auction,</span><span>  at  such  rent  as  he  may  fix.  Permit  me,  Sir,  on</span><span>  this  clause  to  remark,  though  doubtless  intended</span><span>  as  a  boon  to  the  squatter:s,  it  confers  really  no</span><span>  boon  at  all.  First.  Because  no  case  of  a  home-</span><span>  stead,  however  long,  or  at  however  low  a  rent,</span><span>  can  be  of  any  value  unless  accompanied  by  a  cor-</span><span>  respondingly  long  lease  of  the  run  attached  to  it,</span><span>  and  without  which  the  homestead  would  be  rather</span><span>  a  burden  than  a  benefit.  Second.  Because  this</span></p> <p><span>  Bill  does  not  confer  any  right  on  the  squatter  to</span><span>  demand  a  lease,  but  only  a  power  in  the  Governor</span><span>  to  give  it  if  he  thinks  fit.

That  in  reply  to  the  peti-</span><span>  tions  of  the  colonists  for  a  better  tenure  of  the</span><span>  waste  lands  (which  means  a  tenure  more  inde-</span><span>  pendent  of  the  will  of  the  Governor  for  the  time</span><span>  being),  the  first  and  seventh  clauses  of  this  Bill</span><span>  have  been  framed,  which,  under  the  name  of  con-</span><span>  ceding  a.lease,  add  fourfold  to  the  powers  of  the</span><span>  local  executive,  enabling  it  now,  not  merely  as</span><span>  before,  to  raise  the  annual  payments  upon  the</span><span>  whole  body  of  the  squatters,  but  also  to  press</span><span>  every  individual  in  detail  ;  ejecting  one  from  his</span><span>  run  by  auction,  forcing  an  arbitrary  rent  from</span><span>  another,  under  the  dread  of  being  sold  off,  and</span><span>  thus  controlling,  under  its  absolute  will,  a  class</span><span>  of  capitalist  tenants  who,  for  birth,  education,</span><span>  and  enterprise,  are  unequalled  by  any  body  of</span><span>  tenants  in  the  British  Empire.</span></p> <p><span>  Under  such  a  system,  all  will  be  doubt,  uncer-</span><span>  tainty,  and  distrust,  capital  will  be  withdrawn,</span><span>  and  capitalists  will  retire  from  an  occupation  which</span><span>  they  can  no  longer  pursue  with  profit,  and  leave</span><span>  a  colony  which  they  can  no  longer  inhabit  with</span><span>  independence,</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  unnecessary  for  me  to  comment  on  the</span><span>  details  of  a  measure,  the  principles  of  which  seem</span><span>  to  me  so  entirely  objectionable  ;  but  I  beg  to  draw</span><span>  your  attention  to  the  fact,  that  besides  the  danger</span><span>  to  which  this  Bill  would  expose  the  squatters,  if  it</span><span>  were  passed  into  a  law,  it  would  appear  from  the</span><span>  last  sentence  of  a  private  despatch  of  Sir.

Friell,  Esq.,</span><span>  has  just  issued  from  the  Sydney  Press.</span><span>  Mr.  Friell,  it  appears,  has  been  induced</span><span>  at  the  request  of  his  friends  to  furnish</span><span>  proprietors  of  stock  with  an  account  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  practical  results  of  Indian  Immigra-</span><span>  tion,  as  exemplified  by  the  conduct  of  the</span><span>  Coolies  employed  by  him  on  his  station</span><span>  at  Tent  Hill,  in  this  district.  The  author</span><span>  premises  that  the  opinions  he  has  formed</span></p> <p><span>  are  based  upon  a  very  close  observation</span><span>  of  the  character  and  disposition  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  natives  of  India,  during  his  long  resi-</span><span>  dence  in  that  country  ;  and  also  upon  the</span><span>  peculiar  and  anomalous  position,  owing</span><span>  to  the  technicalities  of  English  law,  in</span><span>  which  the  employers  and  importers  of</span><span>  this  description  of  labour  are  at  once</span><span>  placed  on  the  arrival  of  the  Coolies  in</span><span>  this  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Friell  says,  that  the  native  Indian</span><span>  is  alvays  suspicious  of  kindness,  and  that</span><span>  centuries  of  oppression  have  effaced  even</span><span>  from  their  language  any  term  by  which</span><span>  they  can  express  a  sense  of  gratitude  to</span></p> <p><span>  their  benefactors.  The  lower  castes  are</span><span>  not  guided  by  a  sense  of  common  honesty,</span><span>  even  in  their  dealings  inter  se,  and  yet</span><span>  such  is  their  appreciation  of  British  cha-</span><span>  racter  and  British  rule,  that  they  will</span><span>  confide  to  an  European  what  they  will</span><span>  not  entrust  to  any  of  their  own  blood  ;</span><span>  this  naturally  leads  them  to  look  up  to</span><span>  him  whenever  they  find  themselves  in</span><span>  difficulties,  which""""  they  are  unable,</span></p> <p><span>  from  their  innate  weakness  of  charac-</span><span>  ter,  to  surmount.  As  individuals,  how-</span><span>  ever,  they  are  becoming  daily  aware</span><span>  of  the  glorious  uncertainty  of  the  law,</span><span>  and  weigh,  with  instinctive  acumen,  the</span></p> <p><span>  chances  in  their  own  favour,  whenever</span><span>  they  may  have  made  themselves  obnoxious</span><span>  to  its  penalties.  In  fact,  it  is  this  very</span><span>  uncertainty,  which  induces  them  to  urge</span><span>  complaints  against  their  employers  in  this</span><span>  country,  in  order  that  their  agreements</span><span>  may  be  cancelled,  and  themselves  set  at</span><span>  liberty,  to  seek  employment  at  higher</span></p> <p><span>  wages.</span></p> <p><span>  With  regard  to  entering  into  agree-</span><span>  ments  with  Coolies,  Mr.  Friell  says</span></p> <p><span>  That  every  native  of  India  leaves  his  country</span><span>  predetermined  that  no  contract  shall  be  binding</span><span>  on  him  on  his  arrival  at  his  destination,  unless  it</span><span>  suits  his  convenience.  Hence  the  endeavours  to</span><span>  obtain  something  more  favourable  than  the  stipu-</span><span>  lated  terms,  and  as  he  does  not  understand</span><span>  English,  or  will  at  all  events  deny  all  knowledge</span><span>  of  the  language  in  which  this  agreement  in  all</span><span>  probability  is  written,  he  at  once  falls  back  upon</span><span>  the  oft  repeated,  and  as  he  thinks  the  unanswer-</span><span>  able  plea,  that  the  agreement  was  never  explained</span></p> <p><span>  lo  him,  that  he  knows  nothing  of  its  contents,  that</span><span>  a  verbal  promise  was  made  previous  to  his  quitting</span><span>  his  country  to  the  effect,  &c.  Then  follows  the</span><span>  real  demand  he  had  predetermined  to  make,  on</span><span>  arriving  at  his  destination,  should  circumstances</span></p> <p><span>  render  it  desirable  to  do  so,  and  that  without  re-</span><span>  ference  to,  or  in  total  disregard  of,  any  previous</span><span>  agreement.  The  usual  argument  of  a  native  of</span><span>  India,  when  unable  to  obtain  the  exact  terms  he</span><span>  may  wish  or  demand,  is-""  Never  mind,  brother,</span><span>  let  us  go,  and  if  we  cannot  mend  the  matter  in  the</span><span>  Police  Court,  on  our  arrival,  we  shall  at  all  events</span><span>  have  our  bellies  filled  at  another's  expense,  while</span><span>  here  we  are  starving.""</span></p> <p><span>  We  fear  that  all  this  is  too  true  It  was</span></p> <p><span>  only  the  other  day  we  witnessed  the  in-</span></p> <p><span>  difference  two  of  the  Coolies  exhibited  when</span></p> <p><span>  sentenced  to  be  imprisoned  by  the  Brisbane</span><span>  Bench.  It  was  quite  evident  that  it  would</span><span>  have  been  useless  to  reason  with  them</span></p> <p><span>  respecting  the  impropriety  of  their  con-</span><span>  duct,  Headstrong  and  self-willed,  they</span><span>  .appeared  determined  to  follow  their  own</span></p> <p><span>  course  regardless  of  such  punishment  as</span><span>  the  Magistrates  had  power  to  inflict.  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Friell  continues--</span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  This  plea  of  Ignorance,  so  generally  urged,  as</span><span>  regards  the  terms  of  agreement,  I  do  not  hesitate</span><span>  to  state  is  totally  unfounded.  In  a  word,  I  would</span><span>  venture  to  ask  those  who  oppose  the  immigration</span><span>  of  Indian  labourers,  if  they  really  believe  that  any</span><span>  number  of  men  can  be  put  on  board  a.  vessel  from</span><span>  India  for  a  distant  voyage,  without  their  being</span><span>  informed  of  every  item  of  their  agreement?""  I  am</span><span>  certain,  if  they  will  take  the  trouble  to  make  them-</span></p> <p><span>  selves  acquainted  with  the  native  character,  they</span><span>  will  at  once  pronounce  the  thing  impossible  in  the</span><span>  present  state  of  India.  When  selecting,  to  bring</span><span>  here  with  me  my  Indian  servants,  about  twenty</span><span>  five  in  number,  out  of  several  hundred  starving  in</span><span>  Calcutta,  the  first  question  I  was  asked  was,</span><span>  ""  What  will  you  give  me  ?""  and  when  at  length</span><span>  matters  had  been  adjusted,  and  the  agreement</span><span>  presented  to  them  for  signature  or  mark,  1  never</span><span>  found  one  of  them  willing  to  touch  the  pen  until</span><span>  the  contents  had  been  explained  to  his  satisfac-</span><span>  tion.  They  will  submit  the  corresponding  copy</span><span>  of  the  agreement  to  other  interpreters  than  the</span><span>  person  engaging  them,  before  putting  their  mark;</span><span>  but,  unfortunately  our  own  laws,  and  the  peculiar</span><span>  idiosyncrasy  of  our  officers,  are  the  sources  from</span><span>  whence  flow  the  most,  if  not  all,  the  inconvenience</span><span>  that  has  been,  and  is  likely  to  be  experienced  in</span><span>  the  importation  of  Indian  labour.  Our  public</span><span>  officers  appear  predisposed  to  believe  that  in  every</span><span>  case  where  an  European  and  native  of  India  are</span><span>  concerned,  ""  the  man  of  colour,""  ""  the  poor  in-</span><span>  nocent  Hindoo,""  must  be  an  oppressed  party.  The</span><span>  European  mind  is  not  prepared  to  find  (until  after</span><span>  repeated  lessons  of  experience)  that  the  Indian  can</span><span>  be  capable  of  the  nicest  subtlety,  and  thus  comes</span><span>  to  the  question  biased.  The  result  need  not  be</span><span>  told  :  the  line  of  argument  I  have  heard  from</span><span>  Benches  in  this  country  would  produce  rebellion</span><span>  in  the  best  disposed  Indian  servants  in  the  world  ;</span><span>  nor  can  I  look  upon  it  in  any  other  light  than  a</span><span>  premium  (no  doubt  unintentional)  for  Indian  dis-</span><span>  honesty.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Friell  then  instances  several  striking</span><span>  cases,  which  occurred  at  the  Supreme</span><span>  Court  in  Calcutta,  in  illustration  of  the</span><span>  evils  that  arise  from  these  ""  delicate  hair-</span></p> <p><span>  splitting  distinctions""  in  the  administra-</span><span>  tion  of  law,  which  pervert  and  hinder  the</span><span>  due  course  of  justice  between  the  two</span><span>  races--the  European  and  the  Indian.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Friell  is  of  opinion  that  it  will  be</span><span>  hazardous  to  introduce  Indian  labour  on</span></p> <p><span>  a  large  scale  unless  the  Legislative  Coun-</span><span>  cil  frame  laws  that  will  make  it  compul-</span><span>  sory  on  the  Coolie  to  fulfil  the  engage-</span><span>  ments  entered  into  in  his  own  country</span><span>  laws  in  the  making  of  which  due  allow-</span></p> <p><span>  ance  is  made  for  the  difference  between</span><span>  the  two  characters.  If  this  could  be  ac-</span></p> <p><span>  complished,  he  is  confident  that  no  labour</span><span>  in  the  world  will  give  greater  satisfaction</span><span>  than  that  of  the  Central  and  Upper  Pro-</span><span>  vinces  of  India,  provided  it  be  for  pastoral</span><span>  purposes,  and  under  European  supervision.</span></p> <p><span>  He  recommends  --</span></p> <p><span>  That  an  officer  of  Government  should  be  ap-</span><span>  pointed,  competent  in  every  way  to  adjudicate  in</span><span>  all  Indian  cases  on  the  arrival  of  these  people  in</span><span>  the  colony.  It  would  afford  protection  to  masters</span><span>  as  well  as  to  servants,  and  disabuse  the  Indian</span><span>  native  of  the  idea  that  he  can  tamper  with  agree-</span><span>  ments,  and  be  a  gainer  by  so  doing,  under  the</span><span>  high  rate  of  wages  common  here.  Amongst  us</span><span>  there  are  some  who  are  deeply  interested  in  a  dis-</span><span>  ruption  between  the  Indian  and  his  employer,</span><span>  whose  livelihood  is  made  to  depend  upon  litigation</span><span>  in  the  absence  of  a  language  common  to  the  par-</span><span>  ties  and  the  Bench-hence  it  may  be  justly  feared</span><span>  that  the  obligations  of  moral  principle  are  lost</span><span>  sight  of  when  advice  conies  to  be  administered</span><span>  from  such  quarters.</span></p> <p><span>  With  regard  to  the  management  of</span><span>  Coolies,  Air.  Friell  advises  that  they</span><span>  should  be  ,  employed  as  shepherds  and</span><span>  watchmen,  but  not  as  agricultural  ser-</span><span>  vants  ;  they  are  unfit  for  such  employ-</span><span>  ment,  and  do  not  like  it.  As  shepherds</span><span>  they  answer  better  than  Europeans,  pro</span><span>  vided  they  are  placed  under  the  super-</span><span>  intendence  of  one  who  thoroughly  un-</span><span>  derstands  their  character,  habits,  and</span><span>  disposition.  One  thing,  says  Mr  Friell,</span><span>  should  be  strictly  enjoined,  the  non-ob-</span><span>  servance  of  which  may  produce  a  general</span><span>  revolt  at  the  station,  and  that  is-  the</span><span>  overseer  should  not  expect  a  high  degree</span><span>  of  moral  conduct  and  patient  endurance</span><span>  of  hard  work,  which  he  would  expect</span></p> <p><span>  from  others  more  alive  to  their  moral</span></p> <p><span>  responsibilities.  The  incessant  finding</span><span>  fault  will  soon  wear  out  Indian  patience,</span><span>  and  the  moment  he  finds  that  he  cannot</span></p> <p><span>  give  satisfaction  he  loses  his  energy,  and</span><span>  his  self-respect.</span></p> <p><span>  The  wages  given  to  the  Coolies  at  the</span><span>  Tent  Hill  station  are  at  the  rate  of  4</span><span>  rupees,  or  8s.  per  month  ;  to  boys,  2  ru-</span><span>  pees,  or  4s.  ;  and  payment  is  made  in</span><span>  silver  at  the  expiration  of  each  month  ;</span><span>  which  practice,  however,  has  been  found</span><span>  inconvenient,  and  quarterly  or  half-yearly</span><span>  payments  are  recommended-but  whatever</span><span>  period  may  be  agreed  upon,  ""punctuality</span><span>  is  expected,  to  prevent  discontent,  and,  to</span><span>  an  Indian  mind,  suspicion.""  The  Coolies</span><span>  save  four-fifths  of  their  wages,  the  re-</span><span>  maining  fifth  being  expended  at  the  store</span><span>  on  the  station.  They  are  engaged  for</span><span>  five  years,  and  at  the  terminations  that</span><span>  period  Mr.  Friell  is  bound  to  send  them</span><span>  back  to  their  own  country,  unless  their</span><span>  agreements  have  been  cancelled,  on  ac-</span><span>  count  of  misconduct,  by  the  Magistrates.</span><span>  The  expense  would  probably  be  about  £5</span><span>  to  £7,  varying  according  to  number.</span></p> <p><span>  The  ration  demanded  by  the  Coolies  on</span><span>  leaving  their  own  country  is  as  follow  :</span></p> <p><span>  1  'Rice  or  flour..,...._  7  lbs.  weekly</span></p> <p><span>  Dholl  ......  1  3/4  ""</span></p> <p><span>  Onions  ....

That  the  trade  and  industry  of</span><span>  Scotland,  however,  have  increased  very</span></p> <p><span>  considerably  during  that  period,  and  that  the</span><span>  Banks  have  contributed  a  good  deal  to  this</span><span>  increase,  cannot  be  denied.""—Smith’s  Wealth</span></p> <p><span>  of  Nations.</span></p> <p><span>  BRISBANE  numbers  amongst  its  residents</span><span>  a  class  of  persons,  who  flourish  in  young,</span></p> <p><span>  as  well  as  in  old  communities—a  class</span></p> <p><span>  who  wait  upon  enterprise,  or  accelerate</span><span>  disaster—a  class  only  prominent  in  a</span><span>  youthful  and  imperfectly  organised</span><span>  society,  whose  members  are  gifted  with</span><span>  energy,  fortitude,  and  enterprise,  or  in</span><span>  that  in  whose  bosom  are  to  be  found  the</span></p> <p><span>  symptoms  of  decay.

(New  reading).</span><span>  Amongst  us,  these  persons  are  a  recog-</span><span>  nised,  and,  for  the  present,  an  indispensa-</span><span>  ble  element  of  our  society  ;  their  services</span><span>  are  often  needed  and  obtained,  although,</span><span>  it  must  be  owned,  their  reward  is  some-</span><span>  what  large.  Twenty  per  cent.  is,  we  are</span><span>  told,  the  rate  of  discount  charged  on  a</span><span>  good  order  drawn  upon  a  mercantile  house</span><span>  in  Sydney,  which,  on  an  average  through-</span><span>  out  the  year,  is  cashed,  and  the  proceeds</span></p> <p><span>  returned  to  the  discounter  within  fifteen</span></p> <p><span>  days  after  falling  into  his  hands.  This,</span><span>  on  a  rough  calculation,  we  find  to  be  at</span><span>  the  rate—hear  it,  ye  who  know  not  Jeremy</span><span>  Bentham,  and  who  look  upon  usury  and</span><span>  usurers  with  all  the  horror  of  your  grand-</span></p> <p><span>  sires—of  FOUR  HUNDRED  AND  EIGHTY  PER</span><span>  CENT.  PER  ANNUM  !</span></p> <p><span>  Let  it  not  be  understood  that  we  wish</span><span>  to  censure  either  usurers  or  the  practice  of</span><span>  usury.  We  hold  that  every  man  is  en-</span><span>  titled  to  employ  his  capital  or  his  industry</span><span>  as  he  pleases,  provided  that  he  does  so</span><span>  without  breaking  the  laws,  and  without</span><span>  injury  to  the  peace  and  good  order  of</span><span>  society.

Half  of  this  sum,</span><span>  at  the  least,  will  fall  to  the  share  of  the</span><span>  labouring  population,  and  will  be  invari-</span><span>  ably  received  in  orders,  drawn  by  their</span><span>  employers  on  their  men  of  business  in</span><span>  Sydney.  These  orders,  as  invariably,  will</span><span>  fall  into  the  hands  of  our  merchants,  trades-</span><span>  men  and  discounters,  and  be  transmitted</span></p> <p><span>  by  them  to  their  agents  in  the  metropolis,</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  who  usually  collect  and  remit  the  proceeds</span><span>  at  a  charge  of  two-and-a-half  per  cent.</span><span>  The  rate  of  discount  upon  orders  at</span><span>  Brisbane,  varies  from  a  moderate  charge</span><span>  for  risk,  delay,  and  expense  of  collection,</span><span>  to  20  per  cent.  :  the  first  entering  into  the</span><span>  prices  of  goods  taken  in  exchange,  the</span><span>  latter  being  demanded  by  our  recognised</span><span>  usurers.  Taking  ten  per  cent.  as  an</span><span>  average,  the  sum  of  £6,000  will  thus,</span><span>  during  the  coming  season,  be  lost  either</span><span>  by  the  labouring  classes,  or  their  em-</span></p> <p><span>  ployers.</span></p> <p><span>  By  lowering  the  prices  of  provisions,</span><span>  and  all  other  merchandise,  by  lessening</span><span>  the  cost  of  subsistence,  by  reducing  the</span><span>  amount  of  wages  paid  by  masters,  and  at  the</span><span>  same  time  increasing  the  actual  remunera-</span><span>  tion  of  labour,  a  sufficient  and  steady</span><span>  medium  of  circulation,  secured  by  the</span></p> <p><span>  operations  of  a  bank,  would  be  productive</span></p> <p><span>  of  benefits  too  apparent  to  need  remark.</span><span>  If  the  advantage  that  would  thus  result</span></p> <p><span>  is  great,  those  that  would  accompany  its</span><span>  extension  of  the  commerce—of  the  field</span><span>  for  the  employment  of  our  capital  and</span><span>  industry,  are  yet  greater.  The  transac-</span><span>  tions  of  a  merchant  or  storekeeper  in</span><span>  Brisbane,  for  instance,  are  limited  by  the</span><span>  amount  of  his  quarterly  returns,  and  that</span><span>  portion  of  his  capital  which  he  is  at  pre-</span><span>  sent  compelled  to  keep  as  cash  in  hand,</span><span>  and  which  is,  in  fact,  so  much  dead  stock,</span><span>  being  altogether  unproductive.  But  were</span><span>  a  Bank  introduced,  not  only  would  that</span><span>  cash  in  hand,  or  dead  stock,  be  added  to</span><span>  his  circulating  capital,  but  he  might  safely</span><span>  and  prudently  obtain  advances  from  the</span><span>  Bank,  in  the  shape  of  bills  discounted  and</span><span>  a  cash  credit,  equal  to,  and  secured  by,  his</span><span>  whole  bona  fide  property.  His  trade,  there-</span><span>  fore,  according  to  sound  business  prin-</span><span>  ciples,  and  the  dictates  of  common  sense,</span><span>  might  be  legitimately  doubled,  without</span><span>  his  overstepping  the  bounds  of  judicious  and</span><span>  commendable  speculation.  And  the  re-</span><span>  mark  thus  applied  to  an  individual,  might</span></p> <p><span>  be  extended  to  the  whole  mercantile  com-</span></p> <p><span>  munity.</span></p> <p><span>  The  amount  of  capital  withdrawn  by</span><span>  the  Anglo-Australian  Banks  from  circu-</span><span>  lation  in  these  colonies,  ""  during  the</span><span>  panic,""  is  very  large—that,  by  the  Union</span><span>  Bank  alone,  being  £606,673  ;  and  this</span></p> <p><span>  sum  the  Home  Directors  have  declared</span></p> <p><span>  their  willingness  to  re-apply  to  colonial</span><span>  purposes,  whenever  eligible  opportunities</span><span>  may  offer  for  its  investment.*  We  feel</span><span>  convinced,  therefore,  that  the  advantages  of</span><span>  Brisbane  only  require  to  be  known  to  secure</span><span>  its  participation  in  the  benefits  of  banking</span><span>  institutions.  The  proofs  of  its  commer-</span><span>  cial  progress,  which  it  will  be  our  duty  to</span><span>  record,  will,  we  doubt  not,  excite  general</span><span>  attention.  In  the  colonies,  its  importance</span><span>  begins  to  be  recognised.  Every  vessel</span><span>  arriving,  brings  an  accession  to  its  popu-</span><span>  lation.  At  present,  indeed,  Brisbane</span><span>  scarcely  gives  promise  of  its  future  great-</span><span>  ness.  Surrounded  by  soils  which  now  lie</span><span>  waste,  but  which  only  require  the  hand  of</span><span>  industry  to  yield  returns  highly  re-</span><span>  munerative,  it  commands  a  noble  river,</span><span>  navigable  a  distance  of  seventy  miles  ;  the</span><span>  banks  of  which,  clothed  with  the  pine,  the</span><span>  cedar,  the  caoutchouc,  and  a  great  variety  of</span><span>  valuable  trees,  also  abound  with  coal,  and</span><span>  much  other  mineral  wealth.  Already  a</span><span>  town  of  considerable  note,  Brisbane  must</span><span>  eventually  become  the  outlet  to  an  im-</span><span>  mense  tract  of  land,  yet  unoccupied,  well</span><span>  fitted  for  pastoral  and  agricultural  pur-</span><span>  poses  ;  and  its  position  must  render  it,</span><span>  when  declared  FREE,  a  port  of  refit  for  all</span><span>  foreign  whalers  frequenting  our  northern</span><span>  whaling  grounds.  In  short,  look  where</span><span>  we  may,  we  behold  capabilities  requiring</span><span>  but  industry  and  capital  for  their  develop-</span><span>  ment  ;  on  all  sides,  are  signs  of  encour-</span><span>  agement,  and  the  hand-writing  on  the</span><span>  wall  is  plainly  to  be  seen,—it  is,</span></p> <p><span>  PROGRESS.</span></p> <p><span>  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  Com-</span></p> <p><span>  pany  which  is  first  to  step  forward,</span><span>  and  relieve  us  from  our  present  confused</span><span>  and  imperfect  operations  of  trade,  by  the</span><span>  institution  of  a  Bank,  will  in  all  future</span><span>  time,  under  judicious  management,  in</span><span>  spite  of  competitions,  deserve  and  possess</span><span>  in  a  superior  degree  the  confidence  of  the</span><span>  community.</span><span>  EXPLORATION.</span><span>  A  LETTER  has  been  recently  received  by  a</span><span>  gentleman  in  Brisbane,  from  Dr.  Leich-</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><span>  *  ""  The  very  large  proportion  of  the  bank's</span><span>  capital  which  is  now  in  this  country,  will  be  in</span><span>  readiness  to  meet  the  legitimate  wants  of  banking</span><span>  facilities,  which  an  improved  state  of  trade  will</span><span>  necessarily  produce,  and  from  the  high  standing</span><span>  which  the  bank  has  attained,  the  directors  enter-</span><span>  tain  no  doubt  that,  possessing  as  it  does  the  con-</span><span>  fidence  of  the  colonial  community,  it  will  derive  in</span><span>  a  proportionate  degree  the  advantages  of  return-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  prosperity.""—Extract  from  the  last  Report</span><span>  of  the  Home  Directors  of  the  Union  Bank.</span></p> <p><span>  (  January,  1846.  )</span></p> <p></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  hardt,  in  which  he  briefly  sketches  his</span><span>  contemplated  route.

In  our</span><span>  opinion,  this  part  ought  to  have  been</span><span>  reserved  when  the  township  was  laid  out  ;</span><span>  and  it  is  a  matter  of  surprise  that  Sir</span><span>  George  Gipps,  when  he  gave  directions  to</span><span>  Mr.  Wade  for  its  survey,  did  not  do  so.</span><span>  It  is  not,  however,  too  late  to  remedy  the</span><span>  blunder,  and  our  fellow-townsmen  should</span></p> <p><span>  at  once  bestir  themselves  in  the  matter.</span></p> <p><span>  No  measures  for  the  improvement  of  the</span><span>  salubrity  of  the  town  can  be  complete</span><span>  without  an  ample  and  cheap  supply  of</span><span>  water,  not  only  for  street  cleansing,  but  in</span><span>  the  dwellings  of  the  poor,  being  first</span><span>  secured;  and  every  year's  postponement</span><span>  by  the  inhabitants,  of  this  urgent  public</span><span>  duty,  will  only  render  the  object  more</span></p> <p><span>  difficult  to  be  achieved.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  no  doubt  but  that  the  new</span><span>  Governor  will  accede  to  the  wishes  of  the</span><span>  inhabitants,  when  a  representation  is  made</span><span>  to  him  on  the  subject.  But  as  this  is</span><span>  essentially  a  local  matter,  the  cost  of  put-</span><span>  ting  the  Reservoir  in  repair,  cutting  con-</span><span>  duits  for  the  conveyance  of  water,  and</span><span>  fencing  it  in,  will  have  to  be  defrayed  by</span><span>  the  inhabitants  ;  and  on  this  account,  we</span><span>  should  deeply  deplore  any  apparent  indif-</span><span>  ference,  or  want  of  unanimity  amongst</span><span>  them.  We  know  how  difficult  it  is  to</span><span>  rouse  people  to  work  out  a  plan  of  this</span><span>  kind,  but  the  advantages  to  be  derived  from</span><span>  it  are  so  obvious,  that  we  are  sure  no  impe-</span><span>  diment  will  be  thrown  in  the  way  by  the</span><span>  authorities  in  bringing  about  an  arrange-</span><span>  ment  satisfactory  to  all  parties.

"<p><span>  THE  BENEVOLENT  SOCIETY.</span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  THE  Annual  General  Meeting  of  the  members  of</span><span>  this  Society  was  held  at  the  Court  House,  North</span><span>  Brisbane,  on  Tuesday  last,  for  the  purpose  of</span><span>  electing  the  annual  committee,  and  auditing  the</span><span>  accounts.  The  members  present  were:-  Captain</span></p> <p><span>  Wickham,  R.N.  Dr.  Ballow,  Dr.  Cannan,  T.</span><span>  Adams,  Esq.,  Captain  Coley,  Mr.  John  Richard-</span><span>  son,  Mr.  W.  Kent,  Mr.  R.  F.  G.  Phelan,  and</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Gill.</span></p> <p><span>  Captain  WICKHAM,  President,  said,  the  Society</span><span>  had  been  of  much  benefit  to  the  district.  Their</span><span>  object  was  to  relieve  the  poor,  the  distressed,  and,</span><span>  the  aged  ;  and  although  the  income  of  the  Society</span><span>  at  present,  was  small,  eighteen  individuals  had,</span><span>  been  relieved,  which  was  quite  sufficient  to  prove,</span><span>  its  utility.  It  was  true,  and  he  very  much  re-</span><span>  gretted  the  fact,  that  the  contributions  from  the</span><span>  various  stations  in  the  two  districts  had  been  con-</span><span>  fined  to  three  or  four  charitable  individuals,  and</span><span>  he  would  mention  the  names  of  Bracker,  Leslie,</span><span>  and  Hodgson,  who  had  taken  great  interest  in  the</span><span>  welfare  of  the  Institution.  It  was  but  fair  that</span><span>  the  settlers  generally  should  come  forward  and</span><span>  subscribe,  as  the  greater  number  of  persons  who</span><span>  had  received  relief  were  their  servants.  These</span><span>  men  in  coming  down  from  the  bush,  indulged  in</span><span>  vicious  habits  on  the  road,  and  when  sickness</span><span>  overtook  them  came  to  Brisbane  for  relief.  It</span><span>  was  highly  desirable  that  some  arrangement  should</span><span>  be  made  with  the  settlers,  to  induce  them  to  raise</span><span>  contributions  from  the  men  at  their  stations,  and</span><span>  remit  the  amount  to  the  society,  which  could  easily</span><span>  be  done  with  the  consent  of  the  servants.

The  an-</span><span>  nual  subscription  is  one  pound,  and  any  subscriber</span><span>  contributing  thirty  pounds  in  one  year  becomes  a  life</span><span>  member.  It  originated  from  motives  of  pure  bene-</span><span>  volence  on  the  part  of  several  influential  inhabitants</span><span>  of  Brisbane,  and  now  it  must  be  classed  amongst  the</span><span>  truly  valuable  charities  of  the  town.  During  the</span><span>  two  years  it  has  been  in  existence,  much  practical</span><span>  good  has  been  done  to  suffering  humanity.  It  is</span><span>  the  most  deplorable  feature  in  the  condition  of  the</span><span>  working  classes  of  this  colony  that  they  make  no</span><span>  provision,  either  for  themselves  or  their  families,</span><span>  against  failure  of  employment,  sickness,  or  death.</span><span>  The  result  of  such  a  state  of  things  is,  that  they</span><span>  have  never  more  than  a  thin  partition  between  the</span><span>  state  of  poverty  and  plenty.  When  afflicted  with</span><span>  disease,  many  amongst  them  are  quite  helpless,  and</span><span>  they  then  are  compelled  to  seek  gratuitous  medicine</span><span>  as  well  as  medical  attendance.  The  habitual  drun-</span><span>  kard  deserves  no  commiseration  at  our  hands  ;</span><span>  but  the  old,  the  infirm,  and  the  sufferers  from</span><span>  casualties,  can  receive  charitable  assistance  without</span><span>  sacrifice  of  true  manly  dignity  ;  and  it  is  for  the</span><span>  benefit  of  such  persons  that  the  Institution  has</span><span>  been  established  ;  to  such  persons  it  has  already</span><span>  afforded  relief  commensurate  to  its  income.  Nu-</span></p> <p><span>  merically  considered,  the  Society  has  not  that</span><span>  wide  and  extensive  influence  which  it  ought  to</span><span>  have  upon  the  public,  and  which  can  only  be  ob-</span><span>  tained  by  an  increase  in  its  funds.  Where  are</span><span>  those  who  respond  as  they  ought  to  the  Divine</span><span>  injunction,  “Freely  ye  have  received,  freely  give,”</span><span>  —rich  in  well-doing—bountiful  in  alms,—is  the</span><span>  title  more  to  be  coveted  than  all  empty  honours,</span><span>  and  is  the  smoothest  pillow  for  the  weary  head</span><span>  and  heart  of  declining  years.  It  behoves,  then,</span><span>  every  person,  who  has  the  means,  to  come  forward</span><span>  and  support  this  meritorious  charity,  else  will</span><span>  wealth  canker  in  the  garner  of  the  holder,  and</span><span>  burden  its  possessor  like  Simonds  of  old.  Be  it</span><span>  remembered  that  the  object  of  the  Society  is  to</span><span>  promote  the  physical  and  moral  well-being  of  the</span><span>  destitute  labouring  classes,  and  that  the  principles</span><span>  of  the  Society  are  classified  in  a  few  words  of</span><span>  Scripture,  “Let  all  things  be  done  in  charity.”</span></p> ",Article,1846-07-25,THE BENEVOLENT SOCIETY.,3715006,2,2,"{'score': '1693.2809', 'value': 'very relevant'}","THE Annual General Meeting of the members of this Society was held at the Court House, North Brisbane, on Tuesday last, for the purpose of electing the annual committee, and auditing the","{'id': '14', 'value': 'The Moreton Bay Courier (Brisbane, Qld. : 1846 - 1861)'}",https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/3715006?searchTerm=%27The+Moreton+Bay+Courier%27,/newspaper/3715006,"The Moreton Bay Courier (Brisbane, Qld. : 1846 - 1861)",14
"<p><span>  OPINIONS  OF  THE  PRESS.</span></p> <p><span>  NEW  PAPER.-We  have  received  the  first  two</span><span>  numbers  of  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier,  a  paper</span><span>  published  at  Brisbane,  Moreton  Bay.  Its  outward</span><span>  appearance  is  respectable,  surpassing  the  first</span><span>  number  of  any  provincial  journal  that  has  come</span><span>  under  our  notice.  It  appears  to  be  conducted  with</span><span>  skill  and  moderation,  and  has  at  once  taken  a  firm</span><span>  stand  on  the  land  question,  which  it  avows  can</span><span>  never  be  settled  until  the  management  of  the  land</span><span>  revenue  is  vested  in  the  colonial  legislature.  Its</span><span>  local  intelligence  is  rather  scant,  but  that  will</span><span>  doubtless  be  improved  as  the  conductors  become</span><span>  more  acquainted  with  their  work.  On  the  whole,</span><span>  we  are  inclined  to  augur  favourably  of  the  More</span><span>  ton  Bay  Courier,  which  will  be  of  great  benefit  to</span><span>  the  district,  and  we  hope  yield  a  profit  to  the  pro-</span><span>  prietor.  The  second  number  of  the  Moreton  Bay</span><span>  Courier  contains  an  article  advocating,  in  strong</span><span>  terms,  the  necessity  of  establishing  a  Bank  at</span><span>  Moreton  Bay.  The  arguments  in  support  of  the</span><span>  writer's  case  are  forcible,  and  from  them  it  would</span><span>  appear  that  undoubtedly  the  establishment  of  a</span><span>  Bank  at  Brisbane  would  be  a  vast  benefit  to  the</span><span>  community,  and  would  probably  be  a  successful</span><span>  speculation  in  itself.  The  rate  of  discount  charged</span><span>  for  orders  in  money  is  stated  at  20  per  cent.,  and</span><span>  as  such  orders  are  generally  honoured  and  the</span><span>  returns  made  in  fifteen  days,  it  makes  a  rate  of</span><span>  usury  of  480  per  cent,  per  annum.  The  future</span><span>  amount  of  deposits  is  estimated  at  £120,000,  half</span><span>  of  which  it  is  presumed  will  go  to  the  labouring</span><span>  classes,  and  will  be  paid  in  orders  drawn  by  em-</span><span>  ployers  on  their  men  of  business  in  Sydney.  The</span><span>  expenses  charged  in  Sydney  for  collecting  these</span><span>  orders,  &.c,  are  generally  charged  at  2  1/2  per  cent.,</span><span>  while  the  rate  charged  by  the  Brisbane  discounter</span><span>  varies  to  20  per  cent.  ;  and  taking  it  to  average</span><span>  10  per  cent,  £6000  per  annum  is  thus  calculated</span><span>  to  be  lost  to  the  labourer  or  the  employer.  It  is</span><span>  further  correctly  argued-that  a  sufficient  and</span><span>  steady  medium  of  circulation,  provided  by  a  bank,</span><span>  would  lower  the  price  of  provisions  and  merchan-</span><span>  dise,  and  would  curtail  the  expenses  of  the  em-</span><span>  ployer,  without  infringing  on  the  actual  value  of</span><span>  the  wages  received  by  the  labourer.  It  would  also</span><span>  afford  facilities  for  the  extension  of  commercial</span><span>  enterprise,  and  would  prevent  the  inertia  of  dead</span><span>  capital-which  at  present  prevails  to  a  large  ex-</span><span>  tent  The  Courier  has  shown  great  judgment  in</span><span>  thus  early  directing  attention  to  this  important</span><span>  subject.-Sydney  Morning  Herald.</span></p> <p><span>  NEW  PAPER.-  We  have  received  the  first  two</span><span>  numbers  of  the  newly-started  paper  at  Moreton</span><span>  Bay.

Kent,</span></p> <p><span>  and  Mr.  Phelan.""</span></p> <p><span>  A  man  named  Aston  applied  for  relief  under  the</span><span>  following  circumstances:--He  had  been  tor  some</span><span>  time,  he  said,  in  the  employ  of  Messrs.  C.  and  D.</span><span>  Cameron,  at  Tarampa,  and  about  four  months</span><span>  ago  had  the  misfortune  to  be  deprived  of  his  wife,</span><span>  who  died  leaving  three  children,  one  of  them  an</span><span>  infant  in  arms.  He  had  endeavoured  to  place  the</span><span>  child  out  at  nurse,  but  had  not  succeeded,  as  no</span><span>  one  could  be  induced  to  take  charge  of  it  for  less</span><span>  than  eight  shillings  a  week.  In  consequence  of</span><span>  being  burdened  with  the  infant,  he  was  unable  to</span><span>  procure  employment,  and  considering  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  best  plan  he  could  adopt  would  be  to  proceed  to</span></p> <p><span>  Sydney,  in  order  that  the  child  might  be  admitted</span><span>  into  some  charitable  institution,  he  now  applied</span><span>  to  the  Society  to  assist  him  with  a  small  sum  to</span><span>  pay  his  passage.  After  some  discussion,  his  case</span><span>  was  referred  to  the  Acting  Committee  to  decide</span><span>  upon  the  matter  on  the  arrival  of  the  steamer.</span><span>  There  being  no  other  business  before  the  meeting</span><span>  the  members  then  separated.</span></p> <p><span>  SURVEY  OF  THE  BAY.  -Owing  to  the  boisterous</span><span>  state  of  the  weather  during  the  week,  and  the</span><span>  continued  rains,  Captain  Wickham  and  party  have</span><span>  not  been  able  to  complete  the  survey  of  the  different</span><span>  points  on  the  coast.  On  Wednesday  they  were</span><span>  compelled  through  stress  of  weather  to  run  for</span><span>  the  Pine  River,  where  they  landed  and  encamped</span></p> <p><span>  until  the  weather  moderated.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  MAGISTRACY  -On  Tuesday  last,  several  of</span><span>  the  stockholders  and  other  persons  from  the</span><span>  country  were  put  to  very  considerable  inconve-</span><span>  nience  in  consequence  of  their  being  no  magis-</span><span>  trates  on  the  Bench.  Tuesday  is  usually  con-</span><span>  sidered  a  Court-day,  and  summonses  had  been</span><span>  issued  for  the  attendance  of  suitors,  one  of  whom</span><span>  was  a  gentleman  from  the  Logan,  himself  a  ma-</span><span>  gistrate,  who,  of  course,  could  not  act  in  a  case</span><span>  in  which  he  was  personally  interested.  It  is  need-</span><span>  less  to  add  that  after  having  been  put  to  great</span><span>  expense,  besides  the  loss  of  valuable  time-doubly</span><span>  valuable  at  this  season  of  the  year-he  was  obli-</span><span>  ged  to  return  to  his  station  without  having  ac-</span><span>  complished  the  object  of  his  visit  to  town.  The</span><span>  only  excuse  than  can  be  offered  for  the  magis-</span><span>  trates  is,  that  Captain  Wickham  has  been  engaged</span><span>  during  the  week  in  surveying  certain  points  in</span><span>  the  Bay,  and  was,  we  believe,  prevented  by  the</span><span>  boisterous  state  of  the  weather  from  reaching</span><span>  town.  With  respect  to  Lieut.  Blamire,  the  other</span><span>  resident  magistrate,  we  are  not  aware  of  the</span><span>  reason  why  he  did  not  attend.  We  trust,  how-</span><span>  ever,  for  the  sake  of  public  convenience,  that  he</span><span>  will  see  the  propriety  of  attending  to  his  magis-</span><span>  terial  duties,  whenever  the  Police  Magistrate  is</span><span>  unavoidably  absent.  Verbum  sat.</span></p> <p><span>  DOGS.-We  believe  it  is  not  generally  known</span><span>  that  all  licenses  for  dogs  expired  on  the  30th  ult.,</span><span>  it  will,  therefore,  be  necessary  for  persons  who</span><span>  purpose  registering  their  dogs  to  do  so  imme-</span><span>  diately,  or  they  will  be  liable  to  be  fined.  The</span><span>  forms  can  be  procured  at  the  office  of  this  journal.</span></p> <p><span>  ESTIMATES.-The  following  sums  for  the  year</span><span>  1847,  for  the  District  of  Moreton  Bay,  have  been</span><span>  voted  by  the  Council  :-District  Commissioner  for</span><span>  Court  of  Requests,  and  Registrar,  £25  each.</span><span>  Harbour  Master,  at  4s.  6d.  per  diem,  £82  2s.  6d.  ;</span><span>  provisions  and  clothing  for  boatmen,  £160  ;  in-</span><span>  cidental  expenses,  £40.</span></p> <p><span>  POSTAL  ARRANGEMENTS.-In  consequence  of</span><span>  ill  health,  Mr.  Slade,  the  postmaster,  applied  a  few</span><span>  weeks  since  for  leave  of  absence  for  three  months.</span><span>  By  the  last  steamer  Mr.  Slade  received  a  letter</span><span>  from  the  Postmaster  General,  intimating  that  his</span><span>  request  would  be  complied  with,  and  desiring  him</span><span>  to  instruct  Mr.  Louis  Layard,  who  has  been  ap-</span><span>  pointed  Mr.  Slade's  locum  tenens,  in  the  duties</span><span>  of  his  office.  Mr.  Slade  has  been  upwards  of</span><span>  twenty-seven  years  in  the  service  of  Government,</span><span>  and  during  the  whole  of  that  long  period  has  not</span><span>  applied  for  a  single  day's  leave.  Should  he</span><span>  return  to  this  place,  which  depends  on  a  contin-</span><span>  gency,  we  trust  it  will  be  with  renovated  strength</span><span>  to  enable  him  to  resume  his  multifarious  duties.</span></p> <p><span>  SALE  OF  CATTLE.-The  herd  of  cattle  the  pro-</span><span>  perty  of  the  late  E.  E.  Dalrymple,  Esq.,  consist-</span><span>  ing  of  355  head,  was  disposed  of  at  public  auction</span><span>  on  Thursday.  There  was  no  competition,  and  the</span><span>  lot  was  sold  to  Captain  Wickham  at  £1  per  head.</span><span>  Calves  under  six  months  were  given  in.</span></p> <p><span>  SALE  OF  FURNITURE.-The  sale  of  household</span><span>  furniture  and  other  effects,  the  property  of  Mr.</span><span>  Slade,  took  place  on  Monday.  There  was  a  nu-</span><span>  merous  attendance  of  buyers,  and  the  various  ar-</span><span>  ticles  fetched  capital  prices.</span></p> <p><span>  WAGES  CASE.-At  the  Police  Office,  yesterday,</span><span>  a  person,  named  Patrick  Meham,  summoned  Mr.</span><span>  John  Campbell,  of  Kangaroo  Point,  for  non-</span><span>  payment  of  wages,  amounting  to  £6  1s.  3d.  The</span><span>  Magistrates,  decided  that  the  claim  had  been  sub-</span><span>  stantiated,  and  ordered  judgment  to  be  entered  for</span><span>  the  full  amount  and  costs,  the  usual  time  to  be</span><span>  allowed  for  payment.</span></p> <p><span>  BREACHES  OF  THE  HIRED  SERVANTS'  Act.  --</span></p> <p><span>  At  the  Police  Office,  yesterday,  a  man,  named</span><span>  William  Smith,  who  had  been  remanded  on  Tues-</span><span>  day  last,  in  consequence  of  the  non-attendance  of</span><span>  Magistrates  was  again  placed  at  the  bar,  charged</span><span>  by  Colin  J.  Mackenzie,  Esq.,  of  Kilcoy,  with</span><span>  having  absconded  from  his  hired  service  on  the  3rd</span><span>  instant.  Mr.  Mackenzie  stated  that  the  man  had</span><span>  lost  47  sheep,  and  had  overdrawn  his  account  to</span><span>  the  amount  of  £3  18s.  The  defendant  made  no</span></p> <p><span>  reply  to  the  charge,  but  pleaded  in  mitigation  of</span><span>  punishment  that  he  had  a  large  family  to  support.</span><span>  The  Bench  said,  that  this  was  a  most  flagrant</span><span>  case,  and  as  the  defendant  had  no  excuse  for  his</span><span>  conduct,  they  should  send  him  to  the  House  of</span><span>  Correction,  in  Sydney,  there  to  be  confined  for</span><span>  three  months.  This  case  deserves  special  notice</span><span>  at  our  hands.  As  soon  as  Mr.  Mackenzie  had</span><span>  ascertained  that  the  man  had  absconded,  instant</span><span>  pursuit  was  resolved  on.  Mr.  Mackenzie,  accom-</span><span>  panied  by  his  superintendent,  succeeded  in  tracing</span><span>  him  to  the  Cunningham's  Gap  road,  and  on</span><span>  reaching  Reynold's  Creek,  the  object  of  their</span><span>  search  was  observed  crossing  the  creek.  Being</span><span>  resolved  upon  his  capture,  the  party  dismounted,</span><span>  and  the  ""darbies""  were  put  in  request.  After</span><span>  some  resistance  from  the  fellow,  who  drew  out</span><span>  a  pistol,  and  threatened  to  shoot  them,  he  was</span><span>  with  some  difficulty  secured,  and  brought  to  Lime-</span><span>  stone,  from  which  place  he  was  forwarded  by  the</span><span>  steamer  to  Brisbane,  and  placed  in  the  Lock-up.</span><span>  If  all  the  squatters  were  to  act  with  equal  prompt  -</span><span>  tude  and  resolution,  it  would  operate  as  an  effectual</span><span>  check  to  runaways  from  the  various  stations.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  HUNTER  RIVER.-The  broad  bed  of  this</span><span>  river,  which  for  so  many  months  had  been  little</span><span>  else  but  a  pebbly  desert,  is  now  transformed  into</span><span>  a  wide  and  noble  river.  The  fresh  reached</span><span>  Maitland  on  Saturday  morning,  the  first  ap-</span><span>  pearance  being  the  thickening  of  the  waters  from</span><span>  the  mud  that  the  stream  brought  down.  This</span><span>  was  about  half-past  eleven,  and  by  one  o'clock</span><span>  the  river  had  risen  three  feet.  By  the  following</span><span>  day  the  water  rose  upwards  of  two  feet  more,  the</span><span>  stream  coming  down  still  more  rapid  and  muddy.</span><span>  and  having  the  appearance  of  very  strong  thick</span><span>  lye.  On  Monday  it  had  risen  about  eight  feet.</span><span>  The  fishes,  too,  might  be  seen  in  thousands  lying</span><span>  sick  on  the  top  of  the  water.  Yesterday  evening'</span><span>  the  river  had  fallen  two  or  three  feet.-Maitland</span><span>  Mercury,  September  30.</span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  Colonial  Manufactures.-About  five  years</span><span>  ago  the  first  iron  press  for  a  newspaper  was</span><span>  manufactured  in  Sydney,  under  the  superinten-</span><span>  dence  of  one  of  the  present  proprietors  of  this</span><span>  journal,  by  Mr.  Creighton,  engineer  ;  and  after</span><span>  being  used  a  considerable  period  in  their  office,</span><span>  for  jobbing  purposes,  was  conveyed  to  Windsor,</span><span>  where  for  the  past  two  years  it  has  been  used  not</span><span>  only  for  jobbing,  but  to  work  off  the  Courier,  a</span><span>  weekly  paper,  established  by  the  proprietors  of</span><span>  the  Australian,  in  July,  1844,  but  now  the  pro-</span><span>  perly  of  Mr.  G.  A.  Eager.  The  press  improves,</span><span>  and  will  continue  to  improve,  for  some  time  to</span><span>  come,  the  more  it  is  used  by  the  worthy  proprietor</span><span>  -one  of  the  oldest  members  of  the  Press  in  this</span><span>  part  of  the  globe.  We  have  now  to  notice  a  second</span><span>  press,  manufactured  by  the  same  engineer,  of</span><span>  rather  larger  dimensions,  commonly  known  to</span><span>  printers  as  double-crown  ;  but  on  the  same  prin-</span><span>  ciple,  with  a  slight  but  material  exception  in  the</span><span>  increased  length  of  pull  by  the  bar-handle,  which</span><span>  certainly  is  not  an  improvement,  especially  in</span><span>  these  times  of  extraordinary  expedition.  However,</span><span>  now  that  we  can  manufacture  hand  presses  in  the</span><span>  colony,  we  trust  our  friends  at  home  will  send  out</span><span>  no  more  consignments  in  that  line.  During  the</span><span>  past  fortnight  the  opinions  of  professed  billiard</span><span>  players  have  been  taken  upon  the  excellence  of  a</span><span>  table,  manufactured  by  Mr.  A.  Steel,  of  Castle-</span><span>  reagh-street,  which  on  sufficient  evidence  we  are</span><span>  prepared  to  pronounce  equal  to  most,  and  superior</span><span>  to  many  of  the  imported  billiard  tables.  Every-</span><span>  thing  connected  with  the  table  alluded  to,  is  of</span><span>  colonial  manufacture,  save  the  cloth,  which,  al-</span><span>  though  we  have  the  raw  material,  we  cannot  yet</span><span>  produce  in  sufficient  excellence  through  a  want  of</span><span>  the  necessary  machinery  and  labour.  The  bed  of</span><span>  this  table  is  of  polished  colonial  marble,  prepared</span><span>  by  Mr.  Patten  of  Pitt-street,  sculptor.  If  we</span><span>  cannot  produce  within  ourselves  all  that  our</span><span>  cravings  demand;  it  is  now  very  clear  that  all  the</span><span>  reasonable  wants  of  man  in  this  colony,  if  they</span><span>  are  not,  can  easily  be  met,  if  the  colonists  will  but</span><span>  put  their  shoulders  to  the  wheel-""  the  wheel  of</span><span>  fortune.""-Australian.-[The  second  press  al-</span><span>  luded  to  in  the  above  paragraph  is  now  in  use  at</span><span>  the  office  of  this  journal,  and  answers  extremely</span><span>  well.

The  volume  contains  a</span><span>  vast  deal  of  information,  respecting  the  various</span><span>  London  and  provincial  newspapers,  and  commu-</span><span>  nicates  a  number  of  statistical  facts,  regarding</span><span>  the  counties  and  districts  in  which  they  circulate.</span><span>  The  peculiar  characteristics  of  every  journal  are</span></p> <p><span>  stated:  a  valuable  section  of  the  work  is  devoted</span><span>  to  the  ""  philosophy  of  advertising,""  and  we  lay</span><span>  before  our  readers  the  two  rules  which  the  author</span><span>  sets  forth  for  the  guidance  of  advertisers  :-""  1.</span><span>  That  advertising  is  of  no  party.""  The  advertiser</span><span>  looks  for  notoriety,  for  publicity-for  benefits--</span></p> <p><span>  from  the  expense  he  goes  to  in  advertising.  He</span><span>  should,  therefore,  not  confine  his  advertisements</span><span>  to  those  journals  which  may  advocate  the  same</span><span>  principles  he  himself  professes,  but  look  to  that</span><span>  most  likely  to  promote  his  interests  ;  unless,  in-</span><span>  deed,  he  advertises  for  expressly  sectarian,  or</span><span>  peculiarly  party  political  purposes  :  and  even</span><span>  then,  we  question  whether  the  full  benefit  of  ad-</span><span>  vertising  can  be  served,  by  confining  it  exclusively</span><span>  to  papers  of  the  religious  or  political  principles</span><span>  which  are  sought  to  be  promoted.  We  should,  in</span><span>  such  cases,  insert  our  advertisements  in  papers  of</span><span>  opposite  opinions  :  not  to  the  same  extent,  as  in</span><span>  those  which  took  similar  views  as  ourselves  ;  but</span><span>  certainly  we  should  take  care  that,  the  subject  to</span><span>  which  we  wish  to  give  publicity,  should  be  known</span><span>  as  well  amongst  enemies  as  amongst  friends.  2.</span><span>  The  second  rule  to  which  we  should  advise  adver-</span><span>  tisers  to  adhere  is,  in  looking  at  the  circulation  of</span><span>  the  paper  to  which  their  attention  is  directed  as</span><span>  an  advertising  medium,  is  to  regard  its  quality</span><span>  rather  than  its  quantity.  Some  of  the  most</span><span>  widely  circulated  journals  in  the  empire  are  the</span><span>  worst  possible  to  advertise  in.  Their  readers  are</span><span>  not  purchasers  ;  and  any  money  spent  upon  them</span><span>  is  so  much  thrown  away.  A  journal  that  circu-</span><span>  lates  amongst  the  families  of  the  district;  one</span><span>  which  has  the  confidence  of  the  monied  and  re-</span><span>  spectable,  classes  of  society  ;  one  which  from  its</span><span>  character,  is  likely  to  be  read  attentively  by  its</span><span>  circle  of  readers-in  their  own  houses-at  their</span><span>  own  fire-sides,  whilst  it  also  finds  access  to  the</span><span>  news-rooms  and  libraries  of  its  locality  -  is  a</span><span>  better  medium  of  advertising,  with  a  circulation</span><span>  of  2,000  than  another  with  a  circulation  of  4,000,</span><span>  that  circulation  being  chiefly  confined  to  inns,</span><span>  public-houses,  and  beer-shops.  The  reason  is</span><span>  this  :  readers  at  home  look  to  advertisements  as  a</span><span>  part  of  the  contents  of  the  paper  in  which  they</span><span>  may  be  interested,  and  almost  always  refer  to</span><span>  them.  The  same  may  be  said  of  the  frequenters</span><span>  of  reading-rooms  and  libraries-generally  men</span><span>  of  business,  who  want  to  see  a  number  of  local</span><span>  journals  for  the  advantage  of  their  business  an-</span><span>  nouncements  ;  but  readers  at  public-houses,  it</span><span>  will  be  found,  as  a  rule,  read  for  the  news  and  the</span><span>  politics,  not  for  the  advertisements  :  a  long  and</span><span>  close  observation  warrants  us  in  coming  to  this</span><span>  conclusion.""  It  would  be  well  for  advertisers  to</span><span>  keep  the  foregoing  rules  in  view.  They  require</span><span>  that  their  announcements  should  meet  the  eye  of</span><span>  that  class  of  persons  who  need  the  articles  offered</span><span>  for  sale,  and  which  has  the  means  of  purchasing</span><span>  their  wares.  We  have  satisfaction  in  being  able</span><span>  to  say  that  this  journal  possesses  these  requisites</span><span>  to  as  large  an  extent  as  any  provincial  paper  in</span><span>  tire  colony.  The  quality  of  its  circulation  gives</span><span>  it  as  decided  a  superiority,  as,  an  advertising  me-</span><span>  dium,  as  its  quantity,  for  it  is  circulated  among</span><span>  the  monied  and  respectable  classes  in  all  parts  of</span></p> <p><span>  Australasia.</span></p> <p><span>  A  letter  from  Jerusalem  states  that  in  conse-</span><span>  quence  of  the  long  continued  drought,  the  water</span><span>  absolutely  necessary  for  a  family,  cost  ten  shillings</span><span>  a  day.</span></p> <p><span>  CUSTOMS  ACT  AMENDMENT  BILL  -  On  the</span><span>  30th  ult.,  in  the  Legislative  Council,  a  question</span><span>  arose,  upon  the  consideration  of  the  second  clause</span><span>  in  this  Bill,  as  to  the  limits  within  which  vessels</span><span>  recognised  as  coasters  should  trade,  and  it  was</span><span>  suggested  that  the  boundaries  should  be  so  defined</span><span>  as  to  exclude  the  new  colony  of  Northern  Aus-</span><span>  tralia.  This  was  objected  to  by  Mr.  Windeyer  as</span><span>  extremely  inconvenient.  Many  of  the  settlers,</span><span>  he  said,  had  stock  beyond  the  proposed  limits,</span><span>  and  received  their  supplies  at  Wide  Bay,  or  other</span><span>  ports  to  the  northward,  sending  their  wool  in</span><span>  return,  and  it  would  be  very  hard  if  the  vessels</span><span>  through  the  medium  of  which  this  was  done  were</span><span>  to  be  considered  as  foreign  traders.  Moreover,  it</span><span>  did  not  follow  that  the  new  settlement  in  the  north</span><span>  would  be  a  distinct  colony,  in  the  strict  sense  of</span><span>  the  term,  so  as  to  require  that  vessels  trading  from</span><span>  thence  should  cease  to  be  regarded  as  coasters.</span><span>  The  Colonial  Secretary  remarked  that  any  new</span><span>  colony  which  might  be  founded  by  her  Majesty</span><span>  must  be  strictly  a  separate  colony  from  New  South</span><span>  Wales,  for  it  was  only  by  erecting  a  distinct  colony</span><span>  that  Her  Majesty  could  exercise  the  power  con-</span><span>  ferred  upon  her  in  this  behalf  by  the  Imperial</span><span>  Legislature  ;  and  although  the  officer  at  the  head</span><span>  of  the  Government  might  be  placed  under  the  su-</span><span>  pervision  of  the  Governor  of  New  South  Wales,</span><span>  it  would  be  necessary  to  create  a  distinct  colonial</span><span>  legislature,  who  might  make  such  provision  as</span><span>  they  thought  fit,  so  that  that  House  would  have</span><span>  no  legislative  control  beyond  the  limits  of  New</span><span>  South  Wales.  He  had  ascertained  that  no  part  of</span><span>  the  Government  business  of  the  northern  colony</span><span>  was  to  be  transacted  through  his  office.  Mr.</span><span>  Windeyer  then  suggested  that  until  different  ar-</span><span>  rangements  might  be  made  by  the  Legislature  of</span><span>  the  new  colony,  the  vessels  which  traded  to  the</span><span>  northward  between  Cape  Capricorn  and  the  eastern</span><span>  limits  of  South  Australia  should  be  regarded  as</span><span>  coasters,  which,  after  some  further  discussion,</span><span>  was  agreed  to.</span></p> ",Article,1846-10-17,LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.

So  she</span><span>  went  to  the  Lords,  and  she  said,  --</span></p> <p><span>  ""  Lords,  Lords,  repeal  this  law,  or  I  cannot</span></p> <p><span>  get  cheap  bread  for  my  babies.""</span></p> <p><span>  Then  the  Lords  said  to  her,  ""Pooh!  we  are</span><span>  the  landed  interest  ;  what  do  we  care  for  your</span><span>  babies  ?

The  whole  are</span><span>  very  large  and  well-conditioned.</span></p> <p><span>  BREACH  OF  HIRED  SERVANTS'  ACT.—At  the</span><span>  Police-office  yesterday,  a  man  named  William</span><span>  George  Lewis,  in  the  employ  of  Mr.  John  Camp-</span></p> <p><span>  bell,  at  Kangaroo  Point,  appeared  to  answer  a</span><span>  complaint  preferred  against  him  by  that  gentle-</span><span>  man  for  disobedience  of  orders,  and  making  use</span><span>  of  abusive  and  slanderous  language,  Mr.  Adams,</span><span>  who  appeared  on  the  part  of  the  complainant,  re-</span><span>  minded  the  magistrates,  that  this  was  the  first</span><span>  charge  that  had  been  brought  before  them  under</span><span>  the  new  Masters  and  Servants  Act,  and  he  hoped,</span><span>  as  it  was  a  very  gross  case,  that  they  would  inflict</span><span>  such  punishment  as  would  deter  others  in  Mr.</span><span>  Campbell's  employ  from  following  the  bad  ex-</span><span>  ample  set  them  by  the  defendant.  Evidence</span><span>  having  been  adduced,  the  charge  was  fully  proved,</span><span>  and  the  defendant  was  sentenced  to  three  months'</span><span>  imprisonment.</span></p> <p><span>  CHARGE  OF  RAPE.—On  Thursday,  John  Curtis,</span><span>  a  private  belonging  to  the  detachment  of  the  99th</span><span>  Regiment  stationed  at  Brisbane,  under  commit-</span><span>  ment  for  trial  on  a  charge  of  attempting  to  violate</span><span>  the  person  of  a  child  under  ten  years  of  age,  the</span><span>  daughter  of  Sergeant  Cook  of  the  same  regiment,</span><span>  was  forwarded  to  Sydney  by  the  William.  He</span><span>  has  been  some  time  in  custody  since  his  commit-</span><span>  ment,  owing  to  our  limited  police  force  not  per-</span><span>  mitting  the  absence  of  a  constable  to  take  charge</span><span>  of  him  to  Sydney  ;  the  Captain  of  the  Tamar</span><span>  having,  as  might  have  been  expected,  declined  to</span><span>  become  a  special  constable  for  the  occasion.  Ano-</span><span>  ther  instance  of  that  ""  penny-wise  and  pound</span><span>  foolish""  system  of  which  Moreton  Bay  presents</span><span>  so  many  examples.</span></p> <p><span>  AN  INCORRIGIBLE  —At  the  Police-office  yester-</span><span>  day,  a  man  named  James  McAuliffe,  whose  strange</span><span>  vagaries  have  obtained  for  him  the  sobriquet  of</span><span>  the  Cranky  Cobbler,  was  placed  at  the  bar,  charged</span><span>  with  drunkeness  and  disorderly  conduct.  McAuliffe</span><span>  is  well  known  as  the  most  noisy  individual  in  the</span><span>  district.  He  was  fined  twenty  shillings  and  costs,</span><span>  and  in  default  of  payment  was  committed  to  the</span><span>  cells  for  forty-eight  hours.</span></p> <p><span>  TURTLE.—A  very  large  turtle,  weighing  up-</span><span>  wards  of  four  cwt.,  was  taken  in  the  Bay  on</span><span>  Thursday  last.  The  turtle  season  has  just  com-</span><span>  menced.  A  gentleman  who  arrived  here  a  few</span><span>  days  ago,  from  Amity  Point,  informed  us  that  he</span><span>  has  seen  turtle  in  the  shallow  water  near  Moreton</span><span>  Island  of  enormous  size.  He  witnessed  an  at-</span><span>  tempt  to  capture  one  of  these  monsters  by  the</span><span>  aborigines  ;  but  notwithstanding  six  of  them  used</span><span>  their  utmost  exertions  to  secure  him,  he  escaped.</span><span>  There  are  two  kinds  which  frequent  the  Bay,  the</span><span>  hawks-bill  and  the  green  turtle  ;  the  latter  of</span><span>  which,  the  most  highly  prized,  can  be  procured</span><span>  easily.  The  bad  success  which  has  attended  the</span><span>  shipments  of  turtle  to  Sydney,  seems  to  have</span><span>  rendered  the  Bay  fishermen  careless  of  taking</span><span>  them.  We  hope,  however,  that  some  speculative</span><span>  individual  will  shortly  commence  the  manufactory</span><span>  of  turtle  soup,  for  general  exportation  ;  there  is</span><span>  no  doubt  that  his  gains  would  be  very  considera-</span><span>  ble.  Industry  and  skill  would  be  the  only  capital</span><span>  required.  A  person  in  the  West  Indies,  who  car-</span><span>  ries  on  an  establishment  of  this  kind,  in  which  is</span><span>  made  what  he  terms  ""  Turtle  Soup  for  the  Million,""</span><span>  packed  in  tins,  hermetically  sealed,  and  shipped</span><span>  to  England,  is  realizing  an  enormous  fortune.</span></p> <p><span>  BOILING-DOWN.—HORSES.—The  fat  of  a  horse,</span><span>  when  boiled,  becomes  an  excellent  oil,  much  prized</span><span>  by  curriers,  and  used  in  various  manufactures.</span><span>  It  is  worth,  in  the  colony,  about  six  shillings  per</span><span>  gallon.  We  trust  this  hint  will  not  be  lost  on  the</span><span>  owners  of  those  weedy,  worthless  brutes,  which</span><span>  are  to  be  found  in  such  great  numbers  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  Middle  District.</span></p> <p><span>  BREACH  OF  THE  PUBLICANS'  ACT.—At  the</span><span>  Police-office,  yesterday,  Mr.  Rowland,  of  the</span><span>  South  Brisbane  Hotel,  appeared  to  answer  an  in-</span><span>  formation  which  had  been  filed  against  him  for</span><span>  suffering  cards  to  be  played  in  his  house  on  the</span><span>  night  of  the  23rd  instant.  Mr.  Rowland  admitted</span><span>  the  offence,  and  was  mulcted  in  the  lowest  penalty</span><span>  of  forty  shillings  and  costs.  The  fine  was  im-</span><span>  mediately  paid  by  the  mutual  contributions  of  the</span><span>  gentlemen  who  had  been  present  on  the  occasion.</span></p> <p><span>  DOGS.—His  Excellency  the  Governor  has  di-</span><span>  rected  it  to  be  notified  that  the  provisions  of  the</span><span>  Act  of  Council,  intituled,  ""  An  Act  for  abating</span><span>  the  nuisances  occasioned  by  dogs  in  the  streets  of</span><span>  certain  towns  and  highways  in  New  South  Wales,""</span><span>  have  been  extended  to  the  town  of  Brisbane,  in</span><span>  the  county  of  Stanley.  An  abstract  of  this  Act</span><span>  will  shortly  appear  in  the  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  ROBBERY.—On  Thursday  night,  last  week,  an</span><span>  out-building  adjoining  the  stores  of  Mr.  Hampden</span><span>  in  South  Brisbane  was  entered  by  some  dishonest</span><span>  person.  Fortunately  it  was  empty,  and  the  fellow</span><span>  found  nothing  portable  but  the  window  sash,</span><span>  which  he  carried  off.  One  of  the  aborigines  was</span><span>  put  on  the  track  early  in  the  following  morning,</span><span>  but  as  the  footsteps  led  to  a  cottage  occupied  by  a</span><span>  person  in  a  respectable  station  of  life,  no  further</span><span>  attempt  was  made  to  recover  the  stolen  property.</span></p> <p><span>  CRICKET.—As  a  finale  to  the  amusements  of  the</span><span>  race  week,  a  challenge  from  eleven  of  the  working</span><span>  men  of  Brisbane  to  play  an  equal  number  of  gen-</span><span>  tlemen,  for  £5  10s.  a  side,  was  accepted  by  the</span><span>  latter,  and  the  match  came  off  on  the  Terrace</span><span>  leading  to  the  Government  Gardens.  The  gen-</span><span>  tlemen  were  successful,  beating  their  opponents</span><span>  easily.  The  stakes  were  generously  handed  over</span><span>  to  the  losing  party.  Arrangements  were  made</span><span>  for  another  match  to  come  off  in  the  next  year's</span></p> <p><span>  race  week.</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><span>  THE  OLD  BURIAL  GROUNDS.—In  reference  to  a</span><span>  paragraph  in  our  last  number  we  are  glad  to</span><span>  learn  that  the  inhabitants  are  in  no  way  to  blame</span><span>  for  the  burnt  fence,  broken  tombstones,  and  trod-</span><span>  den  mounds,  which  shock  the  eye  of  the  stranger</span><span>  at  the  place  known  as  the  Old  Burial  Ground.</span><span>  Those  whose  remains  are  interred  within  it  were</span><span>  either  Government  officials  or  prisoners  of  the</span><span>  Crown.  The  burial-place  accessible  to  the  in-</span><span>  habitants  is  farther  removed  from  the  town,  and</span><span>  is  kept  with  scrupulous  care.  Reproach,  there-</span><span>  fore,  cannot  rest  with  them.  We  have  heard  that</span><span>  the  Government  have  once  or  twice  protected  the</span><span>  ground  with  a  fence,  which  has  been  shortly  af-</span><span>  terwards  pulled  down  by  the  blacks,  brought  by</span><span>  them  into  the  town,  and  sold  for  firewood  ;  and</span><span>  that  those  interested  therefore  consider  farther</span><span>  attempts  to  be  hopeless.  We  trust,  however,  that</span><span>  one  more  effort  will  be  made  to  rescue  Brisbane</span><span>  from  the  stigma  which  now  seemingly  attaches</span><span>  to  it.  The  Old  Burial  Ground  is  the  last</span><span>  earthly  resting-place  of  many  an  useful  and</span><span>  respected  public  servant—the  martyr  Stapylton,</span><span>  and  numerous  others—and  should  there  be</span><span>  any  amongst  us,  who  will  venture  to  assert</span><span>  that  their  remains  deserved  no  better  fate,  we</span><span>  would  ask,  Do  you  wish  that,  when  you  die,</span><span>  their  fate  shall  be  yours  —  that  the  mound</span><span>  over  the  simple  grave  to  which  you  may  be  borne</span><span>  by  your  sorrowing  friends,  shall  be  trampled  into</span><span>  a  shapeless  mass,  its  tombstone  broken  and  dis-</span><span>  placed,  and  the  few  flowering  plants  which  affec-</span><span>  tion  had  taught  to  twine  around  it,  uprooted</span><span>  and  withered  ?  To  such  a  question  there  can</span><span>  only  be  one  reply.  We  repeat,  therefore,</span><span>  that  we  hope  our  respected  authorities  will  make</span><span>  another  trial  once  more  enclose  the  ground  with</span><span>  a  substantial  fence.  And  should  any  amongst</span><span>  us  be  heartless  enough  to  encourage  the  blacks  to</span><span>  destroy  it,  we  shall  feel  it  our  duty  to  hold  his</span><span>  conduct  up  to  public  reprobation.  Desecration  of</span><span>  the  dead  is  opposed  to  the  practice  both  of  civilized</span><span>  and  savage  man—the  laws  of  Nature,  Necessity,</span><span>  and  Society,  stand  opposed  to  an  act  which  in  its</span><span>  enormity  strikes  at  the  best  and  tenderest  feelings</span><span>  of  humanity.</span></p> <p><span>  WORKING  BULLOCKS.—Seven  working  bullocks</span><span>  belonging  to  the  Survey  Department  were  sold  by</span><span>  public  auction  on  Monday  last,  and  fetched  two</span><span>  pounds  eighteen  shillings  per  head.  They  were</span><span>  in  very  poor  condition.</span></p> <p><span>  BILLIARD  LICENSE.—On  Tuesday  the  magis-</span><span>  trates  granted  a  renewal  of  the  billiard  license</span><span>  for  the  room  at  the  Victoria  Hotel,  with  permis-</span><span>  sion  to  keep  it  open  until  two  o'clock  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  morning.</span></p> <p><span>  HIGHWAY  ROBBERY.—We  observe  by  a  para-</span><span>  graph  in  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald,  that  a</span><span>  few  days  ago  a  person  named  William  Horseman,</span><span>  who  had  lately  arrived  from  Moreton  Bay,  was</span><span>  knocked  down  and  robbed  on  the  South  Head</span><span>  Road,  he  being  at  the  time  in  a  state  of  intoxica-</span><span>  tion.  It  is  but  right  to  state,  lest  any  misap-</span><span>  prehension  should  prevail,  that  the  individual</span></p> <p><span>  alluded  to  is  not  connected  with  Mr.  Thomas</span><span>  Horseman  of  Ipswich  ;  nor  is  he  known  to  any</span><span>  of  the  residents  here,  as  we  have  made  many</span><span>  enquiries  respecting  him.</span></p> <p><span>  WILSON'S  CAPTURE.—A  number  of  gentlemen,</span><span>  connected  with  the  Clarence  River  and  Darling</span><span>  Downs  districts,  who  were  in  Sydney  at  the  time</span><span>  the  news  arrived  of  the  death  of  Wilson  the  bush-</span><span>  ranger  and  the  capture  of  his  party,  by  a  party</span><span>  of  mounted  police,  among  the  ranges  at  the  head</span><span>  of  the  Clarence  River,  subscribed  the  sum  of  £37.</span><span>  This  they  entrusted  to  the  Commandant  of  the</span><span>  Police,  requesting  that  it  might  be  equally  dis-</span><span>  tributed  amongst  his  men,  as  a  token  of  the  esti-</span><span>  mation  in  which  their  bravery  and  perseverance</span><span>  are  held  by  the  settlers.</span></p> <p><span>  RECOVERY  OF  SMALL  DEBTS.—Mr.  Windeyer</span></p> <p><span>  has  introduced  a  Bill  into  the  Legislative  Council,</span><span>  to  amend  the  law  respecting  the  recovery  of  small</span><span>  debts  in  all  parts  of  the  colony,  except  the  county  of</span><span>  Cumberland.  It  provides,  1st,  that  Courts  of  Petty</span><span>  Sessions  shall  be  Courts  of  Requests,  for  debts  not</span><span>  exceeding  ten  pounds,  with  certain  exceptions  and</span><span>  limitations,  which  attach  to  the  existing  law.</span><span>  2nd,  That  a  single  Magistrate  shall  have  juris-</span><span>  diction  up  to  the  amount  of  forty  shillings,  or  to</span><span>  a  higher  amount,  with  the  consent  of  the  parties.</span><span>  3rd,  The  Clerks  of  Benches  shall  act  as  Registrars,</span><span>  and  receive  the  fees  provided  in  the  schedules  at-</span><span>  tached  to  the  Act,  providing  they  do  not  exeeed  a</span><span>  certain  specified  sum  in  one  year.  The  remainder</span><span>  of  the  clauses,  amounting  to  thirty-five,  are  con-</span><span>  fined  to  the  details  of  modes  of  proceeding,  service</span><span>  of  summonses,  parties  liable,  costs  how  paid,  and</span><span>  process  of  execution—none  of  which  are  essen-</span><span>  tially  different  from  the  Act  now  in  force,  except</span><span>  the  service  of  summons,  which  is  required  to  be</span><span>  personal.</span></p> <p><span>  AUSTRALIAN  CONCENTRATED  SOUP.—We  have</span><span>  met  with  the  subjoined  remarks  in  the  city  article</span><span>  of  the  London  Observer,  of  the  28th  December.</span><span>  Our  readers  will,  we  are  sure,  participate  in  our</span><span>  feelings  of  regret  at  the  oppressive,  and,  as  the</span><span>  Observer  justly  calls  it,  the  ""  enormous""  duty</span><span>  levied  upon  a  product  coming  from  a  British</span><span>  colony,  and  adapted  so  especially  to  supply  the</span><span>  British  poor  with  a  species  of  food  at  once  nutriti-</span><span>  ous,  palatable,  and  cheap.  If  this  obnoxious  im-</span><span>  post  were  removed,  the  demand  would  be  very</span><span>  extensive,  for  the  colony  could  afford  to  supply  the</span><span>  article  at  a  price  which  in  England  would  be  con-</span><span>  sidered  low,  although  leaving  a  handsome  profit  to</span><span>  the  colonists.  ""  Since  the  public  notice  that  has</span><span>  been  given  of  the  importation  of  the  Australian</span><span>  concentrated  soup,  several  noblemen  and  other</span><span>  philanthropic  individuals  have  been  desirous  of</span><span>  securing  a  quantity  for  distribution  amongst  the</span><span>  poor,  which  intention  is  partly  frustrated  by  the</span><span>  enormous  duty  levied  by  the  Customs,  namely,  an</span><span>  ad  valorem  one  of  20  per  cent.,  as  a  manufactured</span><span>  article,  which  is  disproportionate  to  its  value,  and</span><span>  when  we  find  that  poultry  and  game  of  all  kinds</span><span>  are  brought  in  from  foreign  countries  at  a  nominal</span><span>  ad  valorem  duty  of  5  per  cent.,  and  principally</span><span>  consumed  by  the  affluent,  and  the  article  in  ques-</span><span>  tion  is  exclusively  intended  for  distribution</span><span>  amongst  the  poor,  surely  this  anomaly  should  not</span><span>  exist.  It  is  useless  appealing  to  the  Customs</span><span>  authorities,  for  they  have  no  alternative  but  to  levy</span><span>  the  duty  according  to  Act  of  Parliament  ;  but  an</span><span>  article  of  importation  that  serves  the  interest  of</span><span>  two  parties-our  colonies  and  the  poor  at  home</span><span>  ought  to  be  placed  on  the  more  favourable  footing</span><span>  by  a  mere  nominal  duty  being  levied.""—Sydney</span><span>  Herald.—[Sir  R.  Peel's  new  Tariff  Bill  proposes</span><span>  that  the  duty  on  gelatine,  in  which  term  concen-</span><span>  trated  soup  is  included,  shall  immediately  ""  cease</span><span>  and  determine.""  This  is  a  matter  of  no  small</span><span>  importance  to  our  stockholders.—ED  M.  B.  C.]</span></p> <p><span>  COLONIAL  PRODUCE.—Messrs.  Goad  and  Rigg</span><span>  of  London,  the  eminent  brokers,  in  their  annual</span><span>  circular,  state  that  ""  Australian  tallow  is  now</span><span>  looked  upon  with  alarm  by  those  who  have  unin-</span><span>  terruptedly  swayed  the  English  market  for  so</span><span>  many  years,  inasmuch  as  they  can  neither  ascer-</span><span>  tain  the  amount  of  supply  nor  the  precise  time</span><span>  when  it  may  be  expected,  so  that  all  their  former</span><span>  calculations  are  defeated,  and  instead  of  being  a</span><span>  monopoly,  the  tallow  market  is  now  regulated,  by</span><span>  supplies  from  various  sources  which  cannot  be</span><span>  controlled.""  The  total  quantity  received  in</span><span>  England  from  the  colony  last  year  amounted  to</span><span>  3630  tons,  which  is  estimated  to  have  produced</span><span>  gross  £146,000,  against  68,000  in  1844.  The</span><span>  market  was  in  a  healthy  condition,  and  the  ag-</span><span>  gregate  stock  of  foreign  tallow  did  not  exceed</span><span>  29,879  casks,  against  39,398  at  the  close  of  1844.</span><span>  The  buyers  preferred  regularity  in  the  size  and</span><span>  weight  of  the  casks  ;  those  weighing  from  eight</span><span>  to  ten  cwt,  were  most  approved.  Uniformity  in</span><span>  the  colour  and  body  of  tallow  ensure  it  a  ready</span><span>  sale,  and  enables  it  to  compete  more  effectually</span><span>  with  Russian  tallow.  A  considerable  portion  of</span><span>  the  beef  tallow  shipped  had  been  too  highly  co-</span><span>  loured,  with  a  weak  and  greasy  body,  which  only</span><span>  fetched  40s.  ;  while  the  good  bright  or  pale  co-</span><span>  lour,  hard  and  pure,  sold  for  42s.  With  respect</span></p> <p><span>  to  hides  the  demand  had  kept  pace  with  the  supply</span><span>  ?????,  however,  a  great  defect  in  them,  in</span><span>  consequence  of  their  being  much  brand-marked,</span><span>  which  reduced  the  value  fully  ¼  to  ½  per  lb.</span><span>  Messrs.  Goad  and  Rigg  recommend  that  the</span><span>  hides  should  be  properly  flayed,  as  a  badly  cut</span><span>  hide  would  not  answer  for  Loshing,  for  which</span><span>  purpose  a  new  and  extensive  channel  of  con-</span><span>  sumption  was  opened  :  a  badly  cut  hide  could  not</span><span>  be  used  in  that  process.  The  estimated  gross</span><span>  value  of  the  hides  shipped  last  year  was  £52,650.</span><span>  The  expenses  on  salted  hides,  including  freight</span><span>  at  60s.  a  ton  and  all  other  charges,  amounts  to</span><span>  ½d.  per  lb.  ;  the  loss  of  weight  by  shrinking  on</span><span>  the  voyage  amounts  to  3/8d.  to  ½d.  per  lb.  making</span><span>  the  whole  cost  about  1d.  per  lb.  If  the  quality,</span><span>  condition,  and  flaying  go  on  improving,  it  is</span><span>  considered  that  they  will  approximate  more  closely</span><span>  in  value  to  the  River  Plate  hides  ;  and  even  should</span><span>  the  market  be  in  a  depressed  state,  they  were  not</span><span>  likely  to  fetch  less  than  3d.  per  lb.  A  few  samples</span><span>  of  horse  and  also  of  ox  and  cow  hair  have  been</span><span>  shipped  from  Sydney,  and  it  is  stated  that  any</span><span>  quantity  that  could  be  sent  would  meet  with  ready</span><span>  sale.  Horse-tail  hair,  of  eighten  to  twenty-four</span><span>  inches  long  and  upwards,  is  worth  from  1s.  4d.</span><span>  to  2s.  per  lb.  ;  it  is  valued  in  proportion  to  its</span><span>  length  and  strength  ;  mixed  tails  and  manes  are</span><span>  worth  9d.  to  1s.  per  lb.  ;  ox  and  cow  tuft  hair</span><span>  ranges  from  7d.  up  to  10d.  per  lb.  Horns  from</span><span>  Sydney  had  realized  high  prices  compared  with</span><span>  other  sorts  ;  those  weighing  from  18  to  22  oz.</span><span>  each,  if  fresh  and  clean,  brought  28s.  to  34s.  per</span><span>  123.  Hoofs,  if  whole,  clean,  and  sound,  brought</span><span>  from  £10  to  £12.  per  ton.  Except  shank  bones,</span><span>  which  realize  from  £7  to  £10  per  ton,  bones  and</span><span>  horns  cannot  be  expected  to  enter  into  our  list  of</span><span>  articles  of  export,  until  the  trade  between  Moreton</span><span>  Bay  and  England  becomes  direct.</span></p> <p><span>  IMPRISONMENT  FOR  DEBT.—Owing  to  a  sad</span><span>  oversight  in  the  Act,  passed  by  the  Legislative</span><span>  Council,  for  abolishing  imprisonment  for  debt,</span></p> <p><span>  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  of  Requests  was  not</span><span>  included  in  its  operation.  This  has  been  pro-</span><span>  ductive  of  lamentable  absurdities.  The  poor  man</span><span>  unable  to  pay  twenty  shillings  has  his  liberty  en-</span><span>  dangered  ;  his  neighbour  of  more  extensive  deal-</span><span>  ings  and  larger  debts,  has  had  the  full  benefit  of</span><span>  the  relaxation  of  the  law.  Advantage,  however,</span><span>  of  this  omission,  has,  we  believe,  been  taken  only</span><span>  in  the  Middle  District.  In  both  the  Southern</span><span>  and  Northern  Districts  of  the  colony,  the  law  has</span><span>  been  interpreted  rather  from  its  evident  intent,</span><span>  than  its  negligent  wording.  Whether  this  arises</span><span>  from  high  moral  principle  or  want  of  legal  know-</span><span>  ledge  it  is  not  for  us  to  decide  ;  we  are  of  course</span><span>  bound  to  suppose  the  former.  Mr.  Lowe  has  in-</span><span>  troduced  a  Bill  into  the  Council,  during  its  present</span><span>  session,  for  simplifying  and  amending  the  Act.</span><span>  This  Bill  repeals  the  28th  and  subsequent  sections</span><span>  of  the  7th  Victoria,  No.  19,—""  An  Act  for  the</span><span>  relief  of  insolvent  persons,  and  abolishing  im-</span><span>  prisonment  for  debt  ;""—those  sections  abolishing</span><span>  imprisonment  for  debt  except  in  certain  cases  ;</span></p> <p><span>  and  also  repeals  the  3rd  and  4th  sections  of</span><span>  the  8th  Victoria,  No.  15,  to  the  same  effect.  It</span><span>  then  provides—1st,  that  no  person  shall  be  ar-</span><span>  rested  on  mesne  or  final  process  issuing  out  of</span><span>  any  Court  of  Requests  ;  and  2nd,  that  no  person</span><span>  shall  be  arrested  on  any  writ  of  capias  ad  satis-</span><span>  faciendum  issuing  out  of  the  Supreme  Court,</span><span>  except  in  cases  of  fraudulent  concealment,  or  of</span></p> <p><span>  intention  to  leave  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  SOUTH  AUSTRALIAN  GRAIN.  —  Advices  have</span><span>  been  received  of  the  sale  in  London  of  a  quantity</span><span>  of  South  Australian  wheat,  of  the  Chidham  and</span><span>  Talavera  varieties,  at  prices  averaging  11s.  6d.</span><span>  to  12s.  per  bushel.  The  samples  exhibited  at  the</span><span>  Corn  Exchange  excited  much  interest,  they  were</span><span>  considered  of  fine  quality,  and  splendid  specimens</span><span>  of  the  capabilities  of  the  colony.  A  sample  of</span><span>  barley  from  the  same  colony  also  attracted  much</span><span>  attention,  and  was  pronounced  to  be  equal  to  any</span><span>  that  had  ever  been  seen  in  the  London  market.</span></p> <p><span>  IMPORTANT  —  PARTIAL  REVIVAL  OF  IMMI-</span><span>  GRATION.—On  looking  over  a  file  of  Cork  papers,</span><span>  we  find  there  is  every  likelihood  of  a  renewel  of</span><span>  immigration,  at  least  on  a  limited  scale.  It  ap-</span><span>  peared  to  several  members  of  the  Cork  Poor  Law</span><span>  Guardians,  that  as  there  were  numbers  of  stout</span><span>  and  able  females  thronging  the  County  and  City</span><span>  Poor  Houses,  doing  nothing,  and  a  continuous</span><span>  tax  upon  the  poor-rate  revenues,  that  their  trans-</span><span>  portation  to  some  place  where  their  labours  would</span><span>  not  only  be  required,  but  well  rewarded,  would  be</span><span>  a  matter  of  vast  importance  to  Ireland  as  well  as</span><span>  the  Colonies  ;  the  subject  so  far  engrossed  their</span><span>  attention,  as  to  have  its  feasibility  discussed  at</span><span>  several  board  meetings,  and  even  a  communica-</span><span>  tion  opened  with  Mr.  J.  Besnard,  jun.,  the  cele-</span><span>  brated  emigration  agent,  relative  to  a  pauper  im-</span><span>  migration  to  Australia.

Mr.  Klose,  with  an  assault  upon  a</span><span>  native  girl  named  Nigarparla,  whose  father,  an</span><span>  aged  black,  was  present;  the  wife  of  the  accused</span><span>  was  there  also  ;  she  is  the  girl  who  so  long  lived</span><span>  with  Governors  Gawler  and  Grey,  but  who  eloped</span><span>  with  Jemmy,  since  Government-house  became  a</span><span>  bachelors  hall  ;  she  was  in  native  costume—</span><span>  having  no  other  clothing  than  a  kangaroo  skin  ;</span><span>  and  so  far  from  blaming  her  husband  for  his  in-</span><span>  fidelity,  walked  off  with  him  in  triumph,  when  the</span><span>  case  was  adjourned  till  the  next  day,  on  account</span><span>  of  the  non-appearance  of  the  (so-called)  prose-</span><span>  cutrix.  This  girl  presents  a  curious  illustration</span><span>  of  the  training  of  the  natives.

"<p><span>  LOCAL  INTELLIGENCE.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  CONSTABULARY.</span></p> <p><span>  ABOUT  a  fortnight  since,  Mr.  Constable  McCro-</span><span>  hon,  on  account  of  his  previous  good  conduct</span><span>  was  promoted  to  the  rank  of  District  Constable,</span><span>  and  was  ordered  to  proceed  to  Ipswich  in  the  room</span><span>  of  Mr.  Higgins,  who  was  dismissed  for  gross</span><span>  misconduct.  Our  Ipswich  friends,  doubtless,  were</span><span>  congratulating  themselves  that  the  new  official</span><span>  would  be  of  a  different  stamp  to  his  predecessor—</span><span>  that  McCrohon,  who  had  for  two  long  years</span><span>  been  a  staunch  teetotaller,  would  not  again  be</span><span>  found  guilty  of  the  besetting  sin.  Their  expec-</span><span>  tations,  however,  were  doomed  to  be  disappointed.</span><span>  Mr.  McCrohon,  as  a  plain  Dogberry,  was  well</span><span>  enough  in  his  way  ;  but  the  moment  the  covetted</span></p> <p><span>  title  of  District  Constable  was  conferred,  he  was</span><span>  quite  another  man.  Unlooked-for  titles,  like  un-</span><span>  looked  riches,  have  turned  many  a  man's  head,</span><span>  and  so  it  was  with  McCrohon.  On  his  arrival  at</span><span>  the  quiet  town  of  Ipswich,  Mr.  McCrohon  was  the</span><span>  ""  observed  of  all  observers  ;""  the  inhabitants</span><span>  flocked  to  the  wharf  to  catch  a  glimpse  of  the</span><span>  great  D.C.  then,  for  the  first  time,  come  amongst</span><span>  them  to  assume  the  onerous  duties  of  his  dreaded</span><span>  office.  Even  the  little  urchins  about  the  town</span><span>  participated  in  the  excitement,  and  sung  out  most</span><span>  lustily  for  an  extra  supply  of  lollys.  Mr.  McCro-</span><span>  hon  suddenly  found  himself  an  important  per-</span><span>  sonage-a  rising  man.  He  was  placed  there  to</span><span>  do  something,  and  something  he  thought  must</span><span>  be  done,  and  that  promptly.  Elevated  as  he  now</span><span>  was,  in  more  senses  than  one—thoroughly  con-</span><span>  scious  of  his  own  power  and  dignity-one  of  his</span><span>  first  official  acts  was  to  turn  one  of  his  subordi-</span><span>  nates  out  of  his  quarters  :—""  Arise,  arise,""  said</span><span>  he  to  his  trembling  Sub,  ""  go  to  thy  father,  and</span><span>  say,  I,  I,  District  Constable  McCrohon,  desired</span><span>  thee  to  vanish  !""  Poor  Magrath  looked,  implor-</span><span>  ingly  at  his  superior,  but  the  mandate  had  gone</span><span>  forth,  and  budge  he  must.  Having  thus  im-</span><span>  pressed  his  ""  Sub""  with  an  idea  of  the  vast  extent</span><span>  of  his  power,  the  great  D.  C.,  cane  in  hand,  and</span><span>  as  erect  as  ""  a  yard  of  pump  water,""  took  a  stroll</span><span>  round  the  town  ;  the  ""  Sub""  following  at  a  re-</span><span>  spectful  distance.  Of  course,  the  taverns  claimed</span><span>  his  first  attention,  and  excited  his  surprise,  which</span><span>  feeling  ripened  into  admiration,  after  he  had  paid</span><span>  his  respects  to  the  inmates,  and  had  partaken  of</span><span>  their  hospitality.  Mr.  McCrohon  was  received</span><span>  kindly-was  treated  handsomely,  and  had  he  acted</span><span>  wisely  might  have  lived  there  happy  and  respected</span><span>  in  his  station  of  life,  but  an  overweening  conceit</span><span>  of  his  newly-created  dignity,  marred  all  his  pros-</span><span>  pects.  Having  enjoyed  himself  to  his  heart's</span><span>  content,  he  was  going  home  to  his  lodgings  ;  a</span><span>  facetious  idea  struck  him,  and  he  proceeded  forth-</span><span>  with  to  carry  it  out.  He  thought  that  it  would</span><span>  be  a  capital  joke  to  call  at  the  Doctor's  house,  and</span><span>  ask  him  to  ""  shout.""  On  rapping  at  the  door,  he</span><span>  was  admitted,  and  the  following  colloquy  took</span><span>  place  :</span></p> <p><span>  McCrohon—I  say,'Doctor  (hiccup),  have  you</span><span>  got  any  g-g-gin  (hiccup)  ?</span></p> <p><span>  Doctor—What  sort  of  gin?</span></p> <p><span>  McCrohon—Why,  any  (hiccup)  s-s-sort  of  gin</span><span>  (the  last  word  was  whispered).</span></p> <p><span>  Doctor—(Good  humouredly)  I  have  got  oxy-</span><span>  gin,  hydro-gin,  and  nitro-gin,  which  of  the  three</span><span>  will  you  have?</span></p> <p><span>  McCrohon—Why,  any  sort  of  gin,  as  I  said</span><span>  bef—  (the  last  syllable  was  inaudible),  Any  sort</span><span>  of  gin,  Sir.  Mix  'em,  mix—a  little  hot  water,</span><span>  and  su-su-(hore  the  worthy  D.  C.  again  sung</span><span>  small,  and  gave  a  knowing  wink).</span></p> <p><span>  The  Doctor,  however,  cut  short  the  conversation,</span><span>  by  peremptorily  ordering  the  D.  C.  to  leave  the</span><span>  house,  which  the  official,  to  his  credit  be  it  spoken,</span><span>  immediately  did,  and  retired  to  his  lodgings,  where,</span><span>  doubtless,  he  afterwards  found  that  the  evening's</span><span>  amusement  would  not  bear  the  morning's  reflec-</span><span>  tion.  The  particulars  of  his  unhappy  debut  in</span><span>  Ipswich,  having  become  known  to  the  Magistrates,</span><span>  he  was  immediately  summoned  before  the  Brisbane</span><span>  Bench  and  called  upon  to  account  for  his  eccentric</span><span>  behaviour.  On  Tuesday,  Mr.  McCrohon  accord-</span><span>  ingly  appeared,  and  in  his  defence  stated  that  the</span><span>  Magistrates  were  misinformed  respecting  his</span><span>  doings  at  Ipswich.  ""  Sir,""  said  McCrohon,  ad-</span></p> <p><span>  dressing  himself  to  the  Police  Magistrate,  ""  I  met</span><span>  with  hostile  feelings  on  the  part  of  the  inhabitants</span><span>  the  very  moment  I  put  my  foot  on  their  shores  ;</span><span>  I  Sir,  have  been  made  the  victim  of  a  faction  ;  I</span><span>  Sir,""—here  however  he  was  suddenly  brought  up,</span><span>  by  the  Police  Magistrate,  who  stopped  his  orato-</span><span>  rical  display,  by  informing  him,  that  his  turning</span><span>  out  Magrath  was  an  act  of  impertinence  beyond</span><span>  the  scope  of  his  authority,  and  that  he  knew  quite</span><span>  enough  to  convince  him,  that  he  (McCrohon)  was</span><span>  not  a  proper  person  to  hold  the  office  of  District</span><span>  Constable  ;  he  should,  therefore,  reduce  him  to</span></p> <p><span>  his  former  situation,  and  if  he  did  not  conduct</span><span>  himself  properly  for  the  future,  he  would  be  dis-</span><span>  missed  from  the  force  without  ceremony.

The  bust  of</span><span>  this  celebrated  explorer,  executed  by  Mr.  Abraham,</span><span>  was  placed  in  Mr.  Lyons'  Long  Room,  and  the</span><span>  likeness  is  pronounced  to  be  excellent.

The  natives  have</span><span>  taken  advantage  of  the  pacific  dispositions  of  the</span><span>  Germans,  to  fleece  them  on  several  occasions,  and</span><span>  the  probability  is,  they  will  renew  their  outrages</span><span>  the  first  favourable  opportunity,  ""knowing  well,  as</span><span>  they  do,  that  they  are  sure  to  come  off  scatheless.</span></p> <p><span>  A  HARD  CASE.—At  the  Police  Office,  on  Tues-</span><span>  day,  Mr.  McCabe,  of  South  Brisbane,  appeared</span><span>  before  the  Bench,  to  answer  an  information  laid</span><span>  against  him  by  the  Chief  Constable,  for  suffering</span><span>  drunken  men  to  remain  on  his  premises  on  the</span><span>  morning  of  Sunday  last.  The  defendant  stated</span><span>  that  the  men  entered  his  house  by  the  back  door,</span><span>  all  the  other  doors  being  fastened,  and  that  he  was</span><span>  endeavouring  to  get  them  out,  after  having  refused</span><span>  to  serve  them  with  liquors,  when  Constable  Ram-</span><span>  say  came  in.  Ramsay  admitted  that  he  did  not</span><span>  see  any  drinking  going  on,  nor  any  preparations</span><span>  for  serving  the  parties  who  were  inside.  The</span><span>  Bench  mulcted  McCabe  in  the  sum  of  40s.  and</span><span>  costs,  being  the  lowest  penalty.</span></p> <p><span>  NARROW  ESCAPE.—On  Tuesday  last,  an  acci-</span><span>  dent  happened  to  Mrs.  Geag,  wife  of  Mr.  Geag,</span><span>  the  market-gardener,  residing  at  Breakfast  Creek,</span><span>  which  might  have  been  attended  with  serious  con-</span><span>  sequences.  Mrs.  Geag  was  proceeding  home  with</span><span>  her  horse  and  cart,  and  having  arrived  at  the</span><span>  Creek,  took  the  horse  out  of  the  cart,  as  was  her</span><span>  usual  custom,  with  the  intention  of  leading  him</span><span>  across-the  dilapidated  state  of  the  bridge  render-</span><span>  ing  it  unsafe  to  take  any  vehicle  over.  She  was</span><span>  going  quietly  over  it,  when  one  of  the  planks  gave</span><span>  way,  and  the  horse  losing  his  footing,  was  preci-</span><span>  pitated  into  the  water,  together  with  Mrs,  Geag,</span><span>  who  preserved  sufficient  presence  of  mind  not  to</span><span>  let  go  the  reins,  and  to  hold  on  by  the  mane.  On</span><span>  reaching  the  side,  the  horse  was  startled  by  a  boy,</span><span>  who  had  run  down  to  render  assistance,  and  again</span><span>  plunged  into  the  stream,  Mrs.  Geag  still  holding</span></p> <p><span>  on  by  the  reins  and  mane.  After  swimming</span><span>  about  a  short  time,  the  horse  came  to  the  bank,</span><span>  and  Mr.  Geag  having  come  to  his  wife's  aid,  she</span><span>  was  extricated  from  her  perilous  situation,  with</span><span>  only  a  slight  bruise  on  the  knee  from  the  horse's</span><span>  feet.  The  horse  subsequently  managed,  by  a</span><span>  violent  effort,  to  get  out  of  the  creek  uninjured.</span><span>  The  bridge  is  now  quite  impassable,  and  something</span><span>  ought  to  be  done  immediately  by  the  Government</span><span>  either  to  put  it  in  repair,  or  to  erect  a  new  one.</span><span>  Heretofore,  not  one  sixpence  has  been  expended  in</span><span>  the  formation  of  roads  and  bridges  in  the  district  ;</span><span>  whatever  has  been  effected  has  been  done  by</span><span>  private  enterprise,  and  it  is  high  time  some  stir</span><span>  should  be  made  in  this  matter  by  the  residents.</span><span>  They  must  agitate,  or  they  will  not  obtain  what</span><span>  they  are  equitably  entitled  to  --  a  fair  proportion</span><span>  of  the  amount  voted  by  the  Legislative  Council  for</span><span>  the  repairs  of  roads  and  bridges  throughout  the</span></p> <p><span>  various  districts.</span></p> <p><span>  BREACHES  OF  THE  SLAUGHTERING  ACT.—On</span><span>  the  22nd  instant,  at  the  Police  Office,  Mr.  Martin</span><span>  Byrne,  of  Ipswich,  was  fined  £5  and  costs;  for  a</span><span>  breach  of  the  Licensed  Slaughtering  Act.  On</span><span>  Tuesday,  the  information  against  William  Stuart,</span><span>  of  Kangaroo  Point,  reported  in  our  last  number,</span><span>  for  a  similar  infringement  of  the  Act,  was  dis-</span><span>  missed,  and  a  new  summons  granted.</span></p> <p><span>  BREACHES  OF  THE  HIRED  SERVANTS'  ACT—At</span><span>  the  Police  Office,  on  Tuesday,  a  bullock-driver,</span><span>  named  John  McDonald,  in  the  employ  of  Mr.</span><span>  Whitting  of  Darling  Downs,  was  brought  before</span><span>  the  Magistrates,  charged  with  neglect  of  duty  and</span><span>  drunkenness  on  the  27th  ult.  The  case  being</span><span>  fully  proved,  the  Bench  sentenced  him  to  six</span><span>  weeks'  imprisonment  in  Sydney  Gaol.—On  the</span><span>  same  day,  Thomas  Harvey,  waiter,  at  the  Victoria</span><span>  Hotel,  in  North  Brisbane,  was  summoned  to</span><span>  answer  the  complaint  of  Mr.  Bow,  for  having</span><span>  absconded  from  his  hired  service,  and  for  insolent</span><span>  conduct.  The  Magisirates  having  heard  the</span><span>  evidence,  adjudged  the  defendant  to  forfeit  all</span><span>  wages  due  to  him,  and  his  agreement  to  be  can-</span></p> <p><span>  celled.</span></p> <p><span>  ASSAULT.—On  the  29th  ult.,  a  person  named</span><span>  George  Croft,  appeared  before  the  Bench  on  a</span><span>  charge  of  assault,  and  for  using  threatening</span><span>  language  to  Constable  Magrath,  at  Ipswich,  on</span><span>  Wednesday  the  23rd  ult.  The  evidence  of  the</span><span>  constable  having  been  taken,  the  Magistrates</span><span>  bound  Croft  over  to  keep  the  peace,  himself  in  £50,</span><span>  and  two  sureties  in  £25  each.  The  case,  as  far</span><span>  as  regards  the  assault  was,  at  the  request  of  the</span><span>  defendant,  postponed  until  Tuesday  next,  to  allow</span><span>  him  to  bring  forward  his  witnesses  to  rebut  the</span><span>  charge.</span></p> <p><span>  DIFFERENTIAL  DUTIES.—This  Act,  which</span><span>  passed  the  Legislative  Council  13th  July,  1846,</span><span>  does  not  come  into  operation  until  the  1st  April,</span><span>  1847  ;  but  it  is  now  understood  that  it  will  not</span><span>  affect  the  importation  of  cattle  and  sheep  from</span><span>  Port  Phillip,  or  any  other  part  of  New  South</span></p> <p><span>  Wales.—Hobart  Town  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  AUSTRALIAN  HORSES.—We  have  learnt  with</span><span>  considerable  pleasure  that  several  of  our  crack</span><span>  horses  exported  hence  to  Calcutta,  have  found</span><span>  their  way  to  Ceylon,  where  their  fleetness  and</span><span>  bottom  on  the  race-course  have  proved  that  the</span><span>  horse-flesh  of  this  colony  stands  superior  to  the</span><span>  pure  Arab.

Mr.  Smythe,</span><span>  with  his  armed  detachment  of  the  Barrabool  tribe</span><span>  (which  he  employed  with  the  sanction  of  the  Go-</span><span>  vernment,  to  assist  him  in  apprehending  an  abo-</span><span>  riginal  charged  with  murder),  first  came  upon</span><span>  the  traces  of  the  Cape  Otway  tribe  near  Mr.</span><span>  Roadknight's  station  at  the  Cape.  With  the  ex-</span><span>  pectation  of  finding  the  object  of  their  search</span><span>  encamped  at  the  huts,  Mr.  Smythe's  party  sur-</span><span>  rounded  and  made  a  sudden  descent  upon  the</span><span>  station  ;  but  he  had  gone  away  some  time  pre-</span><span>  viously.  The  Barrabool  blacks  soon  fell  upon  his</span><span>  trail,  and  followed  it  up  with  unerring  sagacity,</span><span>  until  they  reached  the  Eyre  River.  Here  there</span><span>  was  an  open  space  of  about  three  quarters  of  a</span><span>  mile,  and  the  advanced  party  caught  sight  of  the</span><span>  Cape  Otway  tribe,  quambying  on  the  opposite</span><span>  side  of  the  river.  As  it  was  impossible  to  effect</span><span>  an  immediate  crossing  at  this  place,  without  giving</span><span>  an  alarm,  the  whole  party  struck  off  towards  the</span><span>  beach,  keeping  under  cover  of  the  wood,  until</span><span>  they  reached  the  bar  across  the  mouth  of  the</span><span>  river,  where  they  crossed,  wading  through  the</span><span>  the  surf.  From  thence  they  passed  inland  until</span><span>  the  Cape  Otway  tribe  were  between  them  and  the</span></p> <p><span>  river,  when  they  made  preparations  for  a  descent</span><span>  upon  their  prey.  Mr.  Smythe's  instructions  were</span><span>  to  capture  the  only  surviving  male  of  the  tribe,</span><span>  and  to  spare  the  women  and  children.  But  to</span><span>  expect  subordination  from  savages  on  the  scent</span><span>  of  blood,  was  vain.  The  blacks  led  the  way  in</span></p> <p><span>  advance,  crawling  through  the  scrub  as  noise-</span><span>  lessly  as  snakes,  until  they  reached  the  top  of  a</span><span>  rise,  from  whence  could  be  seen  the  mia-mias  of</span><span>  the  tribe  below.  All  was  still.  There  was  no  one</span><span>  on  the  look  out.  One  moment  of  preparation</span><span>  elapsed,  and  the  Barrabool  tribe  rushed  down  the</span><span>  hill  with  such  precipitancy,  that  the  Cape  Otway</span><span>  blacks  had  scarcely  time  to  start  to  their  feet  ere</span><span>  the  assailants'  weapons  were  at  work  among  them.</span><span>  The  solitary  chief  of  the  devoted  tribe  fell  almost</span><span>  immediately,  with  seven  or  eight  balls  through</span><span>  him.  The  strife  then  ceased  for  a  moment,  and</span><span>  the  women  and  children  might  have  been  saved,</span><span>  had  not  one  of  themselves,  a  young  girl,  pointed</span><span>  out  two  old  lubras  who  had  assisted  at  the  murders</span><span>  of  several  white  men,  and  blacks  of  other  tribes  ;</span><span>  this  roused  once  more  the  savage  thirst  of  blood</span><span>  in  their  assailants,  who,  throwing  away  their</span><span>  muskets,  and  flourishing  their  tomahawks,  finished</span><span>  their  murderous  work  by  the  destruction  of  all  the</span><span>  women  and  children  (seven  in  number,  we  believe)</span><span>  with  the  exception  of  the  girl  who  had  denounced</span><span>  the  others.  At  this  juncture,  Mr.  Smith  came</span><span>  up,  and  seizing  the  girl  by  the  hand,  saved  her</span><span>  from  the  fate  of  her  companions.  This  girl</span></p> <p><span>  speaks  the  language  of  the  Colac  tribe.  She</span><span>  states  that  the  man  who  was  killed,  had  murdered</span><span>  three  white  men.  She  has  been  brought  to  Gee-</span><span>  long;  and,  beyond  being  somewhat  frightened,</span></p> <p><span>  she  does  not  seem  to  be  much  affected  at  the  awful</span><span>  fate  of  her  relatives.  We  understand  that  it  is</span><span>  Mr.  Smythe's  intention  to  request  an  examination</span><span>  into  the  circumstances  attending  this  event  ;  and</span><span>  that  such  an  examination  will  take  place,  is  quite</span><span>  certain  ;  in  fact  it  will  be  imperatively  the  duty</span><span>  of  the  Government  to  institute  inquiry.

"<p><span>  THE  LEGISLATIVE  COUNCIL,</span></p> <p><span>  SEPTEMBER  8.</span></p> <p><span>  After  the  delivery  of  His  Excellency's  speech,</span><span>  which  we  published  in  our  last,  several  honorable</span><span>  members  spoke  on  the  adoption  of  a  reply.  Among</span><span>  others,  Mr.  WENTWORTH  expressed  his  deep  grati-</span><span>  fication  at  the  speech.  It  was,  he  said,  so  unlike</span><span>  anything,  in  the  shape  of  an  address  from  the</span><span>  Governor,  that  had  yet  been  heard  within  the  walls</span><span>  of  that  house,  that  he  was  sure  the  sentiments  it</span><span>  professed,  and  the  tone  it  breathed,  must  be  matter</span><span>  of  earnest  congratulation  to  them  all.  He  would</span><span>  not  allow  himself  to  believe  that  that  document</span><span>  could  be  the  mere  fume  and  froth  with  nothing  at</span><span>  the  bottom,  which  had  formed  the  materials  of</span><span>  similar  addresses  hitherto  delivered  to  that  house,</span><span>  He,  for  one,  had  no  doubt  from  the  caution  evinced</span><span>  by  His  Excellency  in  not  entering  hastily  into</span><span>  measures  of  importance—from  the  intention  ex-</span><span>  pressed  by  him  of  visiting  the  interior  and  in-</span><span>  forming  himself  of  subjects  of  which  he  at  present</span><span>  could  know  nothing,  that  His  Excellency  would</span><span>  endeavour  to  fulfil  the  professions  of  his  speech.</span><span>  It  was  by  such  a  course  alone  that  he  could  arrive</span><span>  at  any  knowledge  of  that  most  important  question,</span></p> <p><span>  with  regard  to  the  colony,  the  settlement  of  which</span><span>  was  pending,  the  Squatting  and  Crown  Lands</span><span>  question.</span></p> <p><span>  SEPTEMBER  9,</span></p> <p><span>  Two  letters  were  read  from  the  Hon.

The  Bill  was  nearly  the</span><span>  same  as  that  he  had  introduced  last  session.  Its</span><span>  main  principle  was  to  give  benches  of  magistrates</span><span>  jurisdiction  over  actions  for  debts  not  exceeding</span><span>  £10.  There  were  various  other  alterations  of  the</span><span>  existing  law,  such  as  bringing  actions  of  trespass,</span><span>  where  the  damages  did  not  exceed  £10,  under  the</span><span>  jurisdiction  of  these  Courts,  excluding  all  those</span><span>  cases  where  the  title  of  freehold  came  in  question.</span></p> <p><span>  Leave  granted,  and  the  Bill  read  a  first  time.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Council  resolved  to  address  His  Excellency,</span><span>  praying  him  to  move  Her  Majesty  to  disallow  an</span><span>  Act  of  the  Legislature  of  Van  Diemen's  Land,</span><span>  which  imposes  a  duty  of  fifteen  per  cent  on  the</span><span>  produce  of  New  South  Wales  imported  into  that</span><span>  colony.  In  the  course  of  the  debate  that  took</span><span>  place  before  the  address  was  resolved  upon,  the</span><span>  Colonial  Secretary,  cleverly  adapting  his  ideas  to</span></p> <p><span>  ""  things  as  they  are,  and  not  as  they  have  been,""</span><span>  or  to  use  a  homely  adage,  ""  cutting  his  coat  ac-</span><span>  cording  to  his  cloth,""  made  a  furious  free-trade</span><span>  speech.

The  provisions  referred</span><span>  to  having  been  found  to  interfere  with  the  facili-</span><span>  ties  of  trade,  it  had  been  found  necessary  to  re-</span><span>  peal  those  portions  of  them  relating  to  goods</span><span>  shipped  in  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  ROBINSON  called  the  attention  of  the  Col-</span><span>  lector  of  Customs  to  the  report  of  the  Committee</span><span>  on  Wharfage  Rates,  in  which  it  was  recommended</span><span>  that  whenever  the  revenue  would  permit,  the  rates</span><span>  should  be  abolished.  It  was  a  very  petty  tax,  the</span><span>  amount  raised  last  year  in  Sydney  being  only</span><span>  £3200,  and  in  Melbourne  only  £1200  ;  and  as  it</span><span>  has  a  considerable  effect  upon  trade,  it  was  worthy</span><span>  of  consideration  whether  the  wharfage  rate  should</span><span>  not  be  abolished  altogether  now  that  the  revenue</span><span>  is  in  a  flourishing  condition.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Bill  was  read  a  first  time.</span></p> <p><span>  So  also  was  a  Bill  to  remove  difficulties  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  disposal,  administration,  and  distribution  of  In-</span><span>  solvent  Estates,  which  had  become  necessary  in</span><span>  consequence  of  doubts  on  the  part  of  some  of  the</span><span>  legal  fraternity  as  to  the  effect  of  titles  derived</span></p> <p><span>  under  insolvent  estates.</span></p> <p><span>  SEPTEMBER  11.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  BREWSTER  moved  for  leave  to  bring  in  a</span><span>  Bill  to  declare  and  amend  the  law  respecting  the</span><span>  date  of  Deeds  of  Grant  of  Crown  Lands.  The</span><span>  object  of  the  Bill  was  to  declare  that  a  grant</span><span>  should  bear  date,  not  from  the  day  on  which  it</span><span>  was  signed  by  the  Governor,  as  at  present,  but</span></p> <p><span>  from  the  time  when  the  land  it  conveyed  had  been</span><span>  bought  and  paid  for.</span></p> <p><span>  Bill  read  a  first  time.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  MURRAY  moved  for  leave  to  bring  in  a  Bill</span><span>  to  amend  the  Masters  and  Servants'  Act.  By  a</span><span>  decision  which  had  been  lately  given  by  the  Syd-</span><span>  ney  magistrates,  it  would  appear  that  men  who</span><span>  signed  indentures  of  service  in  Van  Diemen's</span><span>  Land  with  masters  in  the  colony,  were  not  con-</span><span>  sidered  to  come  under  that  Act.  Mr.  Eales,  of</span><span>  the  Hunter  River,  had  brought  a  case  of  this</span><span>  description  before  the  Bench,  and  they  had  de-</span><span>  cided  that  they  had  no  jurisdiction.  There  were</span><span>  other  clauses  too,  which  would  appear  to  be  de-</span><span>  fective  in  reference  to  this  point,  even  if  the  in-</span><span>  dentures  could  be  brought  under  the  jurisdiction</span><span>  of  the  Act.  Summary  jurisdiction  was  only  given</span><span>  in  cases  in  which  the  parties  appeared  before  the</span><span>  Bench  for  some  breach  of  their  contract,  in  their</span><span>  several  capacity  as  masters  and  servants,  and  he</span><span>  doubted  Whether  a  breach  of  these  indentures  could</span><span>  be  brought  under  these  clauses.  Another  defect</span><span>  in  the  law  which  required  amendment  was,  that  it</span><span>  provided  no  punishments  for  forged  certificates,</span><span>  and  as  these  forgeries  were  growing  very  common,</span><span>  it  was  absolutely  necessary,  if  the  Act  were  to  be</span><span>  carried  out  at  all,  that  some  punishment  should</span><span>  be  provided.  Another  fault  in  the  Act  was  that  it</span><span>  gave  the  servant  a  right  to  appeal  to  a  Court  of</span><span>  Quarter  Session,  in  cases  of  an  award  made  by</span><span>  the  magistrates,  whilst  the  master  was  denied  all</span><span>  right  to  appeal,  except  in  case  of  a  conviction.</span><span>  In  the  penalties  imposed,  as  far  as  his  experience</span><span>  went,  he  had  found  the  Act  to  work  well.  He</span><span>  would  notice  two  great  objections  urged  against</span><span>  the  Act  by  different  parties.  The  first  was,  that</span><span>  it  gave  the  magistrates  the  power  to  examine  both</span><span>  the  complainant  and  defendant  on  oath,  and  that</span><span>  this  was  productive  of  very  serious  evils.  He,</span><span>  however,  did  not  see  that  there  was  anything  in</span><span>  this  that  was  not  quite  consistent  with  the  spirit</span><span>  of  the  law  reforms  which  were  taking  place  at</span><span>  home,  and  they  had  two  precedents  for  it  in  the</span><span>  law  as  it  at  present  existed  in  the  colony,  for  both</span><span>  parties  could  be  examined  on  oath  in  the  Courts</span></p> <p><span>  of  Requests,  and  under  the  Merchant  Seamen's</span><span>  Act,  and,  under  certain  limitations,  in  some  actions</span></p> <p><span>  brought  in  the  Supreme  Court.  The  other  ob-</span><span>  jection  entertained  against  the  Act  was,  the  sys-</span><span>  tem  of  giving  discharges,  but  for  this  also  they</span><span>  had  a  precedent  in  the  Merchant  Seamen's  Act,</span><span>  the  provisions  of  which  were  in  their  spirit  and  in-</span><span>  tentions  analogous  to  the  Act  under  consideration.</span><span>  Mr.  DANGAR  said,  when  the  Bill  went  in  Com</span><span>  mittee  he  should  move  several  alterations.  The</span><span>  first  would  be  to  make  the  penalty  for  masters  en-</span><span>  gaging  servants  who  had  not  a  discharge,  much</span></p> <p><span>  higher  than  it  was  at  present.  Under  the  Act  it</span><span>  was  limited  to  £5,  which  was  insufficient.  The</span><span>  next  defect  he  should  propose  to  amend  was  that</span><span>  clause  of  the  Act  rendering  it  necessary  for  ser-</span><span>  vants  to  obtain  a  discharge,  making  an  exception</span><span>  in  favour  of  natives  and  free  emigrants  who  had</span><span>  not  been  before  engaged.  The  effect  of  this  was</span><span>  to  nullify  the  operation  of  the.  Act,  for  of  course</span><span>  any  runaway  servant,  who  applied  for  service,</span><span>  would,  when  he  was  asked  for  his  discharge,  say</span><span>  that  he  was  a  native,  or  that  it  was  the  first  time</span><span>  of  his  engaging.  He  should  propose  that  all</span><span>  persons  in  whose  favour  the  exception  in  the  Act</span><span>  was  made  should  provide  themselves  with  a  cer-</span><span>  tificate  from  a  single  magistrate,  stating  who  they</span><span>  were.  He  did  not  require  a  certificate  from  a</span><span>  bench  of  magistrates,  but  from  a  single  magis-</span><span>  trate,  and  there  would  never  be  any  difficulty  in</span><span>  obtaining  this.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  ROBINSON  was  of  opinion  that  the  main</span><span>  reason  that  the  Act  had  not  answered  expectations</span><span>  was,  because  there  were  no  Courts  of  Petty  Ses-</span><span>  sions  established  beyond  the  boundaries  of  location,</span><span>  to  enforce  its  operation.</span></p> <p><span>  Leave  was  then  granted,  and  the  Bill  read  a</span></p> <p><span>  first  time.</span></p> <p><span>  Captain  O'CONNELL  moved  for  a  return  of  all</span><span>  the  horses,  cattle,  and  sheep,  sold  by  auction  in</span><span>  the  colony  of  New  South  Wales,  and  upon  which</span><span>  duty  has  been  paid  from  the  year  1836  to  1845,</span><span>  both  years  inclusive,  specifying  the  total  amount,</span><span>  the  average  price  paid,  and  the  highest  and  lowest</span><span>  price  per  head  paid  in  each  year  respectively.  His</span><span>  object  in  this  motion  was  to  add  a  very  important</span><span>  item  to  that  valuable  mass  of  statistical  informa-</span><span>  tion,  which  the  talent  and  industry  of  the  Colonial</span><span>  Secretary,  from  year  to  year,  brought  before  them.</span><span>  He  thought  he  might  assume  that  the  capital  of</span><span>  the  colony  was  principally  vested  in  live  stock,</span><span>  and  any  fluctuations  in  the  price  of  such  stock</span><span>  would  be  a  pretty  fair  index  of  the  prosperity  or</span><span>  depression  of  the  colony.  He  found  there  were</span><span>  returns  of  sales  by  auction  from  which  this  in-</span><span>  formation  could  probably  be  compiled.</span></p> <p><span>  Question  put,  and  passed.</span></p> <p><span>  Council  adjourned  to  the  15th.</span></p> <p><span>  SEPTEMBER  15.</span></p> <p><span>  The  SPEAKER  stated  that  the  deputation  ap-</span><span>  pointed  by  the  House  to  present  the  address  of</span><span>  the  Legislative  Council,  praying  His  Excellency</span><span>  to  move  Her  Majesty  to  disallow  the  Bill  lately</span><span>  passed  by  the  Legislature  of  Van  Diemen's  Land,</span><span>  proposing  an  ad  valorem  duty  of  fifteen  per  cent.</span><span>  on  the  produce  of  New  South  Wales  imported  into</span><span>  that  colony,  had  waited  upon  His  Excellency,  who</span><span>  had  been  pleased  to  inform  them  that  he  would</span><span>  forward  the  address  to  the  Secretary  of  State,  and</span></p> <p><span>  would  use  his  own  influence  with  the  Government</span></p> <p><span>  in  support  of  the  prayer  of  the  address.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  BREWSTER  moved  for  leave  to  bring  in  a</span><span>  Bill  to  regulate  the  practice  of  the  legal  profes-</span><span>  sion,  as  relating  to  the  admission  of  barristers</span><span>  and  attorneys  ;  and  to  render  both  branches  of</span><span>  the  profession  common  to  both,  as  was  the  case  in</span><span>  this  colony  up  to  February,  1835,  when  the  bar</span><span>  was  for'  the  first  time  divided.  There  was  no  di-</span><span>  vision  of  barristers  and  attorneys  (Mr.  B.  said)</span><span>  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  the  West  Indies,</span><span>  Van  Diemen's  Land,  and  South  Australia.  The</span><span>  hon.  member  produced  several  bills  of  costs,  which</span><span>  he  read  to  the  House  ;  asserting  that  had  the  pro-</span><span>  fession  been  open,  the  same  services  would  have  been</span></p> <p><span>  rendered  to  tho  client  for  one-fourth  of  the  amount.</span></p> <p><span>  Quoted  from  Jeremy  Bentham,  &c,  &c.</span></p> <p><span>  Motion  seconded  by  Mr.  DANGAR.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  WENTWORTH  moved  the  previous  question,</span><span>  which  was  seconded  by  Mr.  DARVALL.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  LOWE  made  a  very  able  speech  in  support</span><span>  of  the  original  motion  ;  in  the  course  of  which</span><span>  he  characterised  the  division  of  the  bar  as  a</span><span>  ""most  absurd  and  useless  monopoly  -  it  gave</span><span>  neither  talent  nor  respectability  to  the  profession</span><span>  of  a  barrister,  whilst  it  shut  out  those  who  had</span><span>  both.  It  increased  the  expense  attendant  upon</span><span>  the  administration  of  justice  ;  and  to  him  it  ap-</span><span>  peared  that  of  all  taxes  the  most  cruel  was  the  tax</span><span>  upon  justice  ;  for  it  was  a  tax  upon  right.  It</span><span>  was  a  tax  upon  the  poor  and  weak  man,  to  prevent</span><span>  him  asserting  his  right  against  the  oppression</span><span>  and  wrong-doings  of  the  rich  and  powerful.  But</span><span>  if  a  tax  on  justice  wore  bad  in  any  shape,  how</span><span>  much  worse  was  it,  when  it  was  levied  not  to  go</span><span>  into  the  public  revenue-not  to  promote  the  public</span><span>  good,  but  secure  the  monopoly  of  certain  emolu-</span><span>  ments  to  any  particular  class  of  men.  For  what,</span><span>  he  would  ask,  were  barristers,  but  a  tax  on  the</span><span>  administration  of  justice?  There  could  be  no</span><span>  doubt  that  if  barristers  were  not  required,  the</span><span>  expense  would  be  lessened.  True,  there  had  been</span><span>  some  talk  about  the  advantages  of  the  division  of</span><span>  labour  ;  but  the  fact  was,  that  it  required  the</span><span>  very  same  description  of  learning  to  make  a  good</span><span>  attorney  as  it  did  to  make  a  good  barrister.  It</span><span>  therefore  was  not  a  division  of  labour  ;  it  was  a</span><span>  multiplication  of  labour-to  create  expense.  It</span><span>  was  not  a  only  a  waste  of  human  labour,  but  a</span><span>  waste  for  which  the  community  were,'  by  the  mo-</span><span>  nopoly,  forced  to  pay.  It  could  not  be  defended</span><span>  in  the  profession  of  the  law,  more  than  it  could  be</span><span>  in  the  most  familiar  callings.""</span></p> <p><span>  The  original  motion  was  passed  by  16  to  9  ;</span></p> <p><span>  and  the  Bill  read  a  first  time.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Council,on  the  motion  of  Mr.  WENTWORTH,</span><span>  resolved  to  address  His  Excellency  the  Governor,</span><span>  praying  that  he  would  be  pleased  to  place  on  the</span><span>  Estimates  of  Expenditure  for  the  ensuing  year,  a</span><span>  sum  not  exceeding  £1000,  for  liquidating  the</span><span>  debt  due  for  the  erection  of  a  Jewish  Synagogue</span><span>  in  Sydney  ;  and  a  sum  not  exceeding  £200  for</span><span>  the  support  of  a  Jewish  Minister  of  religion.</span></p> <p><span>  SEPTEMBER  16.</span></p> <p><span>  The  COLONIAL  SECRETARY  said  that  it  was  not</span></p> <p><span>  the  intention  of  Government  to  enter  into  any</span><span>  new  postal  arrangements  during  the  present</span><span>  session,  in  order  to  allow  time  to  the  Commis-</span><span>  sioners  who  had  been  sent  out  from  Home  to</span><span>  make  their  report.</span></p> <p><span>  A  Select  Committee  of  seven  members  was  ap-</span><span>  pointed  to  take  into  consideration  the  best  means</span><span>  of  establishing  steam  communication  between  this</span><span>  colony  and  England.</span></p> <p><span>  The  SPEAKER  read  the  following  minute  from</span><span>  his  Excellency  the  Governor  :--</span></p> <p><span>  1.  The  Governor  finds  that,  on  the  9th  of  June</span><span>  last,  his  predecessor  submitted  to  the  Council  an</span><span>  estimate  for  the  year  1847,  as  well  as  a  supple-</span><span>  mentary  estimate  for  the  year  1846.  These  esti-</span><span>  mates  he  adopts,  and  now  re-submits  for  the  con-</span><span>  sideration  of  the  Council,  with  certain  alterations</span><span>  and  additions,  which  will  be  found  detailed  in  the</span><span>  two  accompanying  statements.</span></p> <p><span>  The  total  amount  of  the  additional  estimate  for</span><span>  1847  is,  it  will  be  seen,  £42,110  17s.  5d.  This,  at</span></p> <p><span>  first  sight,  will  appeal  to  be  a  large  addition  ;  but</span><span>  it  is  to  be  borne  in  mind  that  a  portion  of  it  is</span><span>  merely  nominal,  whilst  by  far  the  largest  amount</span><span>  of  the  increase  arises  from  the  restoration  of  the</span><span>  estimates  for  the  Border  and  Native  Police,  which</span><span>  were  omitted  by  his  predecessor  in  consequence  of</span><span>  the  contemplated  expiration  of  the  Act,  2  Vic,  No.</span><span>  27.  In  reality,  therefore,  this  charge  will  not</span><span>  constitute  any  actual  increase  in  the  expenditure</span><span>  of  the  colony  ;  though,  as  the  revenue  to  meet  it</span><span>  has  ceased  with  the  expiration  of  the  Act,  it  will</span><span>  henceforth  have  to  be  defrayed  out  of  the  ordinary</span><span>  revenue,  so  soon  as  the  unexpended  balance  raised</span><span>  by  the  assessment  on  stock,  and  amounting  on</span><span>  31st  December  last  to  £17,204,  shall  have  been</span><span>  exhausted.  Whether  it  will  be  possible  in  future</span><span>  to  provide  for  this  expenditure  out  of  the  ordinary</span><span>  revenue,  is  a  question  which  will  require  the</span><span>  serious  attention  of  the  Government  and  the  Coun-</span><span>  cil  ;  but  in  the  meantime,  with  the  unexpended</span><span>  balance  raised  by  assessment,  and  the  pressing</span><span>  necessity  which  appears  to  exist  of  affording  an</span><span>  adequate  protection  to  the  important  interests  now</span><span>  engaged  beyond  the  boundaries  of  location,  the</span><span>  Governor  has  not  thought  himself  justified  in  de-</span><span>  clining  to  submit  to  the  Council  an  estimate  for</span><span>  this  expenditure.</span></p> <p><span>  3.  The  addition  caused  by  laying  before  the</span><span>  Council  the  estimates  for  the  Courts  of  Requests</span><span>  amounting  to.  £4,560  3  9</span><span>  and  for  the  Insolvent  Courts  .  ..  £1,065  16  3</span></p> <p><span>  together  ......  £5,626  0  0</span></p> <p><span>  is  also  of  a  nominal  description.  The  expenses  of</span><span>  these  Courts  will,  it  is  estimated,  be  covered,,  or</span><span>  nearly  so.  by  the  amount  of  fees  which  will  be</span><span>  paid  into  the  Treasury,  instead  of  being  applied,</span><span>  as  at  present,  directly  to  pay  the  salaries  and  ex-</span><span>  penses  thereby  incurred.</span></p> <p><span>  4.  The  Governor  has  preferred  the  present</span><span>  course  of  submitting  the  estimates  of  these  de-</span><span>  partments  to  the  consideration  and  revision  of  the</span><span>  Council,  to  that  which  appears  has  for  the  last  few</span><span>  years  been  adopted  by  his  predecessor,  under  the</span><span>  permanent  appropriations  made  by  the  Acts  hav-</span><span>  ing  reference  to  these  Courts  ;  but  it  is  right  that</span><span>  the  Council  should  distinctly  understand,  that,</span><span>  unless  these  expenses  be  provided  for,  he  knows</span><span>  of  no  other  source  from  which  they  can  be  de-</span><span>  frayed  ;  the  funds  under  Schedule  A  of  the  Con-</span><span>  stitutional  Act  for  the  Administration  of  Justice,</span><span>  being  entirely  exhausted  by  the  other  expenses</span><span>  properly  chargeable  thereon.</span></p> <p><span>  5.  A  portion  of  another  item  also,  is  seemingly,</span><span>  though  only  nominally,  an  addition  to  the  Esti-</span><span>  mates  as  originally  submitted,  namely,  the  expense</span><span>  for  roads,  bridges,  and  ferries,  in  the  County  of</span><span>  Cumberland,  amounting  to  £5000,  which  is  at</span><span>  present  defrayed  from  tolls  collected  under  the</span><span>  authority  of  the  Act,  2  W.  4,  No.  12,  sec.  34  ;</span><span>  but  for  which  it  has  been  thought  proper  to  bring</span><span>  an  estimate  under  the  revision  of  the  Council.</span></p> <p><span>  6.  The  present  authorised  establishment  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Water  Police  the  Governor  is  led  to  believe  is  not</span><span>  more  than  adequate  for  the  duties,  and  he  has  in</span><span>  consequence  adopted  it,  as  more  specific  in  its</span><span>  details,  and  more  satisfactory  than  that  originally</span><span>  proposed.</span></p> <p><span>  7.  The  following  statement  will  show  more</span><span>  clearly  the  nature  of  the  proposed  additions  to  the</span><span>  estimates  for  1847,  as  now  submitted  :</span></p> <p><span>  £  s.  d.  £  s.  d.</span><span>  From  the  amended</span><span>  estimate  of  the  Water</span></p> <p><span>  Police  for  Sydney  and</span></p> <p><span>  Port  Phillip.  867  17  10</span></p> <p><span>  Is  to  be  deducted</span></p> <p><span>  The  estimate  for  the</span><span>  same  service  as  ori-</span></p> <p><span>  ginally  submitted.  ..  6Z0  0  0</span></p> <p><span>  Leaving  the  real</span></p> <p><span>  addition  only.'  217  17  10</span></p> <p><span>  If,  therefore,  from</span><span>  the  total  amount  of</span><span>  the  proposed  addi-</span></p> <p><span>  tions  to  the  estimates</span></p> <p><span>  for  the  year  1847  ...  42,110  17  5</span></p> <p><span>  Are  deducted  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  reasons  assigned-</span><span>  The  expenses  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Courts  of  Requests..  4,560  3  9</span></p> <p><span>  The  expenses  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Insolvent  Courts....  1,065  16  3</span></p> <p><span>  Roads,  Bridges,  &</span><span>  Ferries,  chargeable</span></p> <p><span>  on  tolls.  5,000  0  0</span></p> <p><span>  The  estimate  of  the</span><span>  expense  of  the  Water</span><span>  Police,  as  originally</span></p> <p><span>  submitted.  650  0  0</span></p> <p><span>  -11,276  0  0</span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  The  real  addition</span></p> <p><span>  will  be.  30,834  17  5</span></p> <p><span>  Of  which  £23,073  18s.  4d.  is  to  provide  for  the</span><span>  Native  and  Border  Police,  and  which,  as  already</span><span>  explained,  is  not  a  new  item  of  expenditure.</span></p> <p><span>  The  estimates  for  these  latter  services,  it  will  be</span><span>  perceived,  have  been  framed  upon  the  appropria-</span><span>  tions  made  for  them  by  the  Council  for  the  first</span><span>  half  of  the  present  year  ;  the  Governor  has,  how-</span><span>  ever,  been  induced  in  same  degree  to  modify  them.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  understood  to  be  the  general  wish  that</span><span>  Petty  Sessions  should  be  established  beyond  the</span><span>  boundaries  of  location,  he  has  in  consequence  pro-</span><span>  posed  that  the  sum  of  £3000  should  be  appropri-</span><span>  ated  for  this  service  in  1847.  It  has  been  found</span><span>  impossible  to  prepare,  at  present,  any  more  detailed</span><span>  estimate  of  this  expense  than  that  submitted  ;  but</span><span>  if  the  amount  be  voted,  the  Council  may  rely  on</span><span>  its  being  expended  in  the  most  economical  manner,</span><span>  so  as  to  ensure  the  object  contemplated.</span></p> <p><span>  9.  It  has  also  been  represented  that,  as  the</span><span>  duties  of  the  Commissioners  will  now  be  in  a  great</span><span>  measure  confined  to  regulating  and  aiding  in  the</span><span>  collection  of  the  license  fees,  and  in  other  respects</span><span>  acting  as  guardians  of  the  Crown  lands,  their  re-</span><span>  muneration  ought  probably  to  be  charged  on  the</span><span>  Crown  revenues.  It  has,  accordingly,  been  pro-</span><span>  posed,  that  the  estimated  charge  on  the  general</span><span>  revenue  should  be  reduced  by  transferring  the</span><span>  amount  of  their  salaries  and  allowances  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  Crown  revenues.</span></p> <p><span>  The  estimates  for  the  Border  and  Native  Police</span><span>  are,  therefore,  confined  to  the  amount  required  for</span><span>  preserving  the  peace  in  the  districts  beyond  the</span></p> <p><span>  limits  of  location.</span></p> <p><span>  10.

"<p><span>  NEW  ZEALAND.</span></p> <p><span>  (From  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald,  Oct.  23.)</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  Port  Nicholson  papers  to  the  23rd</span><span>  ultimo.  All  was  quiet  in  the  south.  Rangi-</span><span>  haeata  was  endeavouring  to  raise  a  party;  but  the</span><span>  vigorous  proceedings  of  Governor  Grey  had  had</span><span>  such  an  effect  upon  the  natives,  that  even  those</span></p> <p><span>  hostile  to  the  Government  were  afraid  to  exhibit</span><span>  their  hostility  by  any  overt  acts.  A  court  martial</span><span>  was  sitting  for  the  trial  of  some  of  the  natives,</span><span>  who,  after  professing  to  be  friendly,  had  joined</span><span>  the  enemy.  Two  were  convicted,  one  of  whom</span><span>  was  executed.  The  presence  of  the  troops  had</span><span>  caused  a  great  demand  for  fresh  meat:  the  con-</span><span>  tract  for  supplying  them  was  taken  at  11¾d.,  and</span><span>  13½d.  per  lb.</span></p> <p></p> <p><span>  EXECUTION  OF  ONE  OF  THE  REBELS.—The</span><span>  court  martial  appointed  to  try  the  rebels  who  were</span><span>  made  prisoners  during  the  late  military  operations,</span></p> <p><span>  commenced  its  sittings  at  the  camp  at  Parramatta</span><span>  Point,  Porirua,  on  Monday  morning.  The  court</span><span>  was  composed  of  the  following  members:—Major</span></p> <p><span>  Arney,  58th  Regt.,  president  ;  Captain  O'Connell,</span><span>  Captain  Newingham,  65th  ;  Captain  Armstrong</span></p> <p><span>  Captain  Reid,  99th  ;  Captain  Laye,  58th  Regts.  ;</span><span>  and  the  Hon.  W.  Yelverton,  Royal  Artillery.</span><span>  Mr.  Servantes  acted  as  interpreter.  The  prisoners</span><span>  who  were  confined  on  board  the  Calliope,  were</span><span>  landed  early  on  Monday  morning,  and  were  de-</span><span>  livered  over  to  the  custody  of  the  military.  The</span><span>  first  prisoner  tried  was  Rangihaeata,  one  of  the</span><span>  scouts  captured  by  the  Ngatitoas  at  Pauatahanui,</span><span>  on  the  1st  of  August.  This  man  either  is  or</span><span>  affects  to  be  insane,  and  in  consequence  of  the</span><span>  doubt  entertained  of  his  sanity  has  escaped  the</span><span>  extreme  penalty  of  the  law,  but  has  been  sentenced</span><span>  to  be  imprisoned  for  life.  Martin  Luther,  whose</span><span>  native  name  is  Wareaitu,  and  who  was  taken  pri-</span><span>  soner  on  the  march  by  the  militia  about  the  same</span><span>  time  was  tried  the  following  day.  This  native</span><span>  was  brother  to  Rangihaeata,  and  was  a  chief  of</span><span>  considerable  influence  at  Wanganui.  He  was  tried</span><span>  on  two  counts,  the  first  charging  him  with  having</span><span>  been  engaged  in  the  attack  on  the  troops  on  the</span><span>  16th  June,  and  the  second  count  with  having</span><span>  been  taken  in  arms  against  the  peace  of  the  Queen,</span><span>  and  with  having  joined  the  rebels  under  Rangi-</span><span>  haeata.  To  the  latter  count,  he  pleaded  guilty.</span><span>  The  forms  of  the  court  were  extremely  simple,</span><span>  and  appeared  to  be  perfectly  understood  by  the</span><span>  natives.  The  principal  evidence  brought,  forward</span><span>  was  that  of  the  two  natives  who  took  him  prisoner,</span><span>  and  that  of  two  native  women,  who  proved  that</span><span>  they  had  seen  the  prisoner  in  Rangihaeata's  pah,</span><span>  and  that  he  had  acted  with  Rangihaeata's  party.</span><span>  The  prisoner  admitted  the  correctness  of  the  evi-</span><span>  dence  and  was  found  guilty  and  was  sentenced</span><span>  to  be  hanged.  The  prisoner,  throughout  the  pro-</span><span>  ceeding  manifested,  the  utmost;  coolness  and  self</span><span>  possession.  He  admitted  that  he  made  a  great</span><span>  mistake  in  joining  Rangihaeata,  and  has  written</span><span>  to  his  friends  at  Wanganui  dissuading  them  from</span><span>  engaging  in  hostilities  against  the  government.</span><span>  He  said  he  was  not  afraid  to  die,  and  only  re-</span><span>  gretted  that  he  was  not  shot  or  tomakawked  in-</span><span>  stead  of  having  been  taken  prisoner.  The  Rev.</span><span>  H.  Govett,  who  was  in  the  neighbourhood  on  his</span><span>  return  to  Waikanae,  on  the  evening  previous  to</span><span>  the  execution  was  sent  for,  and  arrived  at  the</span><span>  camp  on  six  o'clock  on  Thursday  morning,  and</span><span>  remained  with  the  prisoner  during  his  last  mo-</span><span>  ments.  The  gallows  was  erected  about  three</span><span>  hundred  yards  from  the  stockade  inclosing  the</span><span>  camp,  near  a  long  conical  sand-hill,  and  was</span><span>  about  sixteen  feet  high,  with  a  platform  raised</span><span>  about  ten  feet  from  the  ground,  and  with  one  end</span><span>  resting  on  the  sand-hill.  At  eight  o'clock  the</span><span>  prisoner  was  led  out,  guarded  by  the  armed  police,</span><span>  and  followed  by  a  detachment  of  soldiers,  who</span><span>  formed  three  sides  of  a  square  in  front  of  the</span><span>  place  of  execution,  the  fourth  side  being  occupied</span><span>  by  the  police  and  the  scaffold,  which  was  in  the</span><span>  centre.  Sentries  were  posted  along  the  ditch  of</span><span>  the  camp,  who  kept  the  spectators  (about  twenty</span><span>  Europeans  and  fifteen  natives)  at  a  distance  of</span><span>  one  hundred  and  fifty  yards  from  the  place  of</span><span>  execution.  After  his  handcuffs  were  removed,  the</span><span>  prisoner  was  pinioned,  and  was  led  along  the</span><span>  sand-hill  to  the  scaffold.  He  walked  with  a  firm</span><span>  step,  and  showed  no  symptoms  of  fear  at  his  ap-</span><span>  proaching  end,  and  stood  perfectly  erect  while  the</span><span>  fatal  rope  was  adjusted  round  his  neck.  Every-</span><span>  thing  being  in  readiness,  the  drop  fell,  and  the</span><span>  prisoner  was  launched  into  eternity  :  for  a  few</span><span>  seconds  he  remained  perfectly  motionless,  and</span><span>  then  after  a  few  convulsive  struggles  life  was</span><span>  extinct.  No  cap  was  drawn  over  the  face  of  the</span><span>  prisoner  previous  to  his  execution,  and  the  body</span><span>  after  remaining  the  usual  time  was  cut  down.</span><span>  From  the  early  hour  at  which  it  occurred,  the</span><span>  natives  belonging  to  the  Taupo  pah  were  too  late</span><span>  to  witness  the  execution,  having  stayed  to  get</span><span>  their  breakfast  ;  but  the  greater  part  arrived  pre-</span><span>  vious  to  the  body  being  cut  down,  and  with  the</span><span>  exception  of  a  few  of  the  old  men,  appeared  to</span><span>  concur  in  the  justice  of  the  sentence,  and  approved</span><span>  of  its  having  been  put  into  execution.—New</span><span>  Zealand  Spectator,  September  16.</span></p> <p><span>  (From  the  Australian,  October  24.)</span></p> <p><span>  Intelligence  from  Auckland  to  the  16th  Sep-</span><span>  tember  had  reached  Wellington  by  the  steamer</span><span>  Driver.

We  confess</span><span>  this  result  surprises  us.  What  the  present  popu-</span><span>  lation  beyond  the  boundaries  may  be,  we  do  not</span><span>  yet  know,  but  shall  soon  be  informed  by  the  pub-</span><span>  lication  of  the  Census  Tables.  Taking,  however,</span><span>  the  population  given  by  the  Census  of  the  year</span><span>  1841,  the  proportion  of  licenses  is  not  one  in  ten  ;</span><span>  at  the  present  time  it  cannot,  we  should  think,  be</span><span>  one  in  twenty.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  stated  in  a  note  on  the  face  of  the  return,</span><span>  that  the  returns  for  the  Port  Phillip  district  had</span><span>  not  then  been  received  in  a  complete  form.  These</span><span>  returns  have  yet,  therefore,  to  be  laid  before  the</span><span>  Council  ;  and  we  would  suggest  to  the  Colonial</span><span>  Treasurer,  that  while  he  is  completing  the  return</span><span>  in  that  particular,  it  would  be  well  to  make  the</span><span>  general  return  complete  for  the  year,  by  bringing</span><span>  it  down  to  the  date  specified  in  the  address.</span></p> <p><span>  PORK.</span></p> <p><span>  (  From  the  Hobart  Town  Advertiser.  )</span></p> <p><span>  It  has  been  a  pretty  general  complaint  against</span><span>  colonial  cured  meat  that  it  will  not  keep  properly,</span><span>  and  in  consequence  an  immense  quantity  of  beef</span><span>  shipped  from  New  South  Wales  and  Port  Phillip</span></p> <p><span>  was  condemned  at  home.  Whether  this  arose</span></p> <p><span>  from  the  condition  of  the  cattle  before  being</span><span>  killed,  from  the  salt,  the  climate,  the  time  of  the</span><span>  year,  ignorance  of  the  mode  of  salting,  negligence,</span><span>  or  a  concatenation  of  some  or  all  of  them,  we</span><span>  know  not,  but  we  are  pleased  to  hear  that  later</span><span>  shipments  have  turned  out  better,  and  perhaps  in</span><span>  time  Australian  salt  beef  may  rank  with  that  of</span><span>  Ireland  or  Hamburgh.  Meantime  we  have  some</span><span>  doubts  on  the  subject,  because  it  is  our  firm  con-</span><span>  viction,  founded  on  a  good  deal  of  experience,  that</span><span>  climate  has  much  to  do  with  the  proper  curing  of</span><span>  moat.  That  to  be  thoroughly  impregnated  with</span><span>  salt  so  as  to  undergo  that  chemical  combination</span><span>  which  prevents  decay,  without  materially  injuring</span><span>  the  nutritious  properties  of  the  meat,  there  must</span><span>  be  a  degree  of  moisture  in  the  atmosphere,  com-</span><span>  bined  with  a  temperature  so  low  as  to  prevent  in-</span><span>  cipient  putrefaction,  yet  not  so  low  as  to  coagulate</span><span>  the  pieces  of  the  meat,  and  thus  prevent  the  proper</span><span>  absorption  of  the  salt.  It  is  well  known  that  in</span><span>  Ireland,  where  there  is  more  beef  salted  than  in  all</span><span>  the  world  beside,  the  season  is  principally  confined</span><span>  to  two  months  in  the  year,  which  answer  these</span><span>  requisites,  from  the  middle  of  October  to  the  latter</span><span>  end  of  December,  and  that  the  setting  in  of  the</span><span>  frost  has  an  injurious  tendency.  For  this  reason</span><span>  we  believe  that  the  winter  of  this  colony  is  better</span><span>  suited  to  the  curing  of  meat  than  that  of  the  ad-</span><span>  jacent  colonies,  and  though  it  is  not  probable  that</span><span>  we  can  salt  beef  to  any  very  great  extent,  there  is</span><span>  no  doubt  that  pork  can  be  well  and  effectually</span><span>  cured,  if  only  the  attempt  were  encouraged  at  the</span><span>  outset.  We  know  that  the  curing  can  be  most</span><span>  effectually  performed,  having  seen  and  eaten  some</span><span>  which  Mr.  Ladds,  of  Elizabeth-street,  salted  for  a</span><span>  Commissariat  contract  fifteen  months  ago.  For</span><span>  some  reason  or  other  the  tender  was  not  accepted,</span><span>  and  as  we  said,  of  some  which  he  still  has,  we  eat</span><span>  a  few  days  since.  The  quality  and  condition</span><span>  proved  most  decidedly  that  pork  can  be  cured  here</span><span>  equal  to  that  of  any  country  ;  we  shall  not  even</span><span>  except  Ireland.  It  was  firm,  close,  sound,</span><span>  thoroughly,  yet  not  over  salted,  and  exhibited  that</span><span>  first-rate  quality  of  not  boiling  out  or  shrinking</span><span>  in  cooking,  We  think  that  our  small  farmers</span><span>  might  turn  their  attention  to  this  subject  with  ad-</span><span>  vantage.  It  is  among  men  of  this  class  that  the</span><span>  innumerable  pigs  which  supply  the  navies  of</span><span>  England,  which  form  so  large  an  export  in  every</span><span>  British  colony,  are  reared  and  fattened.  We  do</span><span>  not  believe  that  on  a  large  scale,  or  as  an  exclusive</span><span>  branch  of  farming,  it  would  pay  ;  but  as  adjunct</span><span>  to  the  other  stock,  that  pigs  might  be  raised  suffi-</span><span>  cient  to  supply  at  least  our  own  shipping,  thus</span><span>  keeping  much  of  the  capital  in  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  INDIA.</span></p> <p><span>  (  From  the  Launceston  Examiner.  )</span></p> <p><span>  By  the  way  of  Mauritius  we  have  an  important</span></p> <p><span>  notice  of  Indian  affairs.</span></p> <p><span>  The  principal  news  contained  in  the  Calcutta</span><span>  journals  to  the  10th  May,  is  an  account  of  a  dis-</span><span>  turbance  that  had  broken  out  in  Lahore,  arising</span><span>  from  a  European  sentry  of  artillery  severely</span><span>  wounding  a  bullock  with  a  bayonet.  The  party</span><span>  to  whom  it  belonged  raised  a  hue  and  cry,  and</span><span>  ran  away  telling  all  he  met  that  the  Europeans</span><span>  had  killed  his  bullock,  and  that  the  city  had  been</span><span>  polluted.  This  was  of  course  too  readily  believed</span><span>  by  some  Seikhs,  and  immediately  taken  advantage</span><span>  of:  all  shops  were  immediately  closed,  and  a</span><span>  dreadful  riot  was  the  consequence.  The  insti-</span><span>  gators  of  the  riot,  fourteen  in  number,  had  been</span><span>  apprehended  and  sentenced  to  lose  their  right</span><span>  hands  ;  and  all  the  houses  that  were  in  the</span><span>  neighbourhood  of  the  scene  of  action,  and  from</span><span>  which  brickbats  were  flung,  raised  to  the  ground.</span><span>  This  for  the  sake  of  example.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Maharajah  had  paid  a  state  visit  to  Major</span><span>  Lawrence,  the  political  agent,  upon  the  subject,</span><span>  and  here  the  matter  remained.</span></p> <p><span>  The  other  great  event  in  the  Punjaub  is  the</span><span>  continued  refusal  of  the  Killadar  of  Kote  Kangra</span><span>  to  surrender  that  fort  to  the  British  authorities.</span><span>  The  force  despatched  to  take  the  charge  of  it  was</span><span>  attended  by  Captain  Cunningham  and  Runjoor</span><span>  Singh,  the  latter  of  whom  sent  in  his  parwanah</span><span>  to  the  commandant  to  give  up  the  place.  -It  was</span><span>  treated  with  the  utmost  contempt,  and  the  mes-</span><span>  senger  was  kicked  out  of  the  place  ;  the  Mahara-</span><span>  jah's  order  was  then  sent  in,  but  found  no  better</span><span>  treatment,  a  haughty  defiance  being  hurled</span><span>  against  the  chief,  the  Maharajah,  and  the  British.</span><span>  A  couple  of  regiments  were  ordered  up  to  reduce</span><span>  it,  under  Brigadier  Wheeler,  and  it  was  not  anti-</span><span>  cipated  that  much  trouble  would  be  incurred  in</span><span>  the  task,  though  to  Oriental  attacks  the  spot  had</span><span>  hitherto  been  considered  impregnable.  The  Dur-</span><span>  bar,  irritated  at  the  news,  had  set  on  foot  a  search</span><span>  in  Lahore  for  the  relatives  of  the  officers  and</span><span>  soldiers  garrisoning  the  refractory  fortress,  in</span><span>  order  to  imprison  them.</span></p> <p><span>  A  few  days  later,  in  the  Delhi  Gazette,  May  4,</span><span>  we  learn  that  the  44th  N.I.,  had  taken  possession</span><span>  of  the  fort  of  Mulkera,  and  occupied  the  town  of</span><span>  Kangra,  where  they  were  exposed  to  a  constant</span><span>  fire,  without  any  loss.  The  country  people  had</span><span>  risen  to  aid  our  troops,  and  a  neighbouring  Rajah</span><span>  had  lent  three  guns.  Major  Lawrence  was  daily</span><span>  expected.  Great  preparations  were  making  for</span><span>  the  reduction  of  the  fortress,  already  in  a  state  of</span><span>  blockade.  The  besieged  were  actively  engaged  in</span><span>  strengthening  their  position,  by  opening  new  em</span><span>  brazures,  defending  their  magazines  from  the</span><span>  bombs,  and  in  undermining  the  ramparts  where</span><span>  they  were  most  accessible  ;  they  had  given  the</span><span>  British  force  proofs  of  their  skill  as  marksmen,</span><span>  one  of  the  Seikhs  having  directed  a  cannon  towards</span><span>  the  house  in  the  town,  occupied  by  the  Officers  for</span><span>  their  mess,  the  second  ball  traversed  the  wall  and</span><span>  passed  over  the  table,  just  before  the  dinner  was</span><span>  placed  on  it.  Fortunately,  no  person  was  in  the</span><span>  room.  The  beseiged  had  set  fire  to  several  parts</span><span>  of  the  town,  by  firing  rockets  during  the  night;</span><span>  our  troops  were  obliged  to  assist  in  putting  it  out.</span></p> <p><span>  It  was  reported  that  Brig.

We  learn  from  the  Hobart  Town</span><span>  Courier  of  the  9th  instant,  that  a  meeting  of  the</span><span>  members  of  this  society  was  held  on  the  8th  inst.,</span><span>  ""  to  take  into  consideration  a  despatch  of  his  Ex-</span><span>  cellency  the  Lieutenant-Governor,  of  date  the  1st</span><span>  August,  1845,  addressed  to  Lord  Stanley,  and</span><span>  published  by  order  of  the  House  of  Commons,</span><span>  purporting  to  be  a  commentary  on  the  petition  of</span><span>  the  inhabitants  of  Van  Diemen's  Land,  against</span><span>  the  present  systen  of  transportation,  so  far  as  that</span><span>  despatch  bears  on  the  credit  and  character  of  the</span><span>  petitioners.

At  this  meeting  various</span><span>  resolutions  were  passed,  quoting  extracts  from  the</span><span>  despatch  referred  to,  and  contradicting  the  state-</span><span>  ments  they  contain,  and  the  last  (which  was  moved</span><span>  by  Messrs.

With  the</span><span>  utmost  pain,  therefore,  but  as  a  necessary  sacrifice</span><span>  to  truth  and  justice,  the  members  of  this  Associa-</span><span>  tion  are  compelled  to  declare  publicly  that  it  ceases</span><span>  to  consider  Sir  John  E.

One  of  the  black</span><span>  women  who  frequent  Mr.  Gibson's  station,  had  a</span><span>  puppy  of  which  she  became  very  fond  ;  she  was</span><span>  constantly  lamenting  that  she  could  not  procure</span><span>  it  a  sufficiency  of  delicate  food  ;  in  order  to  supply</span><span>  it,  while  the  males  of  her  tribe  were  out  hunting,</span><span>  she  killed  her  own  infant  child,  in  order  that  the</span><span>  milk  given  to  it  might  be  preserved  for  her  fa-</span><span>  vourite.—His  Excellency  the  Governor  has  made</span><span>  the  following  appointments  in  the  Customs  Depart-</span><span>  ment,  at  Twofold  Bay,  viz.  :  Hamon  Massie,  Esq.,</span><span>  to  be  sub-collector,  and  Edmund  Gibbes,  Esq.,  to</span><span>  be  landing  waiter.—In  1843  the  estimated  value</span><span>  of  the  salt  meat  imported  into  the  colony  was</span><span>  £19,286  ;  in  1844,  £3355  ;  in  1845,  £5200.</span><span>  The  export  in  1843  was  £13,924  ;  in  1844,</span><span>  £18,730  ;  and  in  1845,  £12,163.—A  land  sale  at</span><span>  Port  Phillip  had  realized  £3549  16s.  9d.—The</span><span>  Melbourne  Argus  states  that  an  order  had  been</span><span>  issued  by  the  local  Executive,  authorising  the  offi-</span><span>  cers  of  the  various  protectorate  establishments  to</span><span>  seize  and  kill  for  the  use  of  the  blacks,  all  un-</span><span>  branded  cattle  above  the  age  of  twelve  months.—</span><span>  The  result  of  Petrel's  (the  Port  Phillip  race  horse)</span><span>  repeated  defeats  had  reached  Port  Phillip,  and</span><span>  created  a  strong  feeling  of  disappointment.</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><span>  RIDING  AND  DRIVING.—One  coachman  will</span></p> <p><span>  hustle  along  a  heavy,  lazy  team,  that  another</span><span>  equally  good  can  scarcely  keep  his  time  with  ;  but</span><span>  give  a  team  of  regular  larking,  fly-away  devils  to</span><span>  the  latter,  he  will  keep  them  together,  in  temper</span><span>  and  pace,  better  than  the  former,  who  would  per-</span><span>  haps  be  too  rude  with  them.  He  could  drive  all</span><span>  sorts  :  so  they  both  could,  but  neither  of  them  all</span><span>  sorts  equally  well.  So  in  riding,  one  man  excels</span><span>  on  a  light-mouthed,  nervous,  fidgetty  horse  :  he</span><span>  will  coax  him  across  country,  and  prevent  him</span><span>  taking  too  much.out  of  himself.  This  can  only</span><span>  be  done  by  sitting  quite  still  on  him,  having  fine</span><span>  delicate  hands,  patience,  and  temper  that  nothing</span><span>  can  disturb.  Another  shines  on  a  violent,  restive,</span><span>  determined  horse  :  here  a  man  must  have  a  seat</span><span>  firm  as  a  Centaur,  arms  and  shoulders  of  cast</span><span>  iron,  and  resolution  and  courage  that  nothing  can</span><span>  daunt.  He  must  also  keep  his  temper,  or,  what</span><span>  is  bad  to  begin  with,  he  will  render  it  quite  un-</span><span>  manageable  before  his  business  is  done.  Temper</span><span>  is  also  a  sine  qua  non  in  a  coachman  :  it  is  even</span><span>  more  necessary  than  in  a  horseman,  for  the  sake</span><span>  of  others.  An  irritated  horse  bolts  off  with  his</span><span>  rider,  or  throws  him,  or  both  ;  he  alone  pays  the</span><span>  penalty  of  his  fault  :  but  an  irritated  horse  in</span><span>  harness,  particularly  in  a  light  private  carriage,</span><span>  is  perfectly  awful.  We  may  and  can  manage  him</span><span>  as  a  wheeler  to  a  coach  ;  the  weight  and  his  com-</span><span>  panions  will  hold  him  ;  but,  in  a  light  carriage,</span><span>  let  me  tell  very  young  coachmen  who  may  think</span><span>  they  are  in  little  danger,  that  no  man  living  can</span><span>  hold  two  horses  determined  to  run  away  ;  and  as</span><span>  to  four  all  in  the  same  mind,  they  are  no  more  to</span><span>  be  held  than  a  locomotive  engine,  for  which  reason</span><span>  we  should  never  get  their  steam  up  too  high.—</span></p> <p><span>  Stable-talk  and  Table-talk.</span></p> <p><span>  The  general  order  against  smoking  in  the</span><span>  army  has  occasioned  a  deep  sensation  in  every</span><span>  mess-room  in  the  kingdom,  and  created  such  a</span><span>  panic  in  the  cigar  market,  that  good  sheroots  were</span><span>  down  at  an  unusually  low  figure  and  the  Manillas</span><span>  were  down  at  a  penny,  which  had  been  command-</span><span>  ing  threehalfpence,  with  a  fair  sprinkling  of</span><span>  buyers,  for  the  last  eight  months.  The  cabbage</span><span>  growers  are  in  despair,  for  the  young  officers</span><span>  had  been  the  chief  consumers  of  the  hardy  winter</span><span>  savoy,  which  must  now  be  sold  as  food  for  the</span><span>  lower  classes,  instead  of  being  packed  in  ivory</span><span>  cases  for  mess-room  tables,  as  the  best  Havan-</span><span>  nahs,  imported  direct  from  Havannah  by  the</span><span>  Hammersmith  'bus.  As  to  the  military  them-</span><span>  selves,  meetings  are  being  called  in  every  regi-</span><span>  ment  to  consider  whether  the  officers  shall  coolly</span><span>  submit  to  allow  the  Duke  of  Wellington  to  put  all</span><span>  their  pipes  out.  The  Duke  of  Wellington  has</span><span>  blown  a  cloud  over  the  whole  of  the  army  by  his</span><span>  inconsiderate  endeavour  to  banish  the  cigar  from</span><span>  the  mess-room.  The  officers  naturally  ask  what</span><span>  they  are  to  do  when  they  meet,  for  they  are  to  be</span><span>  restrained  from  boxing,  wrestling,  leap-frog,</span><span>  blind-man's-buff;  as  well  as  prohibited  from</span><span>  smoking,  and  they  dread  the  possibility  of  being</span><span>  thrown  upon  their  conversational  resources,  which</span><span>  must  have  a  most  dreary  effect.  Under  their</span></p> <p><span>  present  trying  position  we  can  offer  no  consolation</span><span>  to  the  inmates  of  the  barracks,  except  such  as</span><span>  they  may  derive  from  taking  it  by  turns  to  read</span><span>  Punch  aloud  to  the  whole  mess.—Punch.</span></p> <p><span>  Why  is  a  temperance  pledge  like  an  umbrella  ?</span><span>  —Because  it  protects  you  from  heavy  wet.</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></span></p> <p></p> <p><span>  KEEPING  FOWLS.—Hens  will  lay  eggs  perpe-</span><span>  tuaily,  if  treated  in  the  following  manner  ;—Keep</span><span>  no  roosters,  give  the  hens  fresh  meat,  chopped</span><span>  like  fine  sausage  meat,  once  a  day  to  each  hen,</span><span>  during  the  winter,  or  from  the  time  insects  dis-</span><span>  appear  in  the  fall,  till  they  appear  again  in  th«</span><span>  spring.  Never  allow  any  eggs  to  remain  In  the</span><span>  nest  for  what  is  called  nest  eggs.  When  the</span><span>  roosters  do  not  run  with  the  hens,  and  no  eggs  in</span><span>  the  nest,  the  hens  will  not  cease  laying  after  the</span><span>  production  of  twelve  or  fifteen  eggs,  as  they  al-</span><span>  ways  do  when  roosters  and  the  nest  eggs  are  al-</span><span>  lowed  ;  but  continue  laying  perpetually.  My  hens</span><span>  lay  all  winter,  and  from  seventy-five  to  one  hun-</span><span>  dred  eggs  in  succession.  If  the  foregoing  plan</span><span>  was  generally  followed,  eggs  would  be  just  as</span><span>  plentiful  in  winter  as  in  summer.  The  only  reason</span><span>  why  hens  do  not  lay  in  winter  as  freely  as  in  sum-</span><span>  mer,  is  the  want  of  animal  food,  which  they  get</span><span>  in  summer  in  abundance  in  the  form  of  insects.</span><span>  I  have,  for  several  winters,  reduced  my  theory  to</span><span>  practice,  and  proved  its  entire  correctness.  It</span><span>  must  be  observed  that  the  presence  of  the  male  is</span><span>  not  necessary  for  the  production  of  eggs,  as  they</span><span>  are  formed  whether  the  male  be  present  or  not.</span><span>  Of  course  such  eggs  will  not  produce  chickens.</span><span>  When  chickens  are  wanted,  the  roosters  must  of</span><span>  course  run  with  the  hens.—Alban  Cultivator.</span></p> <p><span>  WANT  OF  AFFECTION  AMONG  THE  NEW  ZEA-</span><span>  LANDERS.—Instances  of  attachment  or  friendship</span><span>  are  very  rarely  to  be  seen  amongst  the  New  Zea-</span><span>  landers.  Occasionally  there  are  some  manifesta-</span><span>  tions  of  this  in  young  girls  towards  each  other,</span><span>  but  I  have  not  seen  any  instance  of  it  in  the  other</span><span>  sex.  They  show  much  general  kindness  of  man-</span><span>  ner  towards  each  other,  but  no  warmth  of  attach-</span><span>  ment  worthy  the  name  of  friendship.  Indeed,  they</span><span>  evince  the  same  degree  of  kindness  towards  stran-</span><span>  gers  as  they  do  to  individuals  of  their  own  tribe,</span><span>  or  members  of  their  own  family.  It  is  more  com-</span><span>  mon  to  perceive  attachments  between  them  and</span><span>  their  dogs  and  pigs  ;  the  latter  arc  frequently</span><span>  great  favourites,  especially  with  old  women,  who</span><span>  may  often  be  seen  caressing  and  talking  with</span><span>  them  in  the  most  affectionate  manner.  Perhaps</span><span>  it-'would  not  be  overstating  their  character  to  say,</span><span>  that,  as  a  people,  they  are  totally  devoid  of  natural</span><span>  affection.  Their  custom  of  abandoning  their  sick,</span><span>  although  this,  no  doubt,  proceeds  greatly  from</span><span>  the  superstitious  belief  that  they  are  fated  to  die,</span><span>  still  evinces  a  great  want  of  natural  affection,  or</span><span>  they  could  not  do  so.  The  same  thing  is  seen</span><span>  even  in  children,  who  as  soon  as  they  are  able,</span><span>  cease  to  have  the  dependence  upon  their  parents,</span><span>  and  cultivate  a  piece  of  ground  for  their  own  sub-</span><span>  sistence.  Should  the  parents,  on  the  other  hand,</span><span>  be  in  want,  they  will  have  fully  an  equal,  if  not  a</span><span>  better  chance  of  being  assisted  by  some  other  in-</span><span>  dividuals  of  the  tribe  than  by  their  own  children  ;</span><span>  and  would  thus  owe  to  general  kindness  that</span><span>  which  should  flow  from  parental  affection  —</span><span>  Browns  New  Zealand  and  its  Aborigines.</span></p> <p><span>  A  GENUINE  PHILANTHROPIST.—""  Patrick  Mac-</span><span>  Kever,  a  poor  Irishman  in  Philadelphia,  was  many</span><span>  years  ago  sentenced  to  be  hung  for  burglary.</span><span>  For  some  reason  or  other  he  was  reprieved  at  the</span><span>  foot  of  the  gallows,  and  his  sentence  changed  to</span><span>  ten  years'  imprisonment.  He  was  a  man  of  few</span><span>  words,  and  hope  seemed  almost  dead  withim  him  ;</span><span>  but  when  Friend  Hooper,  who  became  inspector</span><span>  during  the  latter  part  of  his  term,  talked  to  Him</span><span>  like  a  brother,  his  heart  was  evidently  touched  by</span></p> <p><span>  the  voice  of  kindness.  After  his  release  he  re-</span><span>  turned  to  his  trade,  and  conducted  himself  in  a</span><span>  very  sober,  exemplary  manner.  The  inspector</span><span>  often  met  him,  and  spoke  words  of  friendly  en-</span><span>  couragement.  Things  were  going  on  very  satis-</span><span>  factorily,  when  a  robbery  was  committed  in  tha</span><span>  neighbourhood,  and  Patrick  was  immediately</span><span>  arrested.  His  friend  went  to  the  Mayor,  and</span><span>  enquired  what  proof  there  was  that  he  committed</span><span>  the  robbery.  '  No  proof  ;  but  he  is  an  old  con-</span><span>  vict,  and  that  is  enough  to  condemn  him,""  was</span><span>  the  answer.  '  Nay,  it  is  not  enough,'  replied</span><span>  Friend  Hooper  :  ""  he  has  suffered  severely  for</span><span>  the  crime  he  did  commit,  and  since  he  has  shown</span><span>  the  most  sincere  desire  to  reform,  it  never  ought</span><span>  be  mentioned  against  him  :  I  think  I  know  his</span><span>  stite  of  mind,  and  I  will  take  the  responsibility  of</span><span>  maintaining  that  he  is  not  guilty.'  But  to  all  his</span><span>  urgent  representations,  he  received  the  answer,</span><span>  '  He  is  an  old  convict,  and  that  is  enough.'  The</span><span>  poor  fellow  hung  down  his  head,  and  said  in  tones</span><span>  of  despair,  '  Well,  then,  I  must  make  up  my</span><span>  mind  to  spend  the  remainder  of  my  days  in  pri-</span><span>  son.'  'Thou  wert  not  concerned  in  this  robbery,</span><span>  wert  thou  ?'  said  Isaac,  looking  earnestly  in  his</span><span>  face.  '  Indeed,  I  was  not  :  God  be  my  witness,  I</span><span>  want  to  lead  an  honest  life,  and  be  at  peace  with</span><span>  all  men—but  what  good  will  that  do?  They  will</span><span>  all  say,  He  is  an  old  convict,  and  that  is  enough.'</span><span>  Friend  Hooper  told  him  he  would  stand  by  him.</span><span>  He  did  so  ;  and  offered  to  be  bail  for  his  appear-</span><span>  ance.  The  gratitude  of  the  poor  fellow  was  over-</span><span>  whelming—he  sobbed  like  a  child.  His  innocence</span><span>  was  afterwards  proved,  and  to  the  day  of  his</span><span>  death,  he  continued  a  virtuous  and  useful  citizen.</span><span>  Wh  it  would  have  been  his  fate,  if  no  friend  had</span><span>  appeared  for  him  ?—if  every  human  heart  had</span><span>  refused  to  trust  him  ?""—Mrs.  Child's  Letters.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  CHINESE  CHARACTER.—The  more  the</span><span>  Chinese  come  to  mix  with  us,  and  to  be  acquainted</span><span>  with  our  character,  the  more  they  seem  to  fall</span><span>  into  our  ways  ;  and  we  cannot  but  think  that,  at</span><span>  no  distant  period,  amicable  relations  will  be  es-</span><span>  tablished  without  difficulty,  upon  an  intimate</span><span>  footing.

"<p><span>  COLONIAL  ABSTRACT.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Hobart  Town  Courier  states,  that  the  best</span><span>  labourers  are  still  hurrying  away  from  the  colony.</span><span>  The  51st  regiment  embarked  for  India  on  the  8th</span><span>  ultimo,  in  the  ships  China  and  Agincourt—The</span><span>  blacks  at  Port  Albert,  in  Gipps'  Land,  have  of  late</span><span>  been  very  troublesome,  and  have  killed  a  number</span><span>  of  horses  for  the  sake  of  their  flesh,  of  which  they</span><span>  are  very  fond.  A  horse  belonging  to  Mr.  Oak-</span><span>  den,  imported  at  a  cost  of  450  guineas  had  been</span><span>  thus  destroyed.—The  £5  scrip  of  the  Burra  Burra</span><span>  mines,  in  South  Australia,  was  quoted  at  £80  on</span><span>  the  11th  August.—A  company,  for  the  smelting</span><span>  of  copper  ore,  with  a  capital  of  £10,000,  has  been</span><span>  formed  at  Adelaide.—A  national  system  of  educa-</span><span>  tion  has  been  introduced  into  Western  Australia.</span><span>  —The  township  of  Burra  Burra,  in  South  Austra-</span><span>  lia,  where  the  mines  are  situated,  already  numbers</span><span>  twenty-two  houses,  built  of  stone.—Hops  are  raised</span><span>  at  Mypunga,  South  Australia,  said  to  be  equal  to</span><span>  English  grown  ;  the  price  paid  for  English  hops</span><span>  is  £400  per  ton,  whilst  the  native  grown  can  be</span><span>  raised  for  £50.—Sixty  natives  of  New  Zealand  are</span><span>  said  to  have  been  killed  by  a  sudden  eruption  of</span><span>  lava  about  sixty  miles  north  of  Cook's  Straits.-A</span><span>  nephew  of  a  Mr.  Jervis,  forming  one  of  a  party</span><span>  en  route  to  Adelaide,  with  cattle,  from  the  Lower</span><span>  Murrumbidgee,  has  been  murdered  by  the  blacks</span><span>  near  the  Darling.  On  the  circumstance  becoming</span><span>  known  to  his  companions,  who  were  in  advance,</span><span>  the  whole  party  returned  to  the  scene  of  the  mur-</span><span>  der,  when  they  found  the  blacks  glutting  their</span><span>  savage  thirst  for  blood  by  mutilating  the  body.</span><span>  About  fifty  of  the  natives  presented  a  front  to  the</span><span>  Europeans,  and  with  a  pusillanimity  which  can</span><span>  only  encourage  the  savages  to  renew  the  tragedy</span><span>  on  the  next  party  that  passes,  they  contented  them</span></p> <p><span>  selves  with  the  recovery  of  the  disfigured  and</span><span>  bloody  corpse.—4½  acres  of  Geelong  town  land,</span><span>  put  up  at  the  late  land  sale  at  Melbourne,  realised</span><span>  the  sum  of  £2275,  or  an  average  of  £610  per</span><span>  acre.—Some  of  the  aborigines  in  the  native</span><span>  mounted  police  in  the  district  of  Port  Phillip  are</span><span>  spoken  of  as  models  of  symmetry,  and  maintain  a</span><span>  most  soldier-like  bearing.—A  report  was  current</span><span>  in  Wellington  that  Nene  had  attacked  Heki  in  his</span><span>  pah,  and  had  been  defeated,  the  greater  part  of</span><span>  his  tribe  being  killed,  and  he  himself  taken  prison-</span><span>  er.—Twenty-two  of  the  mutineers  at  Norfolk</span><span>  Island  have  been  tried,  and  two  had  received  sen-</span><span>  tence  of  death  ;  and  death  had  also  been  recorded</span><span>  against  three  others  ;  the  remainder  were  sentenced</span><span>  to  different  terms  of  imprisonment.  Twenty-six</span><span>  were  still  to  be  tried  :  sixteen  on  the  charge  of</span><span>  wilful  murder,  and  ten  for  aiding  and  abetting</span><span>  them.—On  the  31st  ultimo,  a  public  meeting  was</span><span>  held  in  the  market  place,  in  Sydney,  for  the  pur-</span><span>  pose  of  raising  funds  for  alleviating  the  appalling</span></p> <p><span>  distress  at  present  existing  in  Ireland.  The  sum</span><span>  of  £400  was  subscribed.  A  meeting  for  a  similar</span><span>  purpose  had  been  held  in  Melbourne,  where  the</span><span>  subscription  list  already  amounted  to  £500.</span><span>  Among  the  local  improvements  progressing  in</span><span>  Melbourne,  may  be  named  the  new  church  of  St.</span><span>  Peter;  and  a  reservoir,  capable  of  containing</span><span>  20,000  tons  of  water,  about  to  be  formed  at  an</span><span>  expense  of  £1000.  Among  the  new  efforts  of  a</span><span>  commercial  kind,  is  the  establishment  of  a  salt</span><span>  refinery  ;  and  the  building  of  a  ship  of  350  tons.—</span><span>  Mr.  La  Trobe,  the  Superintendent  of  Port  Phillip,</span><span>  arrived  in  Sydney  on  the  27th  ult,  to  pay  his  re-</span><span>  spects  to  the  Governor.—Lady  Mary  Fitzroy  gave</span><span>  her  first  public  party  at  Government  House,  on</span><span>  Tuesday,  the  25th  ult.  The  party  was  a  numerous</span><span>  one  ;  and  nearly  all  who  had  been  honoured  with</span><span>  invitations  attended.—A  gentleman  from  Corn-</span><span>  wall,  recently  arrived  at  Port  Phillip,  has  brought</span><span>  out  a  first-rate  thorough-bred  horse,  six  thorough-</span><span>  bred  pigs,  and  two  thorough-bred  bull  dogs.—</span><span>  About  two  tons  of  copper  ore,  from  the  Rev.  Mr.</span><span>  Bobart's  estate  at  Wellington,  had  been  received</span><span>  in  Sydney,  and  was  about  to  be  smelted  in  order</span><span>  to  see  what  it  would  yield.—It  is  stated  that  the</span><span>  French  authorities  are  in  treaty  with  Messrs.  Boyd</span><span>  and  Co.  for  the  purchase  of  the  steamer  Juno;</span><span>  should  the  contract  be  completed,  she  will  be  com-</span><span>  missioned  for  service  at  Tahiti.—A  petition  to  His</span><span>  Excellency  is  in  progress  in  Melbourne,  praying</span><span>  that  steps  may  be  taken  for  a  survey  of  the  River</span><span>  Yarra,  with  a  view  to  deepening,  so  as  to  allow  of</span><span>  its  free  navigation  by  vessels  of  any  burden.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  ""  DUKE""  AND  HIS  AUTOGRAPH.  —  Field-</span></p> <p><span>  Marshal  the  Duke  of  Wellington—although  he</span><span>  beat  Napoleon—is  a  simple,  ingenuous  soul,  con-</span><span>  tinually  duped  by  a  gang  of  ladies  and  gentlemen,</span><span>  and  others  who—with  a  morbid  taste  for  ink  and</span><span>  paper—pursue  men  of  mark  for  their  autographs.</span><span>  As  the  duke  is  known  to  answer  every  letter—no</span><span>  matter  its  import—addressed  to  him,  all  kinds  of</span><span>  epistles  are  sent  to  him,  for  the  sole  purpose  of</span><span>  drawing  his  Grace  of  his  autograph.  We  have</span><span>  seen  many  of  the  duke's  answers,  and  give  a</span><span>  few  :—""  Field-Marshal  the  Duke  of  Wellington</span><span>  informs  Michael  Wiggins  that  the  coat  he  wore  on</span><span>  the  field  of  Waterloo  was  not  the  original  model  of</span><span>  the  present  D'Orsay  paletot.  The  Comte  D'Orsay</span><span>  is  much  too  honourable  a  man  to  steal  anything</span><span>  from  the  Duke  of  Wellington,  or—as  the  Duke</span><span>  firmly  believes—from  anybody  else.""—""The  Duke</span><span>  of  Wellington  desires  Peter  Snout  to  take  note  that</span><span>  he  is  Commander-in-Chief  of  the  Army,  and  not  a</span><span>  hatter.  Therefore  it  is  not  the  Duke's  business  to</span><span>  see  that  the  wig  of  the  statue  of  George  the  Fourth,</span><span>  Trafalgar-square,  should  be  covered.""—""  Field</span><span>  Marshal  the  Duke  of  Wellington  has  received  John</span><span>  Jones'  letter.  The  late  Duke  of  York's  debts  may</span><span>  be  paid,  and  they  may  not.  The  Duke  of  Wel-</span><span>  lington  informs  John  Jones  that  he  will  not  pay</span><span>  them.""  And  in  this  shameful  manner  is  the</span></p> <p><span>  courtesy  of  the  noble  duke  every  day  played  upon.</span><span>  The  Irish  papers  give  the  last  instance  of  these</span><span>  intrusions  upon  his  Grace's  time,  with,  of  course,</span><span>  the  answer  it  provoked.  Somebody  called  the</span><span>  duke's  attention  to  the  new  cotton  shirts  adopted</span><span>  by  the  army,  and  to  the  potatoe  sickness.  The</span><span>  duke  went  at  once  into  the  shirts,  but  would  not</span><span>  touch  the  potatoes  :—""  Upon  the  other  parts  of</span><span>  Mr.——'s  letter,  that  is,  the  state  of  distress  exist-</span><span>  ing  in  the  neighbourhood  of  ——,  consequent  on</span><span>  what  is  called  the  potatoe  disease,  the  Duke  of</span><span>  Wellington  begs  to  suggest  to  Mr.——,  that  he</span><span>  is  the  Commander-in-chief  of  the  Army.""  And,</span><span>  therefore,  as  Mr.  ——  ought  to  have  known,  is</span><span>  not  compelled  to  cry  ""  eyes  right""  to  the  potatoes,,</span><span>  But  Mr.  ——  already  knew  as  much.  All  he</span><span>  wanted  was  the  duke's  autograph,  and  he  got  it.</span></p> <p><span>  —Punch.</span></p> <p><span>  EXCISE  DUTIES.—The  tales  levied  on  articles</span><span>  of  consumption  produced  within  the  kingdom.</span><span>  The  word  is  derived  from  excido,  to  cut  out,  and</span><span>  means  that  a  good  slice  is  taken  out  of  everything</span><span>  affected  by  the  excise  duties.  They  commenced  in</span><span>  the  reign  of  Charles  the  First  by  a  tax  on  beer,</span><span>  and  Oliver  Cromwell,  being  a  brewer,  was  no</span><span>  doubt  excited  to  rebellion  by  this  attack  on  his</span><span>  double  X.  If  he  had  been  a  milkman,  and  there</span><span>  had  been  a  duty  on  chalk,  he  would  probably  have</span><span>  been  equally  refractory.  Among  exciseable  ar-</span><span>  ticles  we  find  soap,  which  was  felt  to  be  such  a</span><span>  grievance  that  ""  How  are  you  off  for  soap?  ""  has</span><span>  become  a  common  mode  of  salutation  among  the</span><span>  poorer  classes  of  society.  There  is  a  heavy  excise</span></p> <p><span>  duty  on  hackney  coaches,  but  the  heaviest  duty</span><span>  of  all  falls  on  the  animals  employed  in  drawing</span><span>  the  vehicles.

"<p><span>  MR.  CAUDLE'S  BREAKFAST  TALK.</span></p> <p><span>  Showing  how  Caudle,  having  lost  money  at</span></p> <p><span>  cards,  determines  to-abridge  the  house  ex-</span><span>  penses.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  I  don’t  know  how  it  is,  my  dear,  but  when  I</span><span>  remember  that  there’s  only  you  and  myself—just</span><span>  two  of  us,  and  I  eat  and  drink  next  to  nothing—</span><span>  and  when  I  see  what  other  people  do  with  half  our</span><span>  money,  I  do  think  you  might  be  a  little  more</span><span>  careful.  I’m  sure  I  spend  no  money  on  myself—</span><span>  none.  Nobody  can  be  more  watchful  of  every</span><span>  sixpence  ;  but  of  course,  a  man  can  save  but  little</span><span>  when  he  knows—or,  that  is,  when  he  fears  he</span><span>  knows—that  everything’s  going  to  waste  at  home.</span><span>  Besides,  it's  a  woman's  place—particularly  a</span><span>  woman’s  place—to  save.  Women  were  designed</span><span>  for  it.  Economy  is  one  of  the  noblest  virtues</span><span>  bound  up  with  matrimony.  There  can  be  very</span><span>  little  real  love,  Mrs.  Caudle,  where  economy’s  ne-</span><span>  glected.  A  woman  can’t  truly  care  for  a  man’s</span><span>  heart,  unless  she  has  an  equal  regard  for  his</span><span>  pocket  ;  the  things  go  together,  and  always  did</span></p> <p><span>  from  the  first.</span></p> <p><span>  ""No,  Mrs.  Caudle,  I  did  not  lose  at  my  whist</span><span>  club  last  night—that  is,  only  next  to  nothing  ;  in</span><span>  other  words,  nothing  to  speak  of.  Now,  that's</span><span>  like  your  sex.  You  always  set  about  hunting  for</span><span>  some  foolish,  shabby  motive  for  whatever  your</span><span>  husbands  complain  about.  Because  I  lose  at</span><span>  cards,  I  don’t  want  to  get  the  money  back  out  of</span><span>  the  cupboard.  No  :  I  want  to  save  money,  that,</span><span>  should  I  be  taken  from  you—and  life  at  all  times</span><span>  is  uncertain,  Mrs.  Caudle—you  might  be  left  snug</span><span>  and  comfortable—that’s  my  object.  But  I  never</span><span>  knew  any  woman  yet—except  one,  rest  her  sainted</span><span>  soul  !—who  had  the  mind  or  the  generosity  to  allow</span><span>  a  truly  noble  motive  to  what  her  husband  should</span><span>  do  ;  that  is,  if  it  went  against  herself.  You  can’t</span><span>  help  it—poor  things  !—nevertheless,  when  a  man</span><span>  is  depriving  himself  of  every  little  enjoyment  that</span><span>  he  may  lay  by  something  for  a  rainy  day,  it  is</span><span>  hard—a  little  hard,  I  think—to  have  a  woman</span></p> <p><span>  spend  what  you  do  in  housekeeping.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  Now,  Mrs.  Caudle,  be  rational  ;  and,  for  the</span><span>  thousandth  time,  let  me  beg  of  you  not  to  cry.</span><span>  You  only  waste  your  trouble  and  your  tears.  Both</span><span>  are  thrown  away  upon  me  :  I’m  not  one  of  the</span><span>  people,  I  tell  you  again,  to  be  melted  with  a  little</span><span>  soft  water.  My  expenses,  that  is,  your  expenses,</span><span>  are  dreadful.  Your  grocer’s  bill—and  when  I</span><span>  never  taste  sugar  in  my  tea—is  preposterous  ;</span><span>  enough  to  ruin  a  man  of  ten  thousand  a  year.</span><span>  What  ?  I  take  sugar  in  my  grog,  and  so  do  my</span><span>  friends  ?  Scarcely  any—nothing  to  speak  of  ;</span><span>  not  worth  naming.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  And  then  look  at  your  butcher  for  the  last</span><span>  fortnight.  Well  ?  I  know  I  won’t  eat  cold  joints.</span><span>  I  had  enough  of  them  with  my  first—that  is,  I</span><span>  can’t  bear  ’em.  Besides,  with  half  the  money  you</span><span>  have,  a  cold  joint’s  an  insult  to  any  man.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  And  finally,  Mrs.  Caudle,—for  you  know  I</span><span>  hate  this  talk  at  breakfast  ;  it’s  a  meal  of  all  others</span><span>  I  like  to  enjoy  if  I  can—finally,  I  have  made  a</span><span>  calculation,  and  in  the  next  month,  come  what  will,</span><span>  your  cupboard  must  do  with  ten  pounds  less.  It’s</span><span>  for  your  good,  I  tell  you,  when  I’m  gone,  and  ten</span><span>  pounds  I  must  have  of  you.""</span></p> <p><span>  GOING  OUT  TO  A  PARTY.—Exquisite—Aw!</span><span>  Dri-vaw  !—Have  you  a  good  horse  ?

"<p><span>  COLONIAL  ABSTRACT.</span></p> <p><span>  By  a  late  Government  Gazette,  we  observe  that</span><span>  His  Excellency  the  Governor  has  performed  an</span><span>  act  of  grace  to  the  prison  population  now  in  the</span><span>  colony.  All  former  regulations  for  granting  in-</span><span>  dulgences  have  been  rescinded,  and  the  following</span><span>  have  been  promulgated  :-  That  any  convict  who</span><span>  may  have  served  three  entire  years  without  any</span><span>  record  of  misconduct  appearing  against  him,  will</span><span>  be  eligible  for  a  ticket-of-leave  ;  that  for  three</span><span>  years  of  continued  good  conduct,  a  ticket-of-leave</span><span>  holder,  recommended  by  three  magistrates,  or</span><span>  other  persons  of  known  respectability,  will  ho</span><span>  eligible  for  a  conditional  pardon.  -  In  the  year</span><span>  1843,  New  South  Wales  imported  248,170  lbs.  of</span><span>  butter  and  cheese,  valued  at  9,497l.  In  1844,</span><span>  60,701  lbs.,  valued  at  1184l.  In  1845,  22,216</span><span>  lbs.,  valued  at  579l.  In  1843,  the  export  was</span><span>  81,173  lbs.,  valued  at  3,488.

The  saving  to  the  colony  effected</span><span>  by  the  increased  production  of  these  articles  ex-</span><span>  ceeds  13,000l.  -  The  export  of  horses  during  the</span><span>  year  1845  amounted  to  1159;  of  horned  cattle,</span><span>  3972  ;  of  sheep,  33,657  ;  valued  at  53,438l.  The</span><span>  number  of  horses  shipped  in  1844  was  489,  and</span><span>  the  total  value  of  the  Stock  exported  the  same  year</span><span>  amounted  to  40,374l.  -  In  1843,  the  value  of</span><span>  hides  and  leather  imported  into  the  colony  was</span><span>  36,185l  ;  in  1844,  19,844;  and  in  1845,  14,124l.</span><span>  In  1843,  the  export  of  the  same  articles  amounted</span><span>  to  10,305l  ;  in  1841,  to  22,285l  .;  in  1845,  to</span><span>  40,866l.

""Oh,  then,  plase  your  Lordship,""  says</span><span>  Pat,  ""sure  I  sees  Phelim  a  top  of  the  wall.</span><span>  'Paddy,'  says  he  ;  'What?'  says  I  ;  'Here,'  says</span><span>  he  ;  'Where?'  says  I  ;  'Whist!""  says  he  ;</span><span>  'Hush!'  says  I  ;  and  that's  all,  plase  your</span><span>  Lordship.</span></p> <p><span>  A  MINISTERIAL  QUARTET.  -  The  following  little</span><span>  classical  quartet  was  sung  just  before  the  tempo-</span><span>  rary  dissolution  of  the  ministry.  Lord  Stanley,</span><span>  who  took  a  part  in  the  quartet,  destroyed  the  har-</span><span>  mony,  and  ultimately  put  an  end  to  the  concert.</span><span>  He  would  not  agree  to  subdue  his  voice  sufficiently,</span><span>  or,  in  other  words,  to  sing  small,  and  he  was  con-</span><span>  sequently  kept  out  of  the  arrangements  when  the</span><span>  Ministerial  Sons  of  Harmony  met  again  for  the</span><span>  purpose  of  practising  the  new  tunes,  and  adopting</span></p> <p><span>  the  airs  and  variations  of  the  Premier.  But  we</span></p> <p><span>  are  losing  sight  of  the  quartet,  which  ran  as</span></p> <p><span>  follows  :-</span></p> <p><span>  LORD  STANLEY  (andantino).</span><span>  Corn  must  go  up,  up,  up.</span></p> <p><span>  SIR.

A  long  discussion  ensued,  which  ended</span><span>  in  the  entire  destruction  of  the  concert,  and  the</span><span>  total  sacrifice  of  harmony.

After  the  battles  of</span><span>  Moodkee  and  Ferozeshur,  in  December,  the  Sikhs</span><span>  contrived  to  detach  a  force  and  attack  and  destroy</span><span>  the  great  military  station  of  Loodihana,  in  which</span><span>  they  were  completely  successful,  as  they  plundered</span><span>  the  station  and  then  set  it  on  fire.  Major-General</span><span>  Sir  Harry  Smith  was  sent  with  six  thousand  men</span><span>  to  save  Loodihana,  but  was  too  late  ;  but  on  the</span><span>  20th  January  he  came  up  with  the  enemy,  com-</span><span>  puted  at  thirty  thousand  strong,  and  after  a  smart</span><span>  engagement,  completely  routed  them.

The  loss,  however,  was  very</span><span>  heavy,  particularly  in  officers  of  high  rank.  Col.</span><span>  Ryan  and  Captain  Tew,  of  the  50th,  were  among</span><span>  the  killed.  On  the  12th  February,  after  the</span><span>  victory,  the  British  crossed  the  Sutledge,  en  route</span><span>  to  Lahore,  and  from  that  day  the  downfall  of  the</span><span>  Punjaub  as  an  independent  state  may  be  dated.—</span><span>  Sydney  Herald.</span></p> <p><span>  Who  was  the  first  patron  of  Newspapers  ?—</span><span>  Cain  ;  he  took  A-Bel's  Life.</span></p> <p><span>  Why  are  poor  attorneys  like  rheumatic  old</span><span>  ladies  ?—Because  they  often  complain  of  their</span><span>  poor  fee-taking  (feet  aching.)</span></p> <p><span>  Why  is  a  doctor  out  of  luck  like  a  woman  out</span><span>  of  temper  ?—Because  he  has  lost  his  patients</span><span>  (patience).</span></p> <p><span>  A  HAREM  SCENE.—In  his  palace  of  Kizil-</span><span>  Ermak,  the  red  river,  Djezar  passed  the  greater</span><span>  portion  of  the  day,  extended  upon  cushions  at  the</span><span>  feet  of  his  beautiful  slave,  smoking  the  roses  of</span><span>  Taif  and  Adrianople,  mixed  with  the  tobacco  of</span><span>  Malatia  and  Latakia,  adding  occasionally  a  leaf</span><span>  of  Naschick,  a  grain  of  opium,  or  even  of  arsenic</span><span>  (?),  to  exalt  his  imagination.

What's  the  matter  ?  Matter  enough,</span><span>  I  think  !  I'm  called  out,  from  my  breakfast  too,</span><span>  and  this,  Mrs.  Caudle,  this  little  bit  of  paper  put</span><span>  into  my  hand.  What  have  you  the  face  to  ask,</span><span>  Mrs.  Caudle  ?  What  of  it  ?  Don't  1  know  I</span><span>  owe  it  ?  Why,  of  course  not  !  I  could  have  laid</span><span>  my  life  that  that  bill  was  paid  long  ago  !  I  could</span></p> <p><span>  have  sworn  it.'</span></p> <p><span>  How  was  it  to  be  paid  ?  You  ask  that  !  Why,</span><span>  with  money,  of  course.  But  1  never  gave  you</span><span>  the  money  ?  Nonsense  !  You're  enough  to  drive</span><span>  a  man  mad,  Mrs.  Caudle.  I  must  have  given  you</span><span>  the  money  ;  of  course,  I  must.  Else  where  can</span><span>  all  the  money  go  to  ?  When  did  I  give  it  ?</span><span>  Well,  if  you  are  not  the  most  outrageous,  per-</span><span>  plexing  woman  !  When  did  I  give  it,  indeed  !</span><span>  As  if,  with  what  I  have  on  my  mind,  I  can  ex-</span><span>  actly  recollect  the  day,  and  the  hour,  and  the</span><span>  place  when  I  gave  you  the  money  for  that  bill  !</span><span>  I,  who  am  always  giving  you  money  for  bills.</span><span>  Do  you  think  I'm  a  calculating  machine,  Mrs.</span><span>  Caudle-to  remember  everything,  and  with  what</span><span>  I  have  in  my  head  ?  All  I  know  is-and  that's</span><span>  enough  for  any  reasonable  man-all  I  know  is,  I</span><span>  must  have  given  you  the  money.  The  bill's  been</span><span>  delivered  a  month  ago,  the  man  told  me:  and</span><span>  you're  not  the  woman,  I  know,  to  let  me  remain</span><span>  quiet  for  a  bill  so  long.  No,  indeed  ;  for  if  there's</span><span>  anything  in  the  world  that  gives  you  pleasure,  it</span><span>  is  continually  coming  to  my  pocket.  And  you</span><span>  must  think  I've  got  a  gold  mine  there  ;  to  dip  as</span><span>  you  do  into  it.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  There  you  are  !  Crying  again  !  That's  the</span><span>  mean  advantage  you  women  always  try  to  take  of</span><span>  your  husbands.  What  !  You  wish  I'd  common</span><span>  feelings,  and  you  wish  you  were  in  your  grave?</span><span>  Of  course.  A  man  can't  open  his  mouth,  can't</span><span>  make  the  slightest  remonstrance,  when  a  woman</span><span>  let's  money  matters  go  all  wrong,  but  he  wants</span><span>  feelings.  Ha  !  He'd  better  want  a  few  feelings</span><span>  than  want  money.  And  I'm  sure,  Mrs.  Caudle,</span><span>  that's  your  opinion  if  you  spoke  the  truth.  And</span><span>  then  again,  you  must  always  be  scratching  your</span><span>  grave  up  before  me  !  And  only  because  I  just</span><span>  speak  about  a  bill.  Of  course,  you've  paid  away</span><span>  the  money  for  something  else-some  new  gowns,</span><span>  perhaps-and  forgot  it.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  However,  Mrs.  Caudle,  it's  not  worth  quar-</span><span>  relling  about-certainly  not.  Besides,  I  hate</span><span>  quarrelling.  However,  this  I  have  to  say  :  as</span><span>  I'm  convinced  that  I've  given  you  the  money  for</span><span>  the  bill  once,  I'm  not  going  to  pay  it  a  second</span><span>  time.  You  must  save  it  out  of  something  else.</span><span>  What  are  you  to  save  it  out  of?

The</span><span>  natives  ordered  Mrs.  Norton  off  with  threats,  but</span><span>  with  true  motherly  devotion,  she  refused  to  go,  not</span><span>  being  able  to  carry,  her  poor  infants  with  her.  She</span><span>  also  threw  what  little  money  she  had  on  the</span><span>  ground  before  them,  and  stood  over  the  children.</span></p> <p><span>  Even  these  savages  were  so  charmed  with  her</span></p> <p><span>  spirit  that  they  left  the  hut  without  injuring  any</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  family.—The  tender  for  2000  gallons  of</span><span>  rum,  five  per  cent,  under  proof,  for  the  Commis-</span><span>  sariat  in  Hobart  Town,  has  been  taken  by  Mr.</span><span>  Johnson,  of  the  Wharf  at  7s.  6d.  per  gallon.—</span><span>  Some  samples  of  seed-wheat  grown  at  a  farm,  on</span><span>  the  river  Plenty,  in  Port  Phillip,  readily  sold  in</span><span>  Scotland,  in  February  last,  at  from  ten  to  fifteen</span><span>  shillings  per  bushel.  Changing  seed  is  all  the</span><span>  rage  with  the  home  farmers,  and  Australian</span><span>  wheat,  at  the  above  mentioned  prices,  is  often</span><span>  and  eagerly  sought  after  in  the  market.—An</span><span>  Adelaide  paper  gives  information  that  Mr.  Pro-</span></p> <p><span>  tector  Robinson,  who  was  advertised  for  by  his</span><span>  Honor  the  Superintendent,  in  the  Port  Phillip</span><span>  Government  Gazette,  was  met,  in  company  with</span><span>  a  Mr.  Jones  and  a  Mr.  Hancock,  on  the  Adelaide</span><span>  side  of  Lake  Bonney,  and  was  expected,  to  arrive</span><span>  in  Adelaide  shortly.</span></p> <p><span>  HORSE  STUD.—A  splendid  stud-horse,  called</span><span>  ""Royal  William,  had  recently  been  imported  into</span><span>  Port  Phillip  by  a  Mr.  Tilly.  Royal  William  is</span><span>  by  Royal  Oak,  a  descendant  of  Marske,  the  sire  of</span><span>  the  celebrated  Eclipse.  His  dam  is  Princess  Royal,</span><span>  a  descendant  of  Childers.  He  was  bred  by</span><span>  Mr.  William  Edwards,  of  Newmarket,  who  re-</span><span>  fused  a  thousand  guineas  for  him  when  a  three</span><span>  year  old.</span></p> <p><span>  HONI  HEKI,  A  TIPPERARY  MAN.—An  Irish</span><span>  paper,  the  Tipperary  Vindicator,  gravely  in-</span><span>  forms  its  readers,  on  the  authority,  we  presume,</span><span>  of  some  waggish  correpondent,  that  ""  it  is  curious,</span><span>  but,  at  the  same  time,  an  undoubted  fact,  that</span><span>  Heki  is  a  Tipperary  man—a  native  of  the  town-</span><span>  land  of  Lisbony,  in  the  parish,  of  Nenagh,  where</span><span>  all  his  family  reside.  He  was  originally  a  private</span><span>  in  the  5th  Dragoon  Guards,  but  having  been</span><span>  harshly  treated,  he  deserted,  and  was  adopted</span><span>  chief  and  general  by  the  natives,  to  the  daughter</span><span>  of  whose  king  he  is  married.""  This  is  exceed-</span><span>  ingly  rich,  but,  we  must  confess—only  equalled</span><span>  by  the  observation  of  a  Port  Phillip  contemporary,</span><span>  who,  in  presenting  the  above  to  his  readers,</span><span>  commends  the  Vindicator  as  ""  a  highly  re</span><span>  spectable  journal,  able  to  throw  some  light  upon</span><span>  the  subject.""  Long  life  to  the  Tipperary  Vindi-</span><span>  cator,  say  we.  Perhaps  our  Melbourne  friend  will</span><span>  be  courteous  enough  to  inform  us,  whether  the</span><span>  5th  Dragoon  Guards  are  still  stationed  at  New</span></p> <p><span>  Zealand  ?</span></p> <p><span>  THE  PRESENT  POSITION  OF  THE  SQUATTERS.—</span><span>  On  the  30th  of  June  expires  the  Act  of  Council</span><span>  2nd  Vict.  No.  27,  together  with  the  5th  Vict.  No.</span><span>  9,  continuing  and  enlarging  the  provisions  of  the</span><span>  former.  The  refusal  of  the  Council  to  renew  these</span><span>  obnoxious  measures,  and  the  subsequent  adjourn-</span><span>  ment  and  prorogation  of  the  House,  of  necessity</span><span>  prevent  any  temporary  enactment,  touching  the</span><span>  administration  of  Crown  lands,  beyond  the  boun-</span><span>  daries  ;  and  accordingly  we  shall,  in  a  few  days,</span><span>  be  in  the  same  situation  as  respects  these  lands,</span><span>  as  that  which  we  held  before  either  of  the  above</span><span>  mentioned  enactments  became  law.  The  days  of</span><span>  Crown  Land  Commissioners  are  numbered,  and</span><span>  on  the  30th  of  the  month,  they  will  one  and  all</span><span>  breathe  their  last  official  sigh.  The  first  of  July</span><span>  will  dawn  upon  a  colony  suddenly  relieved  from</span><span>  the  pressure  of  as  offensive  and  un-English  a</span><span>  system  of  land  administration  as  could  have  well</span><span>  been  devised  by  the  most  ingeniously  despotic</span><span>  mind  ;  and  the  previous  day's  mortality  of  Crown</span><span>  Land  Commissioners  being  considered,  it  is  likely</span><span>  that  the  squatters  will  for  some  time  find  it  diffi-</span><span>  cult  to  analyze  their  sensations.  No  more  Com</span><span>  misioner  visitations,—no  more  Commissioner  im-</span><span>  poundings,—no  more  Commissioner  three-half-</span><span>  penny,  or  three-penny  assessments,  as  the  case</span><span>  may  be,-no  more  Commissioner's  distresses,  and</span><span>  sales,-no  more  Commissioner  progresses  through</span><span>  their  districts,  as  Equestrian  Courts  of  Equity,—</span><span>  no  more  basking  in  Commissioner  smiles;  or</span><span>  terror  at  Commissioner  frowns.  The  squatters</span><span>  will  doubtless  reflect  upon,  and  pass  to  the  credit</span><span>  of  their  condition,  these  important  and  interesting</span><span>  considerations  ;  but  they  will  naturally  also  en-</span><span>  quire  whether  there  are  any  and  what  other  con-</span><span>  siderations,  to  place  on  the  opposite  side  of  the</span><span>  account.  And  here  they  will  probably,  in  the</span><span>  first  instance,  think  of  the  Attorney-General,  and</span><span>  of  his  late  facetious  discourse  in  the  Legislative</span><span>  Council,  touching  writs  of  intrusion  :  and  will</span><span>  perhaps  fruitlessly  puzzle  themselves  in  the  effort</span><span>  to  understand,  how  far,  and  how  effectually,  he</span><span>  may  be  able  to  bring  his  legal  engines  to  bear</span><span>  upon  the  gentle  shepherds  beyond  the  boundaries.</span><span>  In  the  late  debate  the  Attorneys-General,  as  if—it</span><span>  appeared  to  us—to  catch  a  few  squatter  votes,</span><span>  through  squatters'  fears,  intimated  that  the  re-</span><span>  newal  of  the  Act  was  of  little  consequence  to  the</span><span>  Government,  as  compared  with  its  importance  to</span><span>  the  squatters  themselves  ;  that  the  Crown  had</span><span>  such  things  as  writs  of  intrusion,  and  writs  of</span><span>  entry,  and  an  Attorney-General  who  could  use</span><span>  them  ;  and  that  although  the  squatters,  like</span><span>  Mr.  Paul  Pry,  might,  under  the  circumstances,</span><span>  ""  hope  they  did'nt  intrude,""  they  would  in  point</span><span>  of  law  and  fact  be  all  intruders  together  ;</span><span>  and  would  perhaps  be  dealt  with  accordingly.</span><span>  Hence  a  question,  at  present  an  interesting  one—</span><span>  Are,  the  squatters  in  a  position  in  respect  to  the</span><span>  Government  rendering  them  liable,  to  be  pro-</span><span>  ceeded  against  as  for  intrusion  ?  We  appre-</span><span>  hend  not.  Intrusion,  according  to  the  legal</span><span>  authorities  of  Coke  upon  Littleton,  277,  and  Fitz</span><span>  herbert's  Natura  Brevium,  203,  204,  appears  to</span><span>  be  a  very  different  case  from  that  of  the  occu-</span><span>  pation  of  land  by  a  squatter,  after  the  expiration</span><span>  of  an  Act,  under  which  he  was  at  first  lawfully</span><span>  let  into  possession.  Intrusion  is  a  wrongful  entry</span><span>  where  the  possession  is  vacant  ..  as  where  a</span><span>  tenant  for  life  dies  seized  of  certain  lands  and</span><span>  tenements,  and  a  stranger  enters  after  the  death</span><span>  of  the  tenant,  and  before  any  entry  by  the  person</span><span>  in  remainder  or  reversion.  The.  entry  of  the</span><span>  squatter  having  been  originally  lawful,  the  ut-</span><span>  most  that  could  be  contended  would  be  that  he</span><span>  detained  after  the  expiration  of  the  period  for  which</span><span>  he  was  justified  in  holding  the  land  ;  and  this</span><span>  case  much  more  strongly  resembles  the  kind  of</span><span>  ouster  called  a  deforcement,  than  an  intrusion.</span><span>  For  intrusion,  no  doubt  the  summary  remedy  by</span><span>  a  writ  of  entry  would  lie  ;  but  for  deforcement</span><span>  the  remedy  must  be  by  action  :  and  either  course</span></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  would  not  be  a  very,  respectable  one  for  a  govern-</span><span>  ment  to  take  against  its  own  people,  if  either</span><span>  course  were  less  than  wild  and  impracticable,</span><span>  which  it  is  not.  The  army  of  bailiffs  required  to,</span><span>  be  in  possession,  in  the  different  scarcely-defined</span><span>  locations  of  an  unsurveyed  country,  was  happily</span><span>  ridiculed  by  Mr.  Lowe  in  the  course  .of  his  speech.</span><span>  In  short,  the  assault  by  Don  Quixote  upon  the</span><span>  windmills  was  not  followed  by  a  more  disastrous</span><span>  result,  than  would  attend  a  general  attack  on  the</span><span>  squatters,  by  our  legal  Quixote,  even  if  aided  by</span><span>  his  own  Sancho,  the  Civil  Crown  Solicitor.  We</span><span>  have  much  too  high  an  opinion  of  the  Attorney-</span><span>  General's  judgment,  to  believe  that  he,  would</span><span>  seriously  attempt  to  put  in  practice  a  suggestion</span><span>  that  might  be  well  enough  thrown  out,  quantum</span><span>  valeat,  in  the  course  of  a  debate.  The  squatters</span><span>  must,  we  conceive,  remain  undisturbed  until  the</span><span>  arrival  of  Mr.  Hope's  Bill,  or  until,  at  the  next</span><span>  meeting  of  the  Council,  a  measure  can  be  framed</span><span>  and  passed  for  the  regulation  of  their  interests.</span><span>  But  meanwhile,  what  will  be  their  position,  as  re-</span><span>  spects  their  rights  and  liberties,  should  they  be</span><span>  disturbed  in  their  possession  by  strangers  ?  Could</span><span>  they  turn  off  disturbers,  or  maintain  tresspass</span><span>  against  them  ?  There  is  no  doubt  they  could  do</span><span>  so,  as  effectually  as  during  the  existence  of  the</span><span>  Act  ;  the  only  difference  being,  that  there  would</span><span>  be  no  preliminary  adjudication  by  a  Crown  Land</span><span>  Commissioner,  first  to  be  obtained,  We  believe</span><span>  that  before  the  passing  of  either  of  the  Acts  men-</span><span>  tioned  at  the  beginning  of  this  article,  actions  of</span><span>  tresspass  by  squatters  against  disturbers  of  their</span><span>  possession  were  by  no  means  unfrequent,  and  ver-</span><span>  dicts  were  recovered,  upon  the  common  legal</span><span>  axiom  that  possession  alone  is  sufficient  to  support</span><span>  an  action  of  tresspass  against  a  wrong  doer.—</span><span>  Sydney  Morning  Herald.</span></p> <p><span>  CPE  OF  GOOD  HOPE.—A  private  letter  from</span><span>  the  Cape,  of  30th  April,  published  in  the  South</span><span>  Australian  Gazette,  contains  the  latest  news  yet</span><span>  received.  The  writer  says—""There  is  nothing</span><span>  else  talked  of  in  Cape  Town,  but  the  war  with  the</span><span>  Kaffirs,  and  the  dearness  of  provisions.  The</span><span>  frontier  mail  is  better  than  thirty  hours  overdue,</span><span>  and  it  is  supposed  that  the  Kaffirs  have  shot  the</span><span>  guard  and  destroyed  the  mail.  The  last  accounts</span></p> <p><span>  from  the  frontier  were,  that  our  Governor  was</span><span>  nearly  taken  prisoner,  and  that  the  Kaffirs  had</span><span>  taken  fifty  baggage  waggons,  but  not  the  am-</span><span>  munition.

Instead  of,  ""Has  your  mother</span><span>  sold  her  mangle?""  the  boys  in  the  streets  now</span><span>  ask,  ""  Has  your  father  Sold  his  theodolite  ?""</span><span>  Another  specimen  of  refinement  has  been  recently</span><span>  practised;  the  well-known  expression  of  ""He</span><span>  goes  the  whole  hog,""  has  been  changed  to  ""  He</span><span>  locomotes  the  entire  swine,""</span></p> <p><span>  A  VOICE  FROM  THE  BOURDOIR,  ON  BERLIN</span><span>  WOOL.—We  are  sure  the  ladies  of  England  are</span><span>  very  glad  to  hear  that  Sir  R.  Peel,  like  a  good</span><span>  creature,  is  going  to  take  off  the  duty,  or  tariff,</span><span>  or  whatever  it  is  called,  from  foreign  lace  and</span><span>  Leghorns,  and  French  shoes,  and  other  things</span><span>  that  they  are  always  wanting.  They  are  charmed</span><span>  with  dear  Sir  Robert-a  duck  of  a  Premier  !-  for</span><span>  not  having  all  his  mind  taken  up  with  that  Ire-</span><span>  land,  and  those  Corn  Laws,  and  the  stupid  agri-</span><span>  cultural  interest  ;  but  for  attending  a  little  to  their</span><span>  own  interest,  which  must  be  granted  to  be  the</span><span>  most  interesting  of  any.  But  there  is  one  thing</span><span>  that  he  must  do,  or  else  they  shall  not  like  him  half</span><span>  so  well  as  they  otherwise  should.  He  positively</span><span>  must  take  the  tax  off  Berlin  Wool.  They  regret  to</span><span>  learn  that  he  does  not  mean  to  repeal  this  tax,  be-</span><span>  cause  he  thinks  it  a  tax  on  luxury.  Berlin  wool</span><span>  a  luxury  !  They  never  heard  of  such  a  thing.</span><span>  The  grant  that  pine-apples  and  other  foreign  fruit</span><span>  —Champagne,  Constantia,  Noyeau,  and  wines  and</span><span>  liqueurs  of  that  kind—such  a  rarity,  for  instance,</span><span>  as  parfait  amour—are  luxuries.  They  will  ad-</span><span>  mit  that  cigars  are  luxuries,  though  they  cannot</span><span>  conceive  how;  but  they  never  will  admit  that</span><span>  Berlin  wool  can  be  viewed  in  that  light.  They</span><span>  own  that  they  make  little  elegancies  out  of  it,  but</span><span>  if  it  is  to  be  taxed  on  that  account,  they  suppose</span><span>  curl-papers  will  be  taxed  next.  Sir  Robert  should</span><span>  consider  what  a  save  it  is  in  a  family  to  have</span><span>  cushions  and  stools,  and  netting  for  chairs,  worked</span><span>  at  home.  The  ladies  hope  that  he  is  still  enough</span><span>  of  a  protectionist  to  appreciate  the  value  of  a  kettle</span><span>  holder,  marked  with  the  warning,  ""  Mind-,  it</span><span>  boils  !""  otherwise  they  will  not  be  sorry  should</span><span>  he  burn  his  fingers  for  the  want  of  one.  Things</span><span>  of  this  kind  surely,  they  maintain,  are  not  luxu-</span><span>  ries,  for  what  could  they  do  without  them  ?  So</span><span>  they  hope  Sir  Robert  Peel  will  not  be  an  obstinate</span><span>  and  a  stupid,  but  will  give  up  the  Berlin  wool  tax</span><span>  along  with  the  other  plaguy  taxes,  or  else  they</span><span>  shall  be  very  cross  with  him,  and  will  give  him  a</span><span>  good  scolding.—Punch.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  MORETON  BAY  COURIER  is  published  every</span></p> <p><span>  Saturday  morning.

"<p><span>  COLONIAL.</span></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  CAPTAIN  STOKES'S  DISCOVERIES.-In  various</span></p> <p><span>  articles  upon  the  northern  parts  of  New  Holland,</span><span>  directed  as  they  have  been,  in  part,  to  illustration</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  discoveries  of  Leichhardt,  we  have  called</span><span>  the  attention  of  our  brother  colonists  to  the  vast</span><span>  fields  for  enterprise  and  labour,  at  present  unoc-</span><span>  cupied,  which  are  merely  awaiting  the  processes</span><span>  of  occupation  and  culture  to  furnish  an  abundant</span></p> <p><span>  increase  to  our  national  wealth.  Our  inducement</span><span>  now  to  return  to  the  subject  is  twofold.  Leich-</span><span>  hardt  has  again  set  forth,  upon  his  exploration,</span><span>  and  is  already  many  miles  from  Sydney,  in  his</span><span>  progress  towards  his  new  destination  ;  and  the</span><span>  result  of  Captain  Stokes's  discoveries  has  just</span><span>  come  into  our  bands.  .As  much  that  is  contained</span><span>  in  the  works  of  the  latter  gentleman,  independent</span><span>  of  its  positive  value,  is  of  relative  use  to  us  in</span><span>  appreciating  the  energy  and  truthfulness  of  the</span><span>  former,  we  propose,  therefore,  to  examine  some  of</span><span>  the  contents  of  Captain  Stokes's  volumes.  It</span><span>  may  also  be  of  service  to  Dr.  Leichhardt,  should</span><span>  he  be  able  which  we  think  he  will,  before  he  quits</span><span>  the  settled  districts,  to  get  sight  of  our  columns,</span><span>  to  see  how  encouragingly  (as  it  were)  for  the</span><span>  future,  Captain  Stokes's  confirms  what  he  has  al-</span><span>  ready  published  respecting  that  part  of  his  route</span><span>  which  bordered  on  the  ground  investigated  by</span><span>  the  enthusiastic  commander  of  the  Beagle.  In</span><span>  order  to  carry  out  our  views,  we  shall  not  observe</span><span>  any  consecutive  order  in  our  notice  of  the  work</span><span>  before  us,  but  refer  at  once  to  such  portions  of  it</span><span>  as  bear  on  the  subject  of  our  anxieties.  The  first</span><span>  fact  deserving  of  our  notice  is,  to  use  Captain</span><span>  Stokes's  words,  that  either  in  the  Percy  Islands</span><span>  or  in  the  Nothumberland  Islands  (lat.  21*  S.,</span><span>  not  more  than  360  miles  due  north  of  Moreton</span><span>  Bay.)  ""  sandal  wood  has  been  found  of  late  and</span><span>  taken  by  a  Tasmanian  vessel  to  the  China  market.""</span><span>  If  this  be  the  case,  we  have  a  valuable  article  of</span><span>  commerce  much  more  easily  accessible  than  was</span><span>  supposed.  It  has  been  suggested  that  the  river</span><span>  Burdekin,  which,  by  its  continuation  into  the</span><span>  Clarke,  must  drain  the  water  of  the  Carpentaria</span><span>  ranges,  disembogues  somewhere  near  Halifax  Bay  ;</span><span>  and  the  officers  of  H.M.S.  Fly  spoke  often  of  a</span><span>  river  entering  the  ocean  close  to  Cape  Upstart,</span><span>  and  but  a  few  miles  to  the  southward  of  the  Bay.</span><span>  As  this  is  a  point  of  some  importance,  we  will</span><span>  quote  Captain  Stokes's  words-""  On  sweeping  the</span><span>  western  shore  with  a  spyglass,  I  discovered  the</span><span>  mouth  of  a  river  about  a  mile  to  the  north  of  a</span><span>  hillock  marked  in  Captain  King's  chart.  This</span><span>  river  was  made  the  object  of  an  exploring  party,</span><span>  and  next  day,  Captain  Wickham  and  Lieutenant</span><span>  Eden  went  on  that  interesting  service.  It  has</span><span>  two  entrances,  both  very  shallow,  and  is  of  little</span><span>  importance,  being  on  a  lee-shore  and  fronted  by</span><span>  a  bar,  which  seems  to  break  at  all  times  of</span><span>  the  tide.  However,  as  there  is  such  very  safe</span><span>  anchorage  near,  the  discovery  may  hereafter  prove</span><span>  of  some  value.  Captain  Wickham  found  it  fresh</span><span>  ten  miles  from  the  entrance  ;  but  at  that  point  it</span><span>  is  nearly  lost  in  the  sands,  and  so  very  shallow</span><span>  that  the  natives  have  a  fishing  weir  across  it</span><span>  The  land,  which  appears  to  be  much  cut  up  with</span><span>  creeks,  is  very  flat  on  both  sides,  and  is  subject</span><span>  to  inundations.  This  was  evident  from  the  signs</span><span>  of  drift,  to  the  height  of  six  feet,  on  the  trees  that</span><span>  grew  along  the  banks,  themselves  not  more  than</span><span>  a  couple  of  yards  above  high  water  mark.""  (Vol.</span><span>  1,  p.  330.)  Of  Halifax  Bay,  the  author  says  but</span><span>  little.  But  he  sums  up  what  he  has  to  say  in  very</span><span>  significant  terms.  ""  It  is  the  general  opinion  of</span><span>  every  voyager  who  has  sailed  along  the  coast  of</span><span>  Halifax  Bay,  that  it  is  the  most  interesting  portion</span><span>  of  the  north-east  side  of  the  continent,  as  com-</span><span>  bining  the  several  facts  we  have  given.""  [These</span><span>  are  the  picturesque  character  of  the  mountainous</span><span>  termination  of  the  Cordillera,  as  the  dividing</span><span>  ranges  are  now  called,  the  signs  of  abundant</span><span>  native  population,  &c]  ""  We  have  every  reason</span><span>  to  believe  that  the  discovery  of  fertile,  and  there-</span><span>  fore  valuable,  land  will  one  day  reward  the  labours</span><span>  of  the  explorer.""  It  is  to  Halifax  Bay  that  we</span><span>  have  always  pointed  as  the  centre  of  location  of</span><span>  a  new  colony,  as  being  fairly  within  the  tropic,</span><span>  commanding  the  quiet  waters  inside  the  Great</span><span>  Barrier,  and  so  well  situated  with  respect  to  the</span><span>  York  Peninsula,  the  Gulf  of  Carpentaria,  and</span><span>  the  splendid  country  discovered  by  Leichhardt  to</span><span>  the  southward  of  the  Burdekin.  Our  impression</span><span>  is  so  strong  on  this  point,  that  we  would  venture</span><span>  to  suggest  that  the  Legislative  Council  should</span><span>  take  up  the  subject,  appoint  a  committee  to  enquire</span><span>  and  report,  and  then  petition  the  Home  Govern-</span><span>  ment  to  colonise  that  interesting  district.  It  was</span><span>  not  far  from  Halifax  Bay,  in  lat.  19*  54',  that</span><span>  Leichhardt  found  a  fine  limestone  ;  and  his  ge-</span><span>  neral  account  of  the  country  westward  of  the</span><span>  coast  confirms  all  our  conjectures  as  to  its  avail-</span><span>  able  character.  As  we  have  no  alternative,  we</span><span>  must  now  pass  at  once  to  the  country  bounding</span><span>  the  Gulf  of  Carpentaria,  where  many  important</span><span>  discoveries  were  made  by  Captain  Stokes.  This</span><span>  author  remarks,  as  Leichhardt  has  done,  on  the</span><span>  abundance  of  rivers  and  creeks  which  flow  into</span></p> <p><span>  the  Gulf  ;  on  the  fineness  of  the  country  for</span><span>  grazing  purposes  ;  on  the  abundance  of  wild  fowl</span><span>  and  birds  of  all  kinds,  and  on  the  peculiarities  of</span><span>  temperature,  and  of  the  coolness  of  the  wind.</span><span>  Amongst  the  rivers  mentioned  by  Leichhardt  is</span><span>  the  Yappar,  which  he  afterwards  considered  as  the</span><span>  Flinders  of  Captain  Stokes.  He  made  it  in  lat.</span><span>  17*  49',  where  it  was  salt  ;  and  he  gives  the  long.</span><span>  140*  45'  E.  Captain  Stokes  lays  down  the  Flin-</span><span>  ders  in  lat.  17*  36'  to  17'  52',  and  in  long.  140*</span><span>  40'.  Leichhardt,  therefore,  passed  the  Flinders</span><span>  near  the  spot  where  Stokes  ceased  his  exploration.</span><span>  As  Captain  Stokes  ascended  the  river  thus  far  in</span><span>  a  boat,  the  natives,  one  of  whose  dead  was  found</span><span>  by  him  laid  out  in  a  tree,  must  have  been  ac-</span><span>  quainted  with  Europeans  ;  and  we  find  Leichhardt</span><span>  in  his  report  stating,  ""  the  country  is  well  in-</span><span>  habited  by  blackfellows  ;  we  had  three  times  in-</span><span>  tercourse  with  them-the  third  time  (at  the  Yap</span><span>  par)  they  were  friendly,  and  it  was  evident  they</span><span>  had  seen  either  Malays  or  white  men  before</span><span>  us.""  As  Leichhardt  could  not  follow  down  to</span><span>  their  mouths  any  of  the  rivers  he  crossed,  and  it</span><span>  may  be  interesting  to  our  readers  to  know  what</span><span>  is  the  nature  of  those  rivers,  we  will  borrow  an</span><span>  account  of  the  Flinders  or  Yappar  from  Stokes.</span><span>  He  places  its  mouth  in  lat.  17*  36'  40""  S.,  and</span><span>  long.  8*  27'  E.  of  Port  Essington.  A  channel</span><span>  of  two  feet  through  the  flat  at  low  water,  marks</span><span>  the  entrance:  The  river  has  near  its  entrance  a</span><span>  depth  of  from  three  to  five  fathoms,  with  a  breadth</span><span>  of  about  one  hundred  and  twenty  yards,  and  is</span><span>  well  marked  from  the  offing  by  abundance  of</span><span>  trees  dotted  on  the  low  grounds.  The  tides  occur</span><span>  only  once  in  twenty-four  hours,  a  phenomenon</span><span>  common  to  the  Gulf.

Numerous  banks  impeded  the  course</span><span>  and  reduced  the  depth  ;  plains  dotted  with  trees</span><span>  or  dense  jungle,  filled  with  vampyres  (Qy.,  ""  fly-</span><span>  ing  foxes?""  one  of  Leichhardts  dainties,)  and</span><span>  whistling  ducks,  alternated  beyond  the  water's  edge.</span><span>  About  twelve  miles  from  the  mouth  sunken  trees</span><span>  were  numerous,  indicating  ""  how  fierce  a  torrent</span><span>  had  borne  them  thither.""  Fine  sheets  of  limpid</span><span>  water,  low  grassy  islets,  native  shrubberies,  and</span><span>  sandy  beaches,  with  grassy  banks  sloping  into</span><span>  the  stream,  and  masses  of  luxuriant  creepers,  were</span><span>  the  general  features.  An  engraving  represents</span><span>  a  beautiful  scene  at  the  spot  where  the  dead  body</span><span>  was  found.  The  ground  here  was  higher  than,  the</span><span>  country  in  general,  perhaps  thirty-five  feet  in</span><span>  elevation  above  the  sea  ;  the  plains  were  covered</span><span>  with  rose-coloured  cockatoos.  Beyond  Burial</span><span>  Reach  the  river  bifurcates,  one  branch  tending</span><span>  easterly.  The  furthest  position  was  thirty  miles</span><span>  from  the  entrance,  in  lat.  17*  51',  or  just  two  miles</span><span>  above  where  Leichhardt  crossed  one  of  the</span><span>  branches.  Abundance  of  smoke  and  fire  marked</span><span>  the  presence  of  natives.  It  is  really  delightful  to</span><span>  see  how  accurately  Captain  Stoke's  account  tallies</span><span>  with  that  of  our  enterprising  friend,  now  again  on</span><span>  the  wide  ocean  of  adventure.  In  our  farther</span><span>  notices  of  the  work  before  us,  we  shall  have  other</span><span>  examples  of  his  fidelity  to  record,  and  we  are  sure</span><span>  it  will  be  gratifying  to  his  friends  throughout  the</span><span>  colony  to  know  that  though  his  means  were  limited;</span><span>  he  was  enabled  to  make  observations  which  have</span><span>  been  confirmed  by  an  eminent  nautical  surveyor,</span><span>  and  that  his  accounts  of  the  country,  are  by  no</span><span>  means  exaggerated.  These  facts,  in  themselves</span><span>  valuable,  have  a  further  value,.  They  justify  the</span><span>  claim  for  strict  regard  to  truth,  which  Leichhardt's</span><span>  character  has  established  with  those  who  know</span><span>  him,  and  will  be  the  best  guarantee  of  his  reputa-</span><span>  tion  against  all  questioners.  In  his  report  he</span><span>  mentions  that  he  passed  between  the  Yappar</span><span>  (Flinders),  140*  45'  E.  approx.,  and  the  Nichol-</span><span>  son,  138*  55'  E.,  which  river  he  crossed  in  138*</span><span>  55'  E.,  -""  three  big  salt  water  rivers,  one  fine</span><span>  running  creek,  which  I  called  Beames's  Brook,</span><span>  and  several  chains  of  fresh  water  lagoons.""  It</span><span>  was  a  subject  of  some  surprise,  when  we  first  read</span><span>  Leichhardt's  account,  that  we  found  no  mention</span><span>  of  the  Albert  River,  the  discovery  of  which  by</span><span>  Stokes  made  some  noise  at  the  time,  as  it  was  said</span><span>  to  have  led  him  to  within  400  miles  of  the  centre</span><span>  of  the  continent.  On  comparing  his  map  with</span><span>  our  friend's  journal,  we  find  apparently  the  great-</span><span>  est  accuracy  ;  and  there  is  no  doubt  that  Beames's</span><span>  Brook  of  Leichhardt  is  the  head  of  one  branch  of</span><span>  the  Albert  of  Stokes  ;  and  this  fact  shows  the</span><span>  extreme  skill  and  judgment  with  which  that  in-</span><span>  trepid  traveller  calculated  his  distances.  Although</span><span>  we  cannot  now  allude  to  the  Albert  further,  yet  we</span><span>  cannot  resist  comparing  the  statements  of  these</span><span>  two  explorers.  Beames's  Brook  was  crossed  by</span><span>  Leichhardt  in  17*  57'  S.,  where  it  was,  he  says,</span><span>  ""  twenty  yards  broad;  its  water  was  fresh,  but</span><span>  affected  by  the  tide.  At  the  crossing  place,  (about</span><span>  eight  miles  lower  down),  it  was  three  yards  broad,</span><span>  very  deep  in  some  places,  shallow  in  others,  A  full</span><span>  flowing  little  stream,  with  magnificent  oak  trees,</span><span>  and  palms,  and  pandanus,  and  flooded  gum  along</span><span>  its  banks.  We  never  had  met,  nor  did  we  meet</span><span>  another  brook  like  it  again.""  ""  Holding,""  says</span><span>  Stokes,  speaking  of  the  Albert,  ""  our  west  course,</span><span>  we  made  the  river  again  at  the  end  of  another</span><span>  mile.  Its  size  was  reduced  to  a,  mere  rivulet,</span><span>  being  scarcely  fifteen  yards  wide,  with  a  depth</span><span>  of  five  feet.  Yet  it  had  a  greater  velocity  than</span><span>  we  had  before  observed,  running  at  the  rate  of  a</span><span>  mile  an  hour,  a  clear  babbling  brook,  over  which</span><span>  acacias  and  drooping  gums  formed  a  leafy  tunnel  ;</span><span>  its  course  was  still  from  the  south.""  ""  My</span><span>  position  was  in  lat.  17*  58  1/2'  S.,  and  long.  139.</span><span>  25  E.  Consequently,  Leichhardt  crossed  the</span><span>  Albert  about  one  and  a  half  mile  distant  from</span><span>  Stokes's  furthest  point,  just  as  he  had  crossed  the</span><span>  Flinders  in  the  same  manner.  The  ""  three  big</span><span>  salt  water  rivers""  seem  not  to  be  so  clearly  made</span><span>  out  in  the  chart  of  the  southern  part  of  the  gulph  ;</span><span>  but  Disaster  Inlet,  Morning  Inlet,  and  the  salt</span><span>  water  arm  of  the  Albert  to  the  eastward,  may  be</span><span>  the  three  sites  of  Leichhardt's  rivers.  If  this</span><span>  arrangement  be  correct,  then  the  river  Nicholson</span><span>  must  disembogue  at  Pascoe's  Inlet.  Leichhardt</span><span>  gives  the  breadth  of  the  salt  water  rivers  as  150,</span><span>  200,  and  300  yards.  Now  Stokes  says  the  Albeit</span><span>  varied  in  breadth  from  200  to  250  yards  ;  an  ac-</span><span>  cidental  testimony  of  another  kind  to  Leichhardt's</span><span>  general  accuracy.

I  cannot,  however,  recommend  the</span><span>  raising  of  a  loan  unless  it  be  guaranteed  by  her</span><span>  Majesty's  Government;  nor  can  I  recommend</span><span>  her  Majesty's  Government  to  guarantee  it,  unless</span><span>  a  full  and  efficient  Parliamentary  guarantee  be</span><span>  previously  given,  that  the  lands  of  the  colony  shall</span><span>  not  be  kept  in  perpetuity  by  those  who  may  be  the</span><span>  first  to  seize  on  them,  (!!!)  and  that  for  the  use</span><span>  of  the  unsold  lands  of  the  Crown,  a  moderate</span><span>  annual  payment  shall  be  made.</span></p> <p><span>  1  also  feel  it  necessary  to  state,  that,  without</span><span>  attempting  to  controvert  or  refute  the  general</span></p> <p><span>  nature  of  the  evidence  taken  by  the  Committee.  I</span><span>  can  scarcely  join  in  recommending  so  extensive</span><span>  an  immigration  as  that  mentioned  in  the  address.</span><span>  With  the  consequences,  indeed,  fresh  in  my</span><span>  memory,  which  resulted  from  my  having  yielded</span><span>  too  readily  in  the  years  1839  and  1840  to  the</span><span>  pressure  which  was  then  brought  to  bear  upon  me</span><span>  in  respect  to  immigration,  I  feel  it  necessary  to</span><span>  guard  myself  by  saying,  that  I  cannot  advise  the</span><span>  adoption  of  any  immediate  measures  for  the  re-</span><span>  sumption  of  immigration,  to  an  extent  greater</span><span>  than  about  one-third  of  what  is  mentioned  by  the</span><span>  Committee,  or  that  the  expense  (to  be  borne  by  the</span><span>  colony)  should  exceed  about  £75,000  per  annum.</span></p> <p><span>  I  have,  &c.,</span></p> <p><span>  (Signed)  GEO.  GIPPS.</span></p> <p><span>  NEW  ZEALAND.</span></p> <p><span>  A  number  of  armed  natives,  belonging  to  dif-</span><span>  ferent  tribes,  chiefly  from  the  interior,  to  the</span><span>  number  of  from  one  hundred  to  one  hundred  and</span><span>  fifty,  have  visited  Wanganui  under  Nopera  and</span><span>  Maketu,  two  chiefs  of  that  district,  who  were  acting</span><span>  with  Rangihaeata  during  the  late  rebellion.  The</span><span>  settlers,  who  were  in  no  condition  to  defend  them-</span><span>  selves  from  this  invasion,  fully  expected  that  their</span><span>  property,  and  perhaps  their  lives,  would  be  sacri-</span><span>  ficed  to  the  wanton  violence  of  these  savages,  and</span><span>  they  were  probably  only  saved  from  all  the  hor-</span></p> <p><span>  rors  which  would  have  resulted  from  the  unchecked</span></p> <p><span>  gratification  of  the  inflamed  passions  of  these</span><span>  marauders,  by  the  timely  and  efficient  aid  of  the</span><span>  missionary  natives  of  Putiki,  who  firmly  resisted</span><span>  any  attempt  at  violence,  and  declared  their  inten-</span><span>  tion  of  assisting  the  settlers  to  the  utmost  in  the</span><span>  event  of  any  decided  act  of  hostility  on  the  part  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  taua  towards  them.  A  report  prevailed  at  one</span><span>  time,  that  the  steamer  would  arrive  with  troops</span><span>  for  the  protection  of  the  settlers,  on  which  a  party</span><span>  of  the  taua  posted  themselves  in  ambush  in  the</span><span>  fern  near  the  mouth  of  the  river,  with  the  intention</span><span>  of  cutting  off  any  reinforcements  which  might  at-</span><span>  tempt  to  proceed  in  boats  to  the  assistance  of  the</span><span>  settlers.  After  remaining  some  days  in  the  settle-</span><span>  ment,  during  which  they  threatened  all  sorts  of</span><span>  violence,  which  it  required  the  greatest  prudence  and</span><span>  caution  on  the  part  of  the  settlers  to  prevent  from</span><span>  being  carried  into  effect,  the  taua  dispersed  on  the</span><span>  26th  instant  (October),  part  of  them  joining  Ran-</span><span>  gihaeata,  while  the  greater  number  proceeded  up</span><span>  the  river  in  their  canoes.  On  their  departure,</span><span>  they  threatened  to  return  in  great  numbers  in  two</span><span>  months'  time,  and  warned  the  settlers  in  the  inter-</span><span>  val  to  leave  the  settlement.  A  public  meeting  of</span><span>  the  settlers  was  held,  at  which  many  of  the  Putiki</span><span>  chiefs  were  present,  and  a  memorial  to  the  Go-</span><span>  vernor  was  adopted,  praying  for  efficient  protec-</span><span>  tion.

No  objection  had  ever  been  raised</span><span>  to  that  scheme,  and  the  arrangements  connected</span><span>  with  it  had  been  carried  through  to  a  great  extent  :</span><span>  as  to  the  description  of  the  settlement,  it  was  not</span><span>  quite  such  as  his  noble  friend  stated.  It  was  to</span></p> <p><span>  be  a  new  colony  to  the  north  of  the  settlements  in</span><span>  New  South  Wales,  and  it  was  not  necessarily  to</span><span>  consist  of  emancipated  convicts.  Those  persons</span><span>  who  had  gone  through  their  punishments  in  Van</span><span>  Diemen's  Land  were  certainly  to  have  facilities</span><span>  given  to  them  to  proceed  to  that  settlement  ;  but</span></p> <p><span>  it  was  also  intended  to  give  facilities  to  the  poorer,</span><span>  classes  of  this  country  who  wished  to  proceed</span></p> <p><span>  thither.</span></p> <p><span>  NEW  ZEALAND.</span></p> <p><span>  The  latest  accounts  from  New  Zealand  state  that</span><span>  the  rebels  have  at  last  met  with  a  severe  check.</span><span>  Sixteen  chiefs  have  been  taken  prisoners,  and  are</span><span>  at  present  in  safe  keeping  on  board  H.  M.  S.</span><span>  Calliope.  Everything  had  assumed  a  most  satis-</span><span>  factory  aspect,  and  a  line  of  posts  had  been  com-</span><span>  pleted  at  Porirua,  so  as  to  effectually  prevent  any</span><span>  return  of  the  rebels  to  the  district  of  the  Hutt.</span><span>  Everything  was  quiet  in  the  north.</span></p> <p><span>  RESERVATIONS  IN  GRANTS  OF  LAND.</span></p> <p><span>  South  Australia  was  colonised  with  the  distinct</span><span>  understanding,  and,  to  the  best  of  our  recollection,</span><span>  with  a  distinct  pledge  on  the  part  of  the  Home</span><span>  Government,  that  its  waste  lands  should  he  con-</span><span>  veyed  to  purchasers  in  the  completest  and  most</span><span>  absolute  form  in  which  a  freehold  could  be  created,</span><span>  including  not  only  the  surface  of  the  earth,  but</span><span>  all  above  and  all  below  it.  After  the  lapse  of</span><span>  about  ten  years,  however,  when  private  enterprise</span><span>  has  discovered  the  existence  of  mineral  treasures,</span><span>  the  Crown  invidiously  steps  in  with  its  claims  to</span><span>  a  royalty  of  minerals  dug  up,  and  with  its  re-</span><span>  servation  of  such  as  are  still  dormant  in  thier</span><span>  native  beds.</span></p> <p><span>  And  so  in  New  South  Wales,  the  Government</span></p> <p><span>  began  to  grant  in  the  spirit  of  liberality,  and</span><span>  eventually  fell  under  the  spell  of  avarice.  On</span><span>  looking  back  to  the  time,  now  two-and-twenty</span><span>  years  ago,  when  the  practice  of  selling  out  waste</span><span>  lands  was  first  introduced,  we  find  no  mention</span><span>  whatever  of  reservations  of  any  kind.  The  ear-</span><span>  liest  code  of  land  regulations,  dated  Colonial</span><span>  office,  Downing-street,  November,  1824,  contains</span><span>  this  clause  :—'  On  payment  of  the  money,  a  grant</span><span>  will  be  made  in  fee-simple  to  the  purchaser,  at  the</span><span>  nominal  quit-rent  of  a  pepper-corn.'  The  same</span><span>  stipulation  is  repeated  in  the  code  of  1825,  and</span><span>  several  subsequent  years.  Indeed,  we  can  dis-</span><span>  cover  no  trace  of  reservation  in  lands  disposed  of</span><span>  by  sale,  prior  to  the  1st  of  July,  1831,  when  the</span><span>  system  of  grants  without  purchase  was  abolished.</span><span>  In  the  regulations  of  that  date  there  is  the  follow-</span><span>  ing  clause  :—'  The  Crown  reserves  to  itself  the</span><span>  right  of  making  and  constructing  such  roads</span><span>  and  bridges  as  may  be  necessary  for  public  pur-</span><span>  poses,  in  all  lands  purchased  as  above  ;  and  also</span><span>  to  all  indigenous  timber,  stone,  and  other  mate-</span><span>  rials,  the  produce  of  the  land,  as  may  be  required</span><span>  for  making  and  keeping  the  said  roads  and  bridges</span><span>  in  repair,  and  for  any  other  public  works.  The</span><span>  Crown  further  reserves  to  itself  all  mines  of</span><span>  precious  metals  and  coals.'  In  a  subsequent</span><span>  edition  of  these  regulations,  two  additional  reser-</span><span>  vations  are  introduced  ;  namely—'  all  lands  within</span><span>  one  hundred  feet  of  high  water  mark  on  the  sea</span><span>  coast,  creeks,  harbours,  and  inlets  ;'  and  also  the</span></p> <p><span>  right  of  taking  and  removing  such  indigenous</span><span>  timber  and  other  materials,  the  produce  of  the</span><span>  land,  as  may  be  required  at  any  time  for  naval</span><span>  purposes.'</span></p> <p><span>  The  whole  of  these  very  large  and  formidable</span><span>  reservations  continue,  we  believe,  to  be  inserted  in</span><span>  deeds  of  grant  to  the  present  day.  They  are  not</span><span>  expressly  authorised  by  the  Land  Act,  5  and  6</span><span>  Victoria,  cap.  36  ;  but  whether  they  are  so  by</span><span>  implication,  we  are  not  learned  enough  to  hazard</span><span>  an  opinion.  The  measure  of  discretion  vested  in</span><span>  the  Government  by  the  5th  section  of  that  statute,</span><span>  as  to  the  terms  of  conveyance,  is  defined  thus  :</span><span>  '  Which  conveyances  or  alienations  shall  be  made</span><span>  in  such  forms  and  with  such  solemnities  as</span><span>  shall  from  time  to  time  be  prescribed  by  Her</span><span>  Majesty.'  Whether  the  power  to  prescribe  'forms</span><span>  and  solemnities'  can  or  cannot  be  legally  construed</span><span>  to  include  the  power  of  making  the  above  men-</span><span>  tioned  reservations,  is  a  question  which  we  should</span><span>  like  to  see  discussed  by  some  of  our  correspondents</span><span>  '  learned  in  the  law.'  It  would  be  a  fine  discovery</span><span>  to  find  that  all  such  reservations,  in  deeds  executed</span><span>  since  the  year  1842,  are  of,  non-effect  !—Sydney</span><span>  Morning  Herald,  September  21.</span></p> <p><span>  SWAN  RIVER.  —It  must  be  known  to  some  of</span><span>  our  commercial  fellow-colonists  that  the  Dutch</span><span>  government  employs  a  national  steamer  for  the</span><span>  conveyance  of  overland  and  ordinary  mails  and</span><span>  passengers  from  Batavia,  in  the  island  of  Java,</span><span>  to  and  from  Singapore.

During  their  absence  some  blacks  came</span><span>  to  the  dray  and  asked  for  meat,  which  was  given</span><span>  them  ;  they  went  away,  and  soon  returned  and</span><span>  asked  for  more,  which  being  refused  by  the  son-</span><span>  in-law  of  the  owner,  one  of  the  blacks  threw  a</span><span>  spear  which  pierced  his  heart  ;  the  other  instantly</span><span>  fled,  and  the  blacks  plundered  the  dray.  The</span><span>  cattle  of  course  escaped.  On  the  return  of  the</span><span>  old  man  he  found  the  empty  dray  and  a  dog</span><span>  remaining  by  it,  which  appearing  desirous  of</span><span>  drawing  him  into  the  scrub,  he  followed,  and  the</span><span>  animal  began  to  scratch  at  a  heap  of  bushes,</span><span>  under  which  he  found  the  body  of  his  son-in-law.</span><span>  These  persons  travelled  for  a  long  way  without</span><span>  provisions,  till  relieved  when  almost  starving  at</span><span>  one  of  the  Murray  stations.

There  is  even  the  chance  of</span><span>  increased  difficulties,  as  we  take  four  different</span><span>  kinds  of  animals,  goats,  bullocks,  horses,  and</span><span>  mules,  every  one  of  which  has  its  peculiar  habits</span><span>  and  requires  attention.  l  am,  moreover,  not  in-</span><span>  clined  to  take  a  large  provision  of  flour,  having</span><span>  found,  during  my  last  journey,  that  an  entirely</span><span>  animal  food  agreed  well  with  our  constitutions,</span><span>  though  there  was  of  course  a  constant  longing  for</span><span>  bread  or  damper.  I  shall  also  take  very  little</span><span>  sugar,  in  order  to  save  room  for  more  valuable</span><span>  articles.  You  have,  therefore,  to  expect  nothing</span><span>  but  tea  and  meat  for  the  greatest  part  of  the  jour-</span><span>  ney,  and  you  have  to  examine  yourself  well,</span><span>  whether  you  will  be  able  to  bear  such  a  privation</span><span>  cheerfully.

"<p><span>  QUALITY,  COMPOSITION,  AND  PRESER-</span></p> <p><span>  VATION  OF  BUTTER.</span></p> <p><span>  (  From  Johnston's  Elements  of  Agricultural</span></p> <p><span>  Chemistry,)</span></p> <p><span>  1.  The  quality  of  butter  varies  with  numerous</span><span>  circumstances.  The  kind  of  natural  pasture  or  of</span><span>  artificial  food  upon  which  the  cow  is  fed,  the</span><span>  season  of  the  year,  the  breed  and  individual  con-</span><span>  stitution  of  the  animal,  all  affect  the  quality  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  butter.</span></p> <p><span>  But  from  the  same  cow  fed  on  the  same  food,  a</span><span>  richer  butter  and  a  finer  and  higher  flavour  will  be</span><span>  obtained  by  churning  the  last  drawn  portions  of</span><span>  the  milk.  So  the  first  cream  that  rises  gives  the</span><span>  finest  flavoured  butter,-while  any  cream  or  milk</span><span>  will  give  a  butter  of  better  quality  if  it  be  properly</span><span>  soured  before  it  is  churned,  and  be  then  churned</span><span>  slowly  and  at  a  low  temperature.</span></p> <p><span>  2.  The  Composition  of  Butter.-Butter,  as  it</span><span>  usually  brought  to  the  market,  contains  more  or</span><span>  less  of  all  the  ingredients  of  milk.  It  consists,</span><span>  however,  essentially  of  the  fat  of  milk  intimately</span><span>  mixed  with  about  one-sixth  of  its  weight  of  water,</span><span>  and  a  small  quantity  of  casein,  of  saline  matter,</span><span>  and  of  the  sugar  of  milk.  The  quantity  of  casein,</span><span>  cheesy  matter,  or  curd,  seldom  amounts  to  one  per</span><span>  cent,  of  the  whole  weight  of  the  butter.</span></p> <p><span>  If  the  butter  be  melted  in  hot  water  several</span><span>  times,  shaken  with  renewed  portions  of  water  as</span><span>  long  as  they  become  milky,  and  left  then  to  repose,</span><span>  it  will  collect  on  the  surface  in  the  form  of  a  fluid</span></p> <p><span>  yellow  oil,  which  will  concrete  or  harden  as  it</span><span>  cools.  If  when  cold  it  be  put  into  a  linen  bag,</span><span>  and  be  submitted  to  strong  pressure  in  a  hydraulic</span><span>  or  other  press,  at  the  temperature  of  60*  F.,  a</span><span>  slightly  yellow  transparent  oil  will  flow  out,  and  a</span><span>  solid  white  fat  will  remain  behind  in  the  linen</span></p> <p><span>  cloth.  The  solid  fat  is  known  by  the  name  of</span><span>  margarine,  and  is  identical  with  the  solid  fat  of</span><span>  the  human  body,  with  that  of  the  goose,  and  with</span><span>  that  which  causes  the  thickness  of  olive  oil  when</span><span>  exposed  to  the  cold.  It  is  very  similar  also  to  the</span><span>  solid  fat  of  palm  oil.  The  liquid,  or  butter  oil,  is</span><span>  a  peculiar  kind  of  fat  not  hitherto  discovered  in</span><span>  any  other  substance.</span></p> <p><span>  The  proportion  of  these  two  kinds  of  fat  in  butter</span><span>  varies  very  much,  and  hence  the  different  degrees</span><span>  of  hardness  which  different  samples  of  butter  pre-</span><span>  sent.  The  solid  fat  is  said  to  abound  more  in</span><span>  winter,  the  liquid  fat  in  summer.  A  winter  and</span><span>  summer  butter  manufactured  in  the  Vosges,  were</span><span>  found  to  contain  per  cent,  respectively  of</span></p> <p><span>  Summer.  Winter.</span><span>  Solid  fat  or  margarine.  40  65</span><span>  Liquid  fat  or  butter  oil.  60  35</span></p> <p><span>  100  100</span></p> <p><span>  These  proportions,  however,  will  be  found  to</span><span>  vary  more  or  less  in  almost  every  sample  of  butter</span></p> <p><span>  we  examine.</span></p> <p><span>  3.  The  Preservation  of  Butter.-Fresh  butter</span><span>  cannot  be  kept  for  any  length  of  time  without  be-</span><span>  coming  rancid.  The  fats  themselves  undergo  a</span><span>  change,  and  the  same  is  the  case  with  the  small</span><span>  quantity  of  milk  sugar  which  the  butter  contains.</span><span>  The  main  cause  of  this  change  is  the  casein  or</span><span>  curd  which  is  usually  left  in  the  butter.  The  pro-</span></p> <p><span>  portion  of  this  cheesy  matter  I  have  found  in  two</span><span>  samples  of  fresh  butter  to  vary  from  one-half  to</span><span>  three-fourths  of  a  per  cent.,  or  from  half  a  pound  to</span><span>  three-quarters  of  a  pound  in  100  pounds  of  butter,</span><span>  and  yet  this  small  quantity  is  sufficient,  if  the,</span><span>  butter  be  exposed  to  the  air,  to  induce  these  chemi-</span><span>  cal  decompositions  to  which  the  disagreeable  smell</span></p> <p><span>  and  taste  of  rancid  butter  are  owing.</span></p> <p><span>  I  do  not  enter  here  into  the  theory  of  the  action</span><span>  of  this  casein,  nor  into  any  explanation  of  the</span><span>  nature  of  the  chemical  changes  themselves.  It  is</span><span>  sufficient  to  state,  that  this  evil  action  of  the  cheesy</span><span>  matter  may  be  entirely  prevented.</span></p> <p><span>  a.  By  salting  immediately  after  the  butter  is</span><span>  made,  and  before  the  cheesy  matter  has  had  time</span><span>  to  become  altered  by  exposure  to  the  air.</span></p> <p><span>  b.  By  taking  care  that  any  water  which  may</span><span>  remain  in  or  around  the  butter  be  always  kept  per-</span><span>  fectly  saturated  with  salt.</span></p> <p><span>  c.  By  carefully  excluding  the  air  from  the</span><span>  casks  or  other  vessels  in  which  the  butter  is</span><span>  packed.</span></p> <p><span>  So  long  as  the  cheesy  matter  is  kept  from  the</span><span>  air,  and  in  a  saturated  solution  of  salt,  it  will</span><span>  neither  undergo  and  rapid  alteration  itself,  nor</span><span>  will  it  soon  induce  any  offensive  alteration  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  butter.</span></p> <p><span>  About  half  a  pound  of  salt  is  used  to  12  or  14</span><span>  lbs.  of  butter,  and  though  many  wash  their  butter,</span><span>  it  is  a  rule  with  others  never  to  wash  it  or  dip  it</span><span>  into  water  when  intended  to  be  salted,  but  to</span><span>  work  it  with  cool  hands  till  the  milk  is  thoroughly</span><span>  squeezed  out,  and  then  to  proceed  with  the  salting.</span><span>  Theoretically,  I  should  consider  this  latter  as  the</span><span>  best  plan,  since  it  exposes  the  cheesy  matter  less</span><span>  to  the  air,  and  consequently  to  less  risk  of  incipient</span><span>  decomposition</span></p> <p><span>  Some  fancy  they  cure  their  butter  better  by  dis-</span><span>  solving  the  salt  in  the  cream  before  churning,</span><span>  while  many  consider  its  preservation  and  good</span><span>  quality  to  depend  much  upon  the  quality  of  the</span><span>  salt  that  is  employed.</span></p> <p><span>  NATIVE  BREAD.-An  interesting  paper  on  this</span><span>  singular  esculent,  the  Gastrodia  Sessamoides  of</span><span>  Linnaeus  has  been  handed  to  us.  it  is  the  pro-</span><span>  duction  of  Mr.  J.  W.  Graves,  jun.,  and  consists</span><span>  of  a  series  of  observations  on  this  portion  of  our</span><span>  indigenous  Flora,  the  result  of  long  and  careful</span><span>  attention  to  its  mode  of  growth,  and  of  an  im-</span><span>  pression  that  its  culture  may  be  turned  to  profita-</span></p> <p><span>  ble  account.  Mr.  Graves  states  that  the  native</span><span>  bread,  as  an  esculent,  continued  to  be  preferred</span><span>  by  the  aborigines,  to  potatoes  and  other  edible</span><span>  roots,  and  that  they  possessed  some  instinctive</span><span>  means  of  discovering  it  at  will.  With  respect  to</span><span>  its  habits,  Mr.  Graves  adds,  that  it  seems  to  prefer</span><span>  loamy  soil  on  low  or  sloping  ground,  and  that  the</span><span>  first  indications  of  its  vegetation  are  in  the  spring</span><span>  season,  when  a  whitish  bulb  will  appear  on  the</span><span>  sward.  This  bulb  is  of  a  hemispherical  shape,</span><span>  and  about  the  size  of  a  small  egg.  The  dusky</span><span>  white  covering  of  this  will  be  found  to  resemble  a</span><span>  fine  white  net,  and  within  it  is  a  pellucid  gelatin-</span><span>  ous  substance.  Again,  within  this  latter,  is  a</span><span>  firm  kernel,  about  as  large  as  a  Spanish  nut,  and</span><span>  from  this  a  fine  fibrous  root  descends  into  the  soil.</span><span>  The  spots  where  these  appearances  have  been  ob-</span><span>  served,  Mr.  Graves  has  marked,  and  on  digging  a</span><span>  few  months  afterwards,  has  invariably  found  the</span><span>  native  bread  in  perfection.  While  Mr.  Graves</span><span>  deserves  ample  praise  for  a  series  of  remarks  and</span><span>  a  minuteness  of  attention  that  would  do  credit  to</span><span>  a  scientific  botanist,  we  much  fear  that  his  sug-</span><span>  gestions  may  not  prove  susceptible  of  the  practica-</span><span>  ble  application  he  would  wish.  The  Gastrodia,</span><span>  or  native  bread,  is,  we  believe,  a  parasitic  plant,</span><span>  and,  in  common  with  its  cogenus,  would  pro-</span><span>  bably  be  found  difficult  of  systematic  cultivation.</span><span>  Whether,  in  any  other  way,  the  abundant  self</span><span>  propagation  of  this  peculiar  plant  might  be  ren-</span><span>  dered  available,  we  are  unable  to  say.  We  shall,</span><span>  however,  be  happy  to  receive  any  communication</span></p> <p><span>  either  from  Mr.  Graves  or  others  who  have  de-</span></p> <p><span>  voted  to  it  observation  or  experiment.-Hobart</span></p> <p><span>  Town  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  TRISTAN  DE  ACUNHA.-The  following  interest-</span><span>  ing  particulars  are  extracted  from  the  log  of</span><span>  Captain  Salmon  of  the  Reward:—""  On  the  18th</span><span>  September,  1845,  we  sighted  the  island  of  Tristan</span><span>  de  Acunha,  in  the  latitude  of  37°5'  South,  long.</span><span>  12°3'  West,  at  six  o'clock  in  the  morning  ;  its</span><span>  snow-capped  top  was  visible  above  the  clouds,  it</span><span>  being  8326  feet  above  the  level  of  the  sea,  and</span><span>  throughout  the  year  covered  with  snow  on  its</span><span>  summit.  The  wind  being  favourable,  and  the</span><span>  weather  fine,  and  knowing  there  were  inhabitants</span><span>  on  it,  1  steered  direct  for  it,  passing  an  island  to</span><span>  the  southward  called  Inaccessible,  where  the  ship</span><span>  Blendon  Hall,  of  London,  was  lost  in  the  year</span><span>  1821,  by  running  on  to  it  in  a  thick  fog,  The</span><span>  inhabitants  of  Tristan  de  Acunha  were  aware  that</span><span>  a  vessel  had  been  lost  near  the  islands,  or  on</span><span>  them,  for  a  long  while  before  a  boat  came  from</span><span>  Inaccessible  Island,  by  the  drifting  of  pieces  of</span><span>  wreck  on  the  shores  and  rocks  of  Tristan  de</span><span>  Acunha.  The  Acunahites  never  venture  over  to</span><span>  the  other  islands,  having  nothing  but  whale-boats.</span><span>  The  population  of  this  island  amounts  in  all  to</span><span>  ninety  souls,  as  stated  to  me  by  Mr.  Glass—who</span><span>  has  fifteen  children  living,  and  one  of  them  is</span><span>  married  to  an  American  of  the  name  of  Dellay.</span><span>  Mr.  Glass  is  now  in  the  seventy-second  year  of</span><span>  his  age,  and  has  been  thirty  years  on  the  island  ;</span><span>  he  is  one  of  those  who  were  sent  by  the  British</span><span>  Government  at  the  time  of  Napoleon's  imprison-</span><span>  ment  at  the  Island  of  St.  Helena.  The  appearance</span><span>  of  Tristan  de  Acunha  on  the  north  side,  was  an</span><span>  isolated  piece  of  land  and  rock,  of  about  two  miles</span><span>  in  extent,  and  about  100  feet  above  the  level  of  the</span><span>  sea.  On  our  near  approach  to  the  island  we  were</span><span>  surprised,  first,  to  get  in  view  large  white  build-</span><span>  ings  and  corn-fields  all  laid  out  in  neat  order  and</span><span>  enclosed  ;  next,  to  see  a  large  green  plain  with</span><span>  cattle  grazing,  and  flocks  of  sheep  in  different</span><span>  enclosures,  and  patches  of  green  on  the  sides</span><span>  of  the  hill,  which  we  were  told  were  gardens,</span><span>  filled  with  cabbages,  turnips,  and  all  other  vege-</span><span>  tables,  which  grow  in  abundance.  Wheat  grows</span><span>  well,  and  about  60  acres  of  land  are  in  a  good</span><span>  state  of  cultivation  for  corn,  if  they  had  ships</span><span>  calling  off  for  supplies  they  would  grow  more.</span><span>  About  five  ships,  American  whalers,  call  here  an-</span><span>  nually  to  take  in  supplies,  and  in  return  give</span><span>  clothing,  coffee,  and  tea,  but  two  English  vessels</span><span>  have  called  there  for  the  last  year.  Coarse  cotton</span><span>  or  sheeting  is  very  much  wanted  by  the  Islanders</span><span>  for  the  females,  as  they  have  to  make  such  neces-</span><span>  sary  things  out  of  slop  cotton  shirts,  as  very  few</span><span>  ships  have  any  cotton  or  sheeting  not  made  up.</span><span>  I  could  have  supplied  them  with  silk  or  fine  goods,</span></p> <p><span>  but  these  articles  were  useless  to  them,  at  all</span><span>  events  they  had  no  money  to  purchase  them.</span></p> <p><span>  There  are  on  the  island,  out  of  the  whole  popu-</span><span>  lation  of  90  souls,  66  females  ;  20  are  from  12  to</span></p> <p><span>  26.  years  of  age,  7  are  from  55  to  64  years  of  age,</span><span>  and  the  others  are  of  younger  years—some  only</span><span>  a  few  months  old  ;  and  they  have  no  means  of</span><span>  getting  suitable  clothing  for  them.  The  boys  are</span><span>  wearing  sheep-skins,  and  the  men  get  coarse</span><span>  canvass  from  the  ships.  On  getting  close  in  with</span><span>  the  Island,  with  the  English  ensign  at  the  main</span><span>  royal  mast  head,  we  saw  the  inhabitants  moving</span><span>  in  all  directions  towards  the  shore  ;  and  close  in</span><span>  to  the  great  water  course  from  the  hills,  (which</span><span>  flows  down  from  the  rocks,  of  100  feet,  on  the</span><span>  beach,)  we  saw  the  whale  boat  taken  and  dragged</span><span>  towards  the  surf  ;  a  person,  with  a  dark  dress,</span><span>  was  then  put  in  and  seated  in  her  stern  ;  those</span><span>  who  were  to  compose  her  crew  got  ready,  and</span><span>  with  the  assistance  of  those  on  shore  she  was</span><span>  pushed  in  through  the  surf,  of  which,  in  a  short</span><span>  time,  we  saw  her  clear.  We  then  hove  the  ship</span><span>  to,  and  made  preparations  to  receive  the  Governor</span><span>  on  board,  by  getting  the  ladder  over  the  side  ;  the</span><span>  boat  was  rowed  by  four  men  at  the  oars  and  one</span><span>  to  steer  ;  in  the  stern  sat  a  person  dressed  in  a</span><span>  hair  cap,  with  a  pilot  coat  over-all  ;  when  he  came</span><span>  on  deck  I  asked  him  if  Governor  Glass  was  living  ?</span><span>  he  said  he  was  the  person  ;  he  then  asked  the</span><span>  usual  questions  of  where  from,  and  whither  bound,</span><span>  and  the  news  ;  but  he  did  not  ask  for  his  Des-</span><span>  patches  from  the  British  Government.  He  had</span><span>  never  received  any  relief  or  support  since  he  has</span><span>  been  on  the  Island,  although  he  has  several  times</span><span>  been  promised  that  his  forlorn  case  should  be  re-</span><span>  presented  to  the  Secretary  for  the  Colonies.  Sir</span><span>  George  Gipps  landed  at  the  Island  on  his  passage</span><span>  out  to  New  South  Wales,  about  January,  1838,</span><span>  and  promised  to  lay  his  case  before  the  British</span><span>  Government,  but  this  has  met  with  the  proverbial</span><span>  fate  of  ""  putting  faith  in  Princes,""  &c.  Similar</span><span>  promises  have  frequently  been  made  to  Governor</span><span>  Glass  during  the  last  twenty-five  years,  and  with</span><span>  the  same  result.  Tristan  de  Acunha  being  a  little</span><span>  out  of  the  usual  track  of  ships  to  the  east,  but</span><span>  few  British  ships  have  ever  called  there  since  the</span><span>  Island  was  inhabited,  though  many  pass  in  sight</span><span>  of  it  ;  if  the  American  whale  ships  were  not  to</span><span>  visit  it  occasionally,  the  inhabitants  would  be  in  a</span><span>  very  bad  state  for  clothing.  For  the  last  two</span><span>  years  there  has  not  been  so  many  vessels  calling</span><span>  at  the  Island,  as  the  seal  and  whale  have  nearly</span><span>  disappeared  from  this  locality  ;  only  two  of</span><span>  H.  M.  ships  have  been  there  for  the  last  twenty</span><span>  years.  After  Mr.  Glass  had  heard  what  news  I</span><span>  had  to  report,  he  wished  to  know  if  I  wanted  any</span><span>  supplies.  I  said  I  was  in  want  of  potatoes,  if</span><span>  they  had  any  on  the  Island  ;  he  expressed  his</span><span>  readiness  to  supply  me  with  any  quantity.  It</span><span>  being  now  four  o'clock  in  the  afternoon,  he  took</span><span>  his  departure  to  the  shore,  and  returned  again  in</span><span>  about  an  hour  and  a  half  with  as  many  potatoes</span><span>  as  I  had  ordered  ;  in  return  for  which  I  gave  him</span><span>  coffee,  tea,  and  rice.  I  presented  him  with  some</span><span>  small  children's  books  ;  he  was  very  much  in</span><span>  want  of  some  catechisms  and  question  books.  He</span><span>  had  about  2000  lbs.  of  wool  for  disposal,  it  being</span><span>  the  clip  for  two  years  of  his  flock  of  sheep,.which</span><span>  numbers  about  400.  He  formerly  sold  his  wool</span><span>  to  the  American  whale  ships,  when  they  were</span><span>  homeward  bound,  but  none  of  them  have  since</span><span>  called  when  bound  home,  and  consequently  it  has</span><span>  lain  on  his  hands.  I  would  have  purchased  it</span><span>  from  him,  but  as  night  had  overtaken  us,  and  not</span><span>  wishing  to  stop  until  the  next  day,  we  bade  fare-</span><span>  well  to  Governor  Glass,  made  sail  on  our  voyage,</span><span>  and,  like  many  more,  promised  to  call  on  our  next</span><span>  voyage  to  the  Eastern  Hemisphere,  (should  we  be</span><span>  spared,)  and,  if  possible,  raise  a  small  subscription</span><span>  when  in  London  to  the  amount  of  one  hundred</span><span>  pounds,  so  as  to  purchase  such  articles  as  they</span><span>  stated  to  me  they  were  in  great  need  of  ;  their</span><span>  agricultural  implements  are  in  a  bad  state,  and</span><span>  they  are  much  in  need  of  a  mill  to  grind  corn,</span><span>  and  other  articles,  (too  numerous  to  mention).  1</span><span>  am  happy  to  state  that  the  children  are  all  taught</span><span>  to  read  and  attend  religious  worship  ;  Mr.  Glass</span><span>  is  their  instructor,  he  told  me  that  he  had  taught</span><span>  them  all,  and  that  a  blessing  was  offered  at  every</span><span>  meal,  and  prayers  at  night  in  every  family,  and</span><span>  on  the  Sabbath  Day  he  did  the  duty  of  minister</span><span>  for  the  whole  ;  he  said  he  was  everything  to  them,</span><span>  but  he  is  quite  feeble  and  not  fit  for  such  a  task  ;</span><span>  could  a  good  person  be  found,  of  or  about  the  age</span><span>  of  fifty,  who  would  wish  to  go  to  such  a  place,</span><span>  and  be  their  instructor,  he  would  be  gladly  re-</span><span>  ceived  by  them,  and  would  find  a  good  home,</span><span>  away  from  the  cares  of  this  busy  life.  The  pre-</span><span>  sent  adults  are  comparatively  ignorant,  and  on</span><span>  the  death  of  Governor  Glass  there  will  be  some</span><span>  one  wanting  to  instruct  and  govern  them.  They</span><span>  have  every  necessary  that  is  wanting  as  food  for</span><span>  the  body,  but  food  for  the  soul,  they  have  none.</span><span>  If  any  of  the  Missionary  Societies  would  send  out</span><span>  a  minister  to  them,  he  would  be  gladly  received.</span><span>  I  am  at  a  loss  to  conjecture  for  what  reason  the</span></p> <p><span>  John  Williams  omitted  to  call  at  this  island  on</span></p> <p><span>  her  passage  out  last  year,  to  visit  the  various</span><span>  Islands  in  the  South  Sea.

Mr.  Hely  is  waiting  at</span><span>  the  Springs  for  the  mail,  in  order  to  get  intelli-</span><span>  gence  respecting  Sir  Thomas  Mitchell's  expediton.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  FERRY  TOLLS.—The  ferries  were  put  up</span><span>  at  auction  on  Wednesday  ;  and  after  spirited  com-</span><span>  petition,  the  North  and  South  Brisbane  Ferry  was</span><span>  let  at  the  comparatively  large  sum  of  £240  That</span><span>  between  North  Brisbane  and  Kangaroo  Point  was</span></p> <p><span>  let  at  £32.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  ""  EXPERIMENT.""—We  regret  to  learn  that</span><span>  this  steamer  is  to  be  laid  up  for  seven  or  eight</span><span>  days,  in  order  that  the  boilers  may  be  repaired.</span></p> <p><span>  TICKETS-OF-LEAVE.  —  The  undermentioned</span></p> <p><span>  prisoners  of  the  Crown  have  obtained  tickets-of-</span><span>  leave  since  our  last  publication  :—Josias  Clarke,</span><span>  Emma  Eugenia  ;  Patrick  Neill,  Heier  ;  William</span><span>  Thompson,  Charles  Kerr.</span></p> <p><span>  PORT  CURTIS.  —  The  following  remarks  are</span><span>  published  in  an  octavo  volume,  called  ""  The  Pic-</span><span>  ture  of  Australia,""  published  in  1829,  page  22  :-</span><span>  ""Breaksea-spit  is  a  reef  of  broken  coral  and  sand,</span><span>  extending  about  twenty  miles  north  of  a  long  and</span><span>  narrow  point-on  the  east  side  of  which  is  Indian</span><span>  Head,  the  easternmost  cape  of  New  Holland.</span><span>  Within  this  point  and  the  Spit  there  is  Hervey's</span><span>  Bay,  a  considerable  opening.  This  bay  affords</span><span>  an  anchorage  ;  but  the  land  at  the  head  of  it  is</span><span>  low-though  hills  appear  in  the  distance.  The</span><span>  part  on  the  east  is  barren  and  there  does  not  appear</span><span>  to  be  any  considerable  rivers.  The  shore  con-</span></p> <p><span>  tinues  of  the  same  character  as  on  the  west  side</span></p> <p><span>  of  Hervey's  Bay  till  Port  Curtis  a  little  north  of</span><span>  lat.  24  be  reached.  Port  Curtis  is  protected  from</span><span>  the  sea  by  Fairy  Island,  which  is  of  considerable</span><span>  size,  but  barren,  and  with  little  or  no  fresh  water.</span><span>  In  general  indeed  the  shores  of  the  bay  are  not  of</span><span>  the  most  promising  nature.  The  trees  are  stunted,</span><span>  and  the  hills  stony  and  barren.  There  is  one</span><span>  mountain  stream,  the  ""Boyne,""  upon  the  banks</span><span>  of  which,  a  little  into  the  interior,  there  are  a  few</span><span>  patches  of  fertile  land,  but  they  are  not  of  any</span><span>  considerable  extent.  Northward  of  Port  Curtis,</span><span>  and  immediately  under  the  tropic  of  Capricorn,</span><span>  there  is  another  opening,  Keppel's  Bay,  the  head</span><span>  of  which  is  connected  by  a  channel  with  that  of</span><span>  Port  Curtis,  but  the  channel  is  so  shallow  as  to</span><span>  be  dry  at  low  water.  The  shores  of  both  these</span><span>  openings  are  in  general  so  thick  with  mangroves,</span><span>  that  no  landing  can  be  effected,  and  though  it</span><span>  produces  some  trees  and  grass,  is  apparently  so</span><span>  stony  as  not  to  be  fit  for  agricultural  purposes.</span><span>  Captain  King,  who  examined  this  shore  with  more</span><span>  minuteness  than  any  other  navigator,  gives  it  as</span><span>  his  opinion  that  there  is  little  to  be  sought  for</span><span>  south  of  the  17th  degree.""</span></p> <p><span>  The  NEW  COLONY.-The  following  is  the  sub-</span><span>  stance  of  the  evidence  given  by  Colonel  Barney,</span><span>  before  the  Select  Committee  of  the  Legislative</span><span>  Council,  on  the  renewal  of  transportation,  re-</span><span>  specting  the  new  settlement  of  North  Australia  :</span><span>  -It  is  to  be  composed  first  of  all  of  persons  from</span><span>  the  Penitentiary  at  Pentonville  who  have  gone</span><span>  through  their  probation.  The  first  party,  con-</span><span>  sisting  of  between  200  and  300  men  with  their</span><span>  families,  is  expected  to  arrive  about  the  middle  of</span><span>  January  ;  they  will  be  the  lighter  class  of  of-</span><span>  fenders.  A  similar  class  are  to  be  sent  from  Van</span><span>  Diemen's  Land.  (It  was  quite  notorious  in  Eng-</span><span>  land,  that  people  committed  petty  crimes  for  the</span><span>  sake  of  getting  into  the  penitentiaries.)  Upon</span><span>  landing  they  will  be  put  into  tents  till  they  can</span><span>  build  huts  for  themselves.  They  are  to  be  put  in</span><span>  possession  of  an  allotment  of  five  acres  of  land  ;</span><span>  or  not  exceeding  ten  acres,  to  those  who  have</span><span>  large  families.  This  land  they  are  to  hold  for</span><span>  three  years,  free  of  expense  ;  and  at  the  expiration</span><span>  of  that  time  they  are  to  determine  whether  they</span><span>  will  become  permanent  possessors  of  the  land  or</span><span>  not  ;  if  they  become  settlers,  they  are  (as  we</span><span>  stated  in  this  journal  some  time  ago)  to  purchase</span><span>  the  land  at  the  rate  of  £1  per  acre  ;  which  is  to</span><span>  be  paid  for  in  half-yearly  instalments  spread  over</span><span>  a  period  of  ten  years.  The  government  is  to</span><span>  supply  them  with  provisions,  clothing,  tools,  seed,</span><span>  and  stock,  but  not  after  the  first  year.  There  is</span><span>  to  be  no  restriction  as  to  leaving  the  settlement</span><span>  if  they  wish  to  do  so,  and  in  fact  it  may  be  con-</span><span>  sidered  as  a  labour  depot  for  this  colony.  There</span><span>  would  be  no  objection  to  the  people  of  Moreton</span><span>  Bay  sending  for  a  supply  of  these  men.  He  fur-</span><span>  ther  states,  that  he  has  had  many  applications</span><span>  from  parties  in  Sydney  to  be  allowed  to  go  down</span><span>  and  settle  there,  with  the  view  of  becoming  store-</span><span>  keepers,  and  to  engage  in  various  pursuits.  There</span><span>  is  no  positive  limitation  as  to  going  within  the</span><span>  limits  of  the  tropics.  He  thinks  that  the  men</span><span>  coming  from  Pentonville  will  be  in  a  better  posi-</span><span>  tion  as  regards  moral  character  than  the  great</span><span>  mass  of  immigrants-they  will  have  had  the  be-</span><span>  nefits  of  religious  instruction,  have  acquired  habits</span><span>  of  industry,  and  become  masters  of  various  trades  ;</span><span>  but  they  will  not  have  learned  that  which  would</span><span>  suit  them  best  for  North  Australia,  the  art  of</span><span>  tilling  the  ground.  In  the  event  of  the  loss  of</span><span>  the  crops,  or  of  inveterate  idleness,  it  may  be  ne-</span><span>  cessary  to  furnish  some  of  the  people  with  food  for</span><span>  more  than  a  year.  In  the  case  of  loss  of  crops  the</span></p> <p><span>  Government  must  assist  them.  It  is  not  con-</span></p> <p><span>  templated  to  have  free  mechanics  to  build  stores</span><span>  or  houses  at  the  new  settlement,  as  the  services</span><span>  of  the  people  sent  there  will  be  at  the  disposal  of</span><span>  the  Government  during  the  year  for  which  they</span><span>  are  provisioned.  These  men  will  not  be  paid  over</span></p> <p><span>  and  above  their  rations  in  such  cases.  Colonel</span><span>  Barney  confirms  a  statement  we  made  some  time</span><span>  since,  that  the  Guardians  of  the  Poor  in  England</span><span>  are  now  making  arrangements  with  Government</span><span>  for  sending  out  the  wives  and  families  of  the</span><span>  convicts,  and  the  paupers  who  may  be  willing  to</span><span>  proceed  to  this  colony.  Such  are  the  most  im-</span><span>  portant  facts  elicited  by  his  evidence  before  the</span><span>  Council.  He  is  of  opinion  that  the  people  with</span><span>  families  will  be  inclined  to  remain  at  the  settle-</span><span>  ment  ;  because  they  will  during  the  first  year,</span><span>  when  they  receive  provisions,  build  their  huts,  get</span><span>  their  gardens  in  order,  and  have  their  pigs  and</span><span>  poultry  ;  and  under  such  circumstances  will  not,</span><span>  he  thinks,  be  disposed  to  move.  Of  course  each</span><span>  person  will  be  allowed  to  purchase  more  than  ten</span><span>  acres,  if  they  choose,  provided  they  have  the</span></p> <p><span>  means.</span></p> <p><span>  PROTECTION  OF  THE  ABORIGINES.-The  follow-</span><span>  ing  is  an  extract  from  a  private  letter  from  More-</span><span>  ton  Bay  :-  ""Some  parties  went  out  last  week  into</span><span>  the  bush,  and  fired  at  a  crowd  of  blacks  in  their</span><span>  camp,  hoping  to  shoot  one  of  those  for  whom  a</span><span>  reward  is  offered,  as  the  murderer  of  Mr.  Gregor.</span><span>  They  brought  in  one  black,  Millbong  Jemmy,</span><span>  quite  dead,  having  driven  three  balls  through  him,</span><span>  and  they  received  the  reward.  I  have  heard  it</span></p> <p><span>  whispered  that  the  blacks  have  been  shot  in  all</span><span>  directions,  and  that  some  persons  in  authority  are</span><span>  conniving  at  it.  The  Government  ought  to  give</span><span>  the  aborigines  some  protection,  else  they  will  be</span><span>  soon  swept  away  in  this  district.  The  Moreton</span><span>  Bay  Courier  advocates  their  utter  destruction  !  !""</span><span>  -Sydney  Chronicle.-[Who  this  veracious  cor-</span><span>  respondent  (  anguis  in  herba  )  may  be,  we  know</span><span>  not,  neither  do  we  care;  we  are  quite  certain,</span><span>  however,  that  ""  he  is  a  butcher  of  the  truth,  and</span><span>  an  assassin  of  facts.""  When  we  tell  this  man  that</span><span>  we  hate  liars,  we  hope  he  will  believe  us.-ED.</span><span>  M.  B.  C.  ]</span></p> <p><span>  THE  WEATHER  AND  THE  ROADS.-During  the</span><span>  past  week  we  have  had  some  splendid  weather.</span><span>  The  abundant  rains  of  the  last  few  weeks  have</span><span>  produced  a  rapid  growth  amongst  the  green  crops,</span><span>  which  become  fresher  and  greener  every  day.  At</span><span>  the  same  time  the  powerful  sun  and  drying  winds</span><span>  are  bringing  the  maize  crops  towards  maturity.</span><span>  There  is  every  prospect  of  a  continuance  of  fine</span><span>  weather.  As  a  drawback,  however,  to  the  fore-</span><span>  going,  we  must  state  that  the  roads  are  still  nearly</span><span>  in  an  impassable  state  for  the  wool-teams,  many</span><span>  of  which  have  been  detained  five  weeks  between</span></p> <p><span>  Ipswich  and  the  Main  Range.  A  great  deal  of</span><span>  the  wool  is  in  a  very  wet  state,  and  will  have  to  be</span><span>  repacked  previous  to  shipment.  Those  persons</span><span>  who  had  not  foresight  enough  to  provide  tarpaw-</span><span>  lings  for  their  drays,  will  be  subjected  to  serious</span><span>  loss  by  the  depreciation  that  must  necessarily  take</span><span>  place  in  the  value  of  the  wool,  and  the  expenses  of</span><span>  putting  it  in  a  fit  state  for  shipment.  Nearly  all</span><span>  the  bridges  over  the  creeks  have  been  carried  away</span><span>  by  the  floods,  and  it  is  absolutely  necessary  that</span><span>  something  should  be  done  by  the  Government,  im-</span><span>  mediately,  to  repair  these  disasters.  In  the  mean-</span><span>  time,  the  squatters  rest  quietly  on  their  oars,  and,</span><span>  we  presume,  are  too  much  absorbed  in  shearing</span><span>  to  allow  of  their  urging  their  claims  for  assistance</span><span>  on  the  Executive  Government.  They  must,  as</span><span>  soon  as  they  can  possibly  spare  the  time,  meet  for</span><span>  this  purpose  ;  if  they  neglect  to  take  proper  steps,</span><span>  we  fear  that  the  communication  between  the  in-</span><span>  terior  and  the  port  will  become  more  difficult  and</span><span>  dangerous  every  day.  None  but  the  strongest</span><span>  and  most  energetic  remonstrances  will  induce  our</span><span>  precious  Government  to  concede  to  us  our  un-</span><span>  doubted  right  to  a  proportion  of  the  sum  voted  by</span><span>  the  Council  for  the  repairs  of  the  roads  through-</span><span>  out  the  colony.  Let  the  squatters,  then,  look  to  it.</span><span>  The  Government  know  our  weakness,  and  un-</span><span>  generously  take  advantage  of  it.  We  shall  have  a</span><span>  word  to  say  to  Mr.  McLeay  by  and  bye.</span></p> <p><span>  A  GENUINE  PHILANTHROPIST.-We  learn  with</span><span>  sincere  regret  that  Mr.  Robert  Little,  of  the  late  firm</span><span>  of  Little  &  Phelan,  and  one  of  the  oldest  commercial</span><span>  settlers  in  this  district,  is  about  to  leave  this  place</span><span>  for  Sydney.  Mr.  Little  during  his  residence  in</span><span>  Brisbane  has  gained  the  esteem  and  regard  of</span><span>  every  one  anxious  for  the  moral  well-doing  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  rising  generation,  by  his  unceasing  endeavours</span><span>  to  promote  education,  and  to  propagate  religious</span><span>  principles  amongst  the  youth  of  both  sexes.  It</span><span>  was  during  the  second  year  of  his  residence  in</span><span>  this  town,  that  he  determined  upon  erecting  a</span><span>  suitable  building,  at  his  own  expense,  to  be  devoted</span><span>  to  educational  and  religious  purposes.  He  was</span><span>  urged  to  do  this  by  observing  the  utter  destitution</span><span>  of  the  children,  who  without  supervision  and  con-</span><span>  trol,  and  placed  under  no  moral  restraint,  were</span><span>  permitted  to  rove  about  the  town,  and  contract</span><span>  habits  of  the  most  immoral  and  irreligious  kind,</span><span>  owing  to  their  being  no  teachers  at  that  time  in</span><span>  the  township.  To  the  credit  of  the  inhabitants</span><span>  be  it  recorded,  Mr.  Little's  endeavours  were</span><span>  crowned  with  success,  and  he  has  the  satisfaction</span><span>  of  being  the  first  individual  who  established  a</span><span>  Sunday  School  in  the  district.  We  have  the  tes-</span><span>  timony  of  many  of  the  parents  of  the  children</span><span>  frequenting  the  school,  that  they  have  profited</span><span>  greatly  by  their  attendance,  and  that  the  scholars</span></p> <p><span>  are  the  best-behaved  children  in  the  town.  Mr.</span><span>  Little's  conduct  is  the  more  to  be  admired,  because</span><span>  it  is  disinterested.  Unassuming  and  retired  in</span><span>  his  habits,  with  the  one  idea  always  uppermost  in</span><span>  his  mind-the  moral  welfare  of  his  youthful  pupils</span><span>  -he  deserves  all  the  praise  that  we  have  it  in  our</span><span>  power  to  bestow.  The  sceptic  may  perhaps</span><span>  smile,  and  the  libertine  laugh  at  this  encomium  ;</span><span>  but  those  who  are  acquainted  with  the  real  worth,</span><span>  and  Christian  qualities  of  the  man,  will  appreciate</span><span>  the  justness  of  our  remarks,  and  join  with  us  in</span><span>  wishing  him  every  success  in  whatever  place  he</span><span>  may  hereafter  take  up  his  residence.  We  are  not</span><span>  in  the  habit  of  stepping  out  of  our  way  to  notice</span><span>  the  acts  of  private  individuals  ;  but  in  this  instance</span><span>  we  have  been  impelled  by  a  sense  of  justice  to</span><span>  record  the  meritorious  conduct  of  Mr.  Little,  in</span><span>  the  hope  that  many  others  will  be  induced  to  walk</span><span>  in  his  footsteps,  and  follow  his  bright  example.</span><span>  We  understand  that  on  Tuesday  evening  Mr.</span><span>  Little  gave  a  juvenile  tea  party  to  his  scholars  at</span><span>  the  School-house,  and  that  upwards  of  sixty  chil-</span><span>  dren,  accompanied  by  many  of  their  parents,  were</span><span>  present  on  the  occasion.  After  partaking  of  the</span><span>  hospitality  of  their  entertainer,  several  valedictory</span><span>  speeches  were  delivered,  to  which  Mr.  Little  gave</span><span>  suitable  replies.  The  party  then  separated,</span><span>  impressed  with  a  grateful  sense  of  Mr.  Little's</span><span>  kindness,  and  unfeigned  regret  at  his  projected</span><span>  departure  from  the  district.</span></p> <p><span>  RESULT  OF  SALES.-Mr.  T.

"<p><span>  NORFOLK  ISLAND.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  been  recently  favoured  with  important</span><span>  intelligence  from  this  island,  and  as  it  is  but  rarely</span><span>  any  of  the  doings  of  that  unhappy  spot  reach  the</span><span>  public  ear  or  eye,  we  are  glad  to  have  it  in  our</span><span>  power  to  communicate  an  account  of  the  late  pro-</span><span>  ceedings,  upon  which  our  readers  may  full  rely.</span><span>  A  more  melancholy  one  can  scarcely  be  imagined,</span><span>  and  if  to  what  we  now  publish  we  were  to  add  other</span><span>  enormities  with  which  we  have  heen  made  ac-</span><span>  quainted,  we  can  scarcely  doubt  but  that  the  whole</span><span>  community  would  indignantly  protest  against  the</span><span>  continuance  of  a  system  which,  it  may  be  feared,</span><span>  will  sooner  or  later  call  down  the  vengeance  of</span><span>  God,  as  of  old,  upon  the  nation  which  can  tolerate</span><span>  such  a  festering  mass  of  wickedness.  The  late</span><span>  Commandant,  it  was  universally  confessed,  was</span><span>  unfitted  in  every  possible  way  for  the  duties  most</span><span>  unaccountably  entrusted  to  him.</span></p> <p><span>  The  following  may  be  relied  upon  as  a  correct</span><span>  outline  of  the  late  transactions,  and  of  the  incen-</span><span>  tives  which  terminated  in  so  frightful  and  fatal  a</span><span>  tragedy.</span></p> <p><span>  From  a  state  of  really  quiet  obedience,  the</span><span>  island,  from  the  time  the  prisoners  (who  are  not</span><span>  slow  to  appreciate  character)  began  to  perceive  the</span><span>  weakness  of  the  Superintendent,  fell  into.  a  gradu-</span><span>  ally  increasing  state  of  insubordination.  Some  of</span><span>  the  prisoners  cringed,  others  plotted,  ;and  more</span><span>  bullied  him.  Temporary  expedients  were  resorted</span><span>  to,  in  order  to  keep  them  quiet,  but  all  discipline</span><span>  was  relaxed,  and  when  the  difficulty  of  managing</span><span>  them  became  daily  greater,  and  the  various  officers</span><span>  remonstrated,  their  conplaints  were  either  treated</span><span>  with  rudeness,  or  altogether  evaded.  To  make</span><span>  matters  worse,  an  increasing  number  of  desperate</span><span>  ruffians  began  to  be  landed  from  Van  Diemen's</span><span>  Land,  who  soon  rendered  the  English  prisoners  as</span><span>  mischievous  as  themselves.  What  a  state  of</span><span>  things  !  An  absolute  ruler  !  yet  thoroughly  in-</span><span>  capable  ;  at  'war  with  almost  every  officer  in  the</span><span>  island,  bearded  by  the  convicts,  and  at  length  in</span><span>  open  day  knocked  down  by  one  of  them  It  would</span><span>  occupy  too  much  time  to  tell  of  the  progressive</span><span>  steps  by  which  the  total  insubordination  of  the</span><span>  convicts,  and  the  disorganization  of  all  system</span><span>  were  brought  about.</span></p> <p><span>  Mutinous  disturbances  began  towards  the  close</span><span>  of  last  year.  The  ration  of  the  prisoners  has  al-</span><span>  ways  been  notoriously  bad  at  Norfolk  Island</span><span>  throughout  the  year  they  have  salt  beef  and  maize</span><span>  meal  only,  so  that  but  for  the  indulgence  (always</span><span>  allowed  them)  of  growing  a  few  sweet  potatoes  in</span><span>  plots  of  ground  marked  out  for  their  use  and  cul-</span><span>  tivated  by  them  on  Saturday  afternoons,  their  fare</span><span>  would  have  been  positively  destructive  of  life,  as</span><span>  indeed  it  frequently  proved  to  the  freshly  arrived</span><span>  prisoners,  before  they  could  grow  potatoes  for</span><span>  themselves.  On  the  1st  of  January,  a  public  order</span><span>  was  posted  to  the  effect,  that  all  their  garden  plots</span><span>  was  henceforth  to  be  taken  away  from  them.  It  is</span><span>  difficult  for  a  person  unacquainted  with  the  island</span></p> <p><span>  to  conceive  the  commotion  this  occasioned.  The</span><span>  prisoners  refused  to  work  unless  some  equivalent</span><span>  were  given  for  the  potatoes,  and  after  some  hesi-</span><span>  tation,  which  only  rendered  matters  worse,  a  half</span><span>  pint  of  peas  was  promised  to  each  man  daily.  At</span><span>  the  end  of  three  or  four  days  the  peas  were  said  to</span><span>  be  all  issued,  and  there  was  another  row.  The</span><span>  Superintendent  then  promised  to  have  8  oz.  of  12</span><span>  per  cent.  flour  served  out  in  lieu  of  the  peas.  To</span><span>  add  to  this  unhappy  state  of  affairs,  a  resident</span><span>  Police  Magistrate  had  been  appointed  from  Van</span><span>  Diemen's  Land,  who  very  soon  rendered  himself</span><span>  an  object  of  vengeance.  The  flogging  became</span><span>  perfectly  furious,  from  500  to  nearly  2000  lashes</span><span>  were  inflicted  of  a  morning,  until  the  ground  about</span><span>  the  triangles  was  literally  soaked  with  human  blood.</span></p> <p><span>  Matters  daily  grew  worse,  the  wretched  men  by</span><span>  this  sort  of  alternate  rage  and  peevish  vacillation</span><span>  gradually  grew  more  and  more  exasperated  and</span><span>  insubordinate.  About  the  commencement  of  June</span></p> <p><span>  the  store  of  flour  was  reported  by  the  Commis-</span><span>  sariat  officer  to  be  nearly  exhausted,  and  as  a</span></p> <p><span>  matter  of  course  the  8  oz.  of  flour  were  discon-</span><span>  tinued.  The  men  became  more  clamorous  than</span></p> <p><span>  ever.  By  an  order  published  in  May,  1845,  and</span><span>  forming  part  of  the  Van  Diemen's  Land  Regula-</span><span>  tions  for  Norfolk  Island,  it  had  been  announced</span><span>  that  the  gardens  being  no  longer  allowed,  2  lbs.</span><span>  of  sweet  potatoes  should  form  a  part  of  the  daily</span><span>  ration  to  each  prisoner.  It  will  scarcely  be  credited</span><span>  that  Major  Childs  caused  this  order  to  be  posted</span><span>  up  at  every  station  on  the  island  ;  yet  knowing  at</span><span>  the  time  he  did  so,  that  it  was  impossible  to  furnish</span><span>  the  men  with  a  single  oz.  daily  of  sweet  potatoe  !</span><span>  During  fourteen  months  this  order  had  been  hang-</span><span>  ing  up  before  the  men's  eyes  ;  they  read  it,  and</span><span>  again  and  again  demanded  their  allowance  of</span><span>  vegetables,  they  promised,  but  withheld  from  them  ;</span><span>  but  when  at  length  they  became  furious  and  riot-</span><span>  ously  clamorous,  they  were  told  that  it  had  been</span><span>  determined  by  a  board  that  2  oz.  of  salt  pork  was</span><span>  equivalent  to  8  oz.  of  flour  !  (the  ration  issued</span><span>  instead  of  peas)  ;  and  that  this  would  accordingly</span><span>  be  issued  to  them  instead  of  the  2  lbs.  of  sweet</span><span>  potatoes,  to  which,  under  the  regulations,  they</span></p> <p><span>  were  entitled.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  utterly  impossible  to  conceive  the  state  of</span><span>  mind  in  which  the  men  are  described  to  have  been</span><span>  at  this  time  ;  such  trifling  had  really  goaded  them</span><span>  to  the  point  of  madness  ;  they  were  ready  for  any</span><span>  desperate  deed,  and  deed  alas  !  was  too  soon</span><span>  effected.  Ever  since  the  time  of  Major  Anderson</span><span>  the  prisoners  had  been  allowed  for  each  mess  a  tin</span><span>  pot  to  cook  their  potatoes,  &c,  in.  It  was  sug-</span><span>  gested  by  the  stipendiary  magistrate  that  it  would</span><span>  form  a  powerful  effect  on  the  morals  of  the  men-  .</span><span>  a  new  stage  in  our  penal  science-in  short,  power-</span><span>  fully  reformatory  in  every  way,  if  these  abomina-</span><span>  ble  kettles,  (in  which  more  mischief  was  supposed</span><span>  to  be  brewed  than  even  Macbeth's  Witches  ever</span><span>  dreamt  of)  were  taken  away,  and  therefore  simul-</span></p> <p><span>  taneously  with  an  order,  announcing  that  at</span><span>  length  the  long  expected  2  lbs.  of  potatoes  would</span><span>  be  issued  ;  if  was  added  that  on  the  evening</span><span>  previous  to  the  1st  July,  all  their  kettles  would  be</span></p> <p><span>  seized.</span></p> <p><span>  This  order  was  acted  upon  in  a  manner  which</span><span>  showed  the  men  that  the  hand  of  authority  trem-</span><span>  bled  in  the  execution  of  its  duty.  When  all  the</span><span>  prisoners  were  shut  up  in  their  wards,  except  the</span><span>  few  who  attended  school,  the  police  went  into  the</span><span>  lumber  yard  and  took  away  the  obnoxious  kettles,</span><span>  and  every  thing  belonging  to  the  prisoners  they</span><span>  could  find.  At  this  time  ""Jackey  Jackey""</span><span>  (William  Westwood,  of  some  notoriety  in  this</span><span>  colony)  was  sitting  in  school,  about  seven  o'clock,</span><span>  when  a  hand-cart  came  rattling  into  the  barrack</span><span>  yard,  and  a  crash  of  tin  vessels  was  heard.</span><span>  Jackey  Jackey  was  busy  in  the  intricacies  of  a</span><span>  sum  at  this  moment,  he  suddenly  paused-lifted</span><span>  up  his  hand  with  the  pencil  in  it,  held  it  elevated</span><span>  for  a  few  seconds,  as  it  listening  and  hesitating</span><span>  then  dashed  down  the  pencil-pushed  the  slate  off</span><span>  the  table  with  a  violent  movement-and  deliber-</span><span>  ately  folding  his  arms,  as  if  he  had  finally  made</span><span>  up  his  mind,  remained  buried  in  thought  the  rest</span><span>  of  the  evening.  Every  man  followed  his  example,</span><span>  and  sat  whispering  until  the  school  broke  up.</span></p> <p><span>  The  following  morning  the  men  were  all  mus-</span><span>  tered  for  prayers-a  practice  but  recently  intro-</span><span>  duced-(nothing  can  be  more  disgraceful  than  the</span><span>  former  neligence  in  this  respect)-,  and  during  the</span><span>  service  a  murmuring  sort  of  sound  was  heard</span><span>  passing  from  bench  to  bench.  It  has  since  been</span><span>  surmised  that  this  was  a  signal  for  the  indiscri-</span><span>  minate  slaughter  of  the  officers  present  ;  but  no-</span><span>  thing  was  at  that  time  attempted.  After  prayers</span><span>  they  all  went  into  the  lumber-yard  and  found  the</span><span>  tins  gone.  A  short  pause  ensued,  and  then  they</span><span>  all  marched  back  again,  five  or  six  deep,  to  the</span><span>  Barrack-yard,  in  perfect  silence-broke  into  the</span><span>  store,  took  out  every  vessel  in  it,  and  returned  in</span><span>  the  same  manner  to  the  lumber-yard.  As  they</span><span>  approached,  Jackey  Jackey  addressed  his  followers</span><span>  in  a  speech.  ""  Now,  my  men,""  said  he,  ""  I've</span><span>  made  up  my  mind  to  bear  this  oppression  no</span><span>  longer  ;  but  remember,  I'm  going  to  the  gallows,</span><span>  if  any  man  therefore  funks,  let  him  stand  but  of</span><span>  the  way  !  Come  on.""  A  loud  cheer  followed</span><span>  from  his  desperate  followers.  A  policeman,  named</span><span>  Morris  was  in  the  archway,  Jackey  Jackey  with</span><span>  an  immense  bludgeon,  others  with  sticks,  one  man</span><span>  with  a  reaping-hook,  and  another  with  a  pitch-</span><span>  fork,  rushed  -upon  the  unfortunate  man,  and</span><span>  knocked  him  down-he  struggled,  and  got  into  the</span><span>  room  behind  him  ;  Jackey  Jackey  followed  him,</span><span>  and  beat  his  head  to  pieces.  The  men,  furious  by</span><span>  the  taste  of  blood,  then  proceeded  to  the  cook-</span><span>  house,  where  Stephen  Smith,  the  police  runner,</span><span>  was.  The  same  murderous  villain  rushed  on  him</span><span>  also,  when  poor  Smith,  who  was  formerly  much</span><span>  liked  by  the  prisoners,  cried  out  most  piteously,</span><span>  ""  for  God's  sake  don't  hurt  me  Jackey  !  remember</span><span>  my  poor  wife  and  children  !""  ""  D-n  your  wife</span><span>  and  children,""  was  the  horrible  reply,  accom-</span><span>  panied  by  a  blow  which  beat  in  poor  Smith's  eye,</span><span>  and  the  side  of  his  face.  His  shrieks  for  help</span><span>  were  terrific  ;  but  in  a  second  or  two  his  cries</span><span>  were  over  for  ever.  From  the  cook-house  they</span><span>  proceeded  towards  the  Police-house  at  the  Barrack</span><span>  gate.  At  the  corner  of  the  road,  Price,  overseer</span><span>  of  work,  and  a  man  named  Ingram,  were  standing</span><span>  -Jackey  Jackey  mate  a  furious  rush  at  Price,</span><span>  and  aimed  a  deadly  blow  at  him,  but  Price  stooped,</span><span>  and  the  blow  fell  upon  Ingram,  nearly  killing  him.</span><span>  The  mob  came  rushing  on  with  such  violence  that</span><span>  Westwood  was  pushed  forward,  and  Price  escaped</span><span>  he  knows  not  how,  and  ran  for  the  soldiers.</span></p> <p><span>  The  great  object  of  the  mob  at  this  time  seems</span><span>  to  have  been  to  seize  the  stipendiary  magistrate,</span><span>  Mr.  Barrow,  who  usually  sat  at  six  o'clock  every</span><span>  morning  to  try  cases.</span></p> <p><span>  Most  providentially  he  was  this  morning  on  a</span><span>  board  of  survey,  and  so  escaped.  The  beach  guard</span><span>  seeing  the  mob  approaching,  advanced,  and  form-</span><span>  ing  near  the  gaol,  drove  the  rioters  back.  They</span><span>  then  ran  towards  Government  House,  and  on  their</span><span>  way  Westwood  stopped  at  the  lime-kiln,  and  enter-</span><span>  ed  the  hut  there  with  an  axe,  which  he  had  by</span><span>  this  time  obtained.  Two  policemen,  Dinon  and</span><span>  Saxton,  were  in  bed.  The  former  was  actually</span><span>  asleep  when  the  cowardly  villain  drove  in  his  skull</span><span>  by  a  blow  of  the  axe,  and  Saxton  only  opened  his</span><span>  eyes  to  see  his  death-blow  fall  from  the  hand  of</span><span>  the  same  monster  ;  the  wounds  were  most  appalling</span><span>  ones-the  walls  of  the  room  were  scattered  with</span><span>  brains  and  blood.</span></p> <p><span>  Westwood,  after  this  atrocity,  coolly  lighted  his</span><span>  pipe,  and  after  a  few  puffs,  shouted  out,  ""  Now</span><span>  for  the  Christ  killer,""  and  a  cry  was  immediately</span><span>  raised,  ""  To  Barrow's,  to  Barrow's""  Happily</span><span>  the  alarm  given  by  Price  had  roused  the  military,</span><span>  who  were  now  under  arms,  and  at  this  critical</span><span>  juncture,  the  soldiers  were  seen  running  down  the</span><span>  Water-road  ;  the  rioters  instantly  retreated  to  the</span><span>  Lumber-yard-Westwood  loudly  denouncing  their</span><span>  cowardice.  The  place  was  surrounded,  and  after</span><span>  much  difficulty  and  delay,  the  ringleaders  were</span><span>  seized,  and  about  sixty  left  to  be  tried  by  a  special</span><span>  Court  of  Criminal  Sessions.</span></p> <p><span>  So  rests  for  the  present  this  fearful  tragedy,</span><span>  unparalleled  in  heartless  atrocity.  How  much  of</span><span>  its  guilt  may  be  justly  traced  to  the  hands  and</span><span>  heads  to  which  the  supreme  authority  was  en-</span><span>  trusted,  it  is  hard  to  say  ;  but  never  was  a  greater</span><span>  blunder  committed,  or  one  which  has  been  followed</span><span>  by  more  disastrous  consequences,  than  the  ap-</span><span>  pointment  of  the  late  Superintendent  to  a  post</span><span>  requiring  so  much  intelligence  and  firmness,</span><span>  tempered  indeed  by  an  enlightened  humanity.  We</span><span>  ardently  hope  that  discipline  may  be  restored,  and</span><span>  sounder  principles  be  acted  upon.  Without  ex-</span><span>  tenuating  in  the  most  remote  degree  the  enormities</span><span>  of  which  the  diabolical  perpetrators  of  these  atro-</span><span>  cities  have  been  guilty,  we  must  still  commiserate</span><span>  the  fate  of  better  men  whose  feelings  have  been</span><span>  insulted,  who  have  been  bullied  and  trifled  with,</span><span>  harassed  and  cheated  by  men  who  may  boast  of</span><span>  their  savings,  but  who  will  not  soon  shake  off  the</span><span>  odium  of  their  doings.  We  trust  again,  we  say,</span><span>  that  order  may  be  established  in  this  after  all  most</span><span>  horrible  plague  spot  ;  but  it  is  to  be  feared,  that</span><span>  like  the  tiger  which  has  once  drunk  blood,  it  will</span><span>  be  long  before  these  wretched  men,  cooped  up  so</span><span>  unnaturally,  and  lacerated  in  mind  and  body,  will</span><span>  forget  the  power  for  mischief  they  have  discerned</span><span>  by  these  acts  they  really  possess.-S.

Harris</span></p> <p><span>  Proposed  by  Mr.  Pickering  ;  seconded  by  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Phelan  -</span></p> <p><span>  1st.  That  this  meeting  has  heard  with  consider-</span><span>  able  surprise  that  the  Colonial  Secretary  is  re-</span><span>  ported  to  have  expressed  the  following  words,  in</span><span>  his  place,  in  the  Legislative  Council,  upon  the  dis-</span><span>  cussion  of  the  erection,  of  a  Custom-house  at  this</span><span>  port-""  The  site,  it  appeared,  had  not  been  deter-</span><span>  mined  upon,  and  there  were  conflicting  opinions.</span><span>  At  Moreton  Bay,  there  were  some  who  wished  to</span><span>  have  the  Custom-house  at  Brisbane-others  at</span><span>  Cleveland  Point.  The  Police  Magistrate,  however,</span><span>  who  was  known  as  a  marine  surveyor,  was  at  pre-</span><span>  sent  engaged  in  fixing  the  site  of  a  commercial</span><span>  town  ;  for  Brisbane  could  not  long  be  a  commer-</span><span>  cial  town,  in  consequence  of  the  bar,  which  pre-</span><span>  vented  vessels  of  any  size  going  up.  At  Cleveland</span><span>  Point,  however,  there  was  deep  water  and  very</span><span>  good  shelter  for  shipping.""  Because  upon  the</span><span>  faith  of  the  Government  having  previously  fixed</span><span>  upon  Brisbane  as  the  seat  of  Government  for  these</span><span>  northern  districts,  large  sums  have  been  laid  out</span><span>  by  us  in  the  purchase  of  land,  and  erecting  build-</span><span>  ings  thereon,  and  now  view  with  apprehension</span><span>  any  attempt  to  remove  the  Government  Establish-</span><span>  ment  to  any  other  locality.-Carried.</span></p> <p><span>  Proposed  by  Mr.  Richardson  ;  seconded  by  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Bow</span></p> <p><span>  2nd.  That  it  being  the  opinion  of  this  meeting,</span><span>  in  conjunction  with  several  practical  persons,  well</span><span>  acquainted  with  the  port  of  Moreton  Bay,  the</span><span>  present  town  of  Brisbane  is  in  every  point  of  view</span><span>  the  most  eligible  site  for  the  shipping  port  of  these</span><span>  districts  ;  and,  therefore,  resolve  that  a  Memorial</span><span>  be  drawn  up,  and  presented  to  His  Excellency  the</span><span>  Governor,  praying  that  the  proposed  Custom-</span><span>  house  be  erected  at  Brisbane.-Carried.</span></p> <p><span>  The  following  Memorial  was  then  submitted  to</span><span>  the  meeting,  for  their  approval  :-</span></p> <p><span>  To  His  Excellency  Sir  Charles  Augustus</span></p> <p><span>  Fitz  Roy,  Knight,  Governor-in-Chief  of</span><span>  the  Colony  of  New  South  Wales,  and  its</span><span>  dependencies,</span></p> <p><span>  The  respectful  Memorial  of  the  Inhabi-</span></p> <p><span>  tants  of  North  and  South  Brisbane,</span><span>  in  the  County  of  Stanley,</span><span>  Humbly  Sheweth  -</span></p> <p><span>  That  since  the  Proclamation,  published  in  Janu-</span><span>  ary,  1842,  throwing  the  district  of  Moreton  Bay</span><span>  open  for  location,  and  the  first  Government  Land</span><span>  Sale,  in  July  of  that  year,  town  and  suburban</span><span>  allotments  in  North  and  South  Brisbane,  have  been</span><span>  purchased  from  the  Government,  to  the  amount  of</span><span>  about  £20,000,  the  occupiers  of  which  have,  upon</span><span>  the  Government  having  established  Brisbane  as</span><span>  the  seat  of  the  Government,  and  the  shipping  port</span><span>  of  Moreton  Bay,  laid  out  considerable  sums  in</span><span>  buildings,  and  other  improvements.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  Sydney  Morning  Herald,  of  the  18th  of</span><span>  October  last,  the  honorable  the  Colonial  Secretary</span><span>  is  reported  to  have  made  a  speech,  in  his  place  in</span><span>  the  Legislative  Council,  to  the  following  effect,  in</span><span>  reference  to  the  Custom-house,  at  Moreton  Bay,</span><span>  viz.  :-""  That  the  site,  it  appeared,  had  not  been</span><span>  determined  upon,  and  there  were  conflicting</span><span>  opinions.  At  Moreton  Bay,  there  were  some  who</span><span>  wished  to  have  the  Custom-house  at  Brisbane  -</span><span>  others  at  Cleveland  Point.  The  Police  Magistrate,</span><span>  however,  who  was  known  as  a  marine  surveyor,</span><span>  was  .at  present  engaged  in  fixing  the  site  for  a</span><span>  commercial  town  ;  for  Brisbane  could  not  long  be</span><span>  the  commercial  town,  in  consequence  of  the  Bar</span><span>  which  prevented  vessels  of  any  size  going  up.  At</span><span>  Cleveland  Point,  however,  there  was  deep  water,</span><span>  and  very  good  shelter  for  shipping.""  With  re-</span><span>  ference  to  the  previous  assertions,  your  memorial-</span><span>  ists  would  most  earnestly  beg  to  contradict  such</span><span>  erroneous  opinions.  The  inhabitants  of  Brisbane</span><span>  being  unanimous  that  Brisbane  is  the  most  eligible</span><span>  shipping  port  ;  neither  is  the  Police  Magistrate</span><span>  employed  laying  out  the  site  of  any  other  commer-</span><span>  cial  town  ;  and  so  far  from  the  present  town  of</span><span>  Brisbane  being  abandoned  as  a  commercial  port,</span><span>  every  day  brings  out  more  fully  its  advantages  for</span><span>  commercial  purposes.</span></p> <p><span>  Your  memorialists  would,  therefore,  under  these</span><span>  circumstances,  beg  most  respectfully  to  state  the</span><span>  following  facts,  for  your  Excellency's  mature</span><span>  consideration,  in  refutation  of  such  assertions  :</span></p> <p><span>  First.  That  two  large  townships  have  been  laid</span><span>  out  in  North  and  South  Brisbane,  a  considerable</span><span>  portion  of  which  has  been  sold,  and  an  estimated</span><span>  sum  of  £30,000  laid  out  upon  buildings  and  other</span><span>  improvements.</span></p> <p><span>  Secondly.  That  the  situations  of  the  townships,</span><span>  on  the  north  and  South  banks  of  the  river,  have</span><span>  been  most  judiciously  selected  for  commercial</span><span>  purposes,  there  being  deep  water  close  to  the</span><span>  shore,  and  clear  anchorage  in  the  stream  for</span><span>  every  description  of  vessel.</span></p> <p><span>  Thirdly.  The  only  impediment  to  the  navigation</span></p> <p><span>  of  this  fine  river,  the  bar  which,  in  the  opinion  of</span><span>  practical  men,  could  easily  be  removed  by  the  aid</span><span>  of  a  dredging  machine,  as  there  is  at  present</span><span>  upwards  of  ten  feet  six  inches  at  high  water</span><span>  spring  tides,  and  which  bar  could  be  easily</span><span>  deepened  at  comparatively  small  expense.  That</span><span>  until  this  object  can  be  effected,  the  best  anchorage</span><span>  in  Moreton  Bay,  for  vessels  shipping  wool,  is  at</span><span>  the  mouth  of  the  Brisbane  River,  where  from  the</span><span>  year  1832,  the  whole  of  the  supplies  for  the  Penal</span><span>  Establishment  of  Moreton  Bay,  were  transhipped</span><span>  from  the  Government  vessels,  and  a  large  quantity</span><span>  of  maize  shipped  for  Sydney  and  Norfolk  Island,</span><span>  as  also  wool  for  England,  while  lying  at  the</span><span>  anchorage  known  as  the  ""  White  Buoy,""  at  the</span><span>  mouth  of  the  river-and  that  no  instance  of  loss,</span><span>  or  damage  of  such  goods  and  cargo,  has  at  any</span></p> <p><span>  time  occurred.</span></p> <p><span>  Fourthly.  That  the  capital  required  for  the</span><span>  erection  of  wharves,  .stores,  Government  offices,</span><span>  &c  at  Cleveland  Point  for  the  convenience  of</span><span>  shipping  would  be  enormous,  a  comparatively</span><span>  small  portion  of  which  sum  expended  in  deepening</span><span>  the  Bar  would  make  Brisbane  a  most  available</span><span>  shipping  port,  where  Military  Barracks  and  large</span><span>  Government  Buildings  are  already  erected-like-</span><span>  wise  suitable  buildings  for  trade-and  stores  and</span><span>  wharves  for  the  convenience  of  shipping.</span></p> <p><span>  Fifthly.  That  the  anchorage  at  the  mouth  of</span><span>  the  river  is  the  best  in  Moreton  Bay,  and  the  most</span><span>  central  position  for  the  shipment  of  wool,  while</span><span>  the  roadstead  at  Cleveland  Point  is  greatly  ex-</span><span>  posed  to  the  north-east  winds  which  prevail  during</span><span>  the  shipping  season,  and  is  also  greatly  affected</span><span>  by  a  strong  adverse  tide-a  combination  of  cir-</span><span>  cumstances  which  would  render  shipment  of</span><span>  produce  from  thence  both  dangerous  and  difficult.</span></p> <p><span>  Sixthly.  That  the  waters  of  the  Brisbane  are</span><span>  now  navigated  by  steam  to  the  distance  of  seventy</span><span>  miles  from  the  entrance  of  the  river;  and  the</span><span>  townships  of  North  and  South  Brisbane,  from</span><span>  their  eligible  position,  must  eventually  become</span><span>  the  seat  of  commerce  for  the  increasing  districts</span><span>  of  Moreton  Bay,  Darling  Downs,  the  Boyne,  and</span><span>  the  Heads  of  the  Clarence.</span></p> <p><span>  That  your  memorialists  in  stating  the  above</span><span>  facts  to  Your  Excellency,  would  beg  most  respect-</span><span>  fully  to  pray  that  Your  Excellency  will  be  pleased</span><span>  to  take  this  representation  into  consideration,</span><span>  with  the  view  to  a  full  enquiry  into  the  statements</span><span>  contained  in  this  memorial  ;  and  we  feel  confident</span><span>  that  in  such  case,  the  weight  of  evidence  will  be</span><span>  in  favour  of  retaining  the  Customs  and  other</span><span>  Government  Establishments  at  Brisbane,  the  re-</span><span>  moval  of  which  elsewhere  will  be  the  total  ruin  of</span><span>  your  memorialists.</span></p> <p><span>  And  your  memorialists  further  pray  that  Your</span><span>  Excellency  will  direct  that  a  Custom-house  may</span><span>  be  built  as  early  as  practicable  at  Brisbane.</span></p> <p><span>  And  your  memorialists  as  in  duty  bound  will</span></p> <p><span>  ever  pray,  &c.</span></p> <p><span>  Proposed  by  Mr.  Harris  ;  seconded  by.  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Petrie-</span></p> <p><span>  3rd;  That  the  Memorial  now  read  be  adopted  by</span><span>  this  meeting  ;  and  that  the  same  be  placed  before</span><span>  every  householder  in  these  townships  for  their</span><span>  signatures,  and  afterwards  transmitted  to  His  Ex-</span><span>  cellency  the  Governor.-Carried.</span></p> <p><span>  Proposed  by  Mr.  Gill  ;  seconded  by  Mr.</span><span>  Richardson-</span></p> <p><span>  4th.

The  inhabitants  of  Brisbane</span><span>  being  unanimous  that  Brisbane  is  the  most  eligible</span><span>  shipping  port  ;  neither  is  the  Police  Magistrate</span><span>  employed  laying  out  the  site  of  any  other  commer-</span><span>  cial  town  ;  and  so  far  from  the  present  town  of</span><span>  Brisbane  being  abandoned  as  a  commercial  port,</span><span>  every  day  brings  out  more  fully  its  advantages  for</span><span>  commercial  purposes.</span></p> <p><span>  Your  memorialists  would,  therefore,  under  these</span><span>  circumstances,  beg  most  respectfully  to  state  the</span><span>  following  facts,  for  your  Excellency's  mature</span></p> <p><span>  consideration,  in  refutation  of  such  assertions  :</span></p> <p><span>  First.  That  two  large  townships  have  been  laid</span><span>  out  in  North  and  South  Brisbane,  a  considerable</span><span>  portion  of  which  has  been  sold,  and  an  estimated</span><span>  sum  of  £30,000  laid  out  upon  buildings  and  other</span></p> <p><span>  improvements.</span></p> <p><span>  Secondly.  That  the  situations  of  the  townships,</span><span>  on  the  north  and  south  banks  of  the  river,  have</span><span>  been  most  judiciously  selected  for  commercial</span><span>  purposes,  there  being  deep  water  close  to  the</span><span>  shore,  and  clear  anchorage  in  the  stream  for</span><span>  every  description  of  vessel.</span></p> <p><span>  Thirdly.  The  only  impediment  to  the  navigation</span></p> <p><span>  of  this  fine  river,  is  a  bar  which,  in  the  opinion  of  -</span><span>  practical  men,  could  easily  be  removed  by  the  aid</span><span>  of  a  dredging  machine,  as  there  is  at  present</span><span>  upwards  of  ten  feet  six  inches  at  high  water</span><span>  spring  tides,  and  which  bar  could  be  easily</span><span>  deepened  at  comparatively  small  expense.  That</span><span>  until  this  object  can  be  effected,  the  best,  anchorage</span><span>  in  Moreton  Bay,  for  vessels  shipping  wool,  is  at</span><span>  the  mouth  of  the  Brisbane  River,  where  from  the</span><span>  year  1832,  the  whole  of  the  supplies  for  the  Penal</span><span>  Establishment  of  Moreton  Bay,  were  transhipped</span><span>  from  the  Government  vessels,  and  large  quantity</span><span>  of  maize  shipped  for  Sydney  and  Norfolk  Island,</span><span>  as  also  wool  for  England,  while  lying  at  the</span><span>  anchorage  known  as  the  ""  White  Buoy,""  at  the</span><span>  mouth  of  the  river  and  that  no  instance  of  loss,</span><span>  or  damage  of  such  goods  and  cargo,  has  at  any</span></p> <p><span>  time  occurred.</span></p> <p><span>  Fourthly.  That  the  capital  required  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  erection  of  wharves,  stores,  Government  offices,</span><span>  &c.  at  Cleveland  Point  for  the  convenience  of</span><span>  Shipping  would  -be  enormous,  a  comparatively</span><span>  small  portion  of  which  sum  expended  in  deepening</span><span>  the  Bar  would  make  Brisbane  a  most  available</span><span>  shipping  port,  where  Military  Barracks  and  large</span><span>  Government  Buildings  are  already  erected-like-</span><span>  wise  suitable  buildings  for  trade-and  stores  and</span><span>  wharves  for  the  convenience  of  shipping.</span></p> <p><span>  Fifthly.  That  the  anchorage  at  the  mouth  of</span><span>  the  river  is  the  best  in  Moreton  Bay,  and  the  most</span><span>  central  position  for  the  shipment  of  wool,  while</span><span>  the  roadstead  at  Cleveland  Point  is  greatly  ex-</span><span>  posed  to  the  north-east  winds  which  prevail  during</span><span>  the  shipping  season,  and  is  also  greatly  affected</span><span>  by  a  strong  adverse  tide-a  combination  of  cir-</span><span>  cumstances  which  would  render  shipment  of</span><span>  produce  from  thence  both  dangerous  and  difficult.</span></p> <p><span>  Sixthly.  That  the  waters  of  the  Brisbane  are</span><span>  now  navigated  by  steam  to  the  distance  of  seventy</span><span>  miles  from  the  entrance  of  the  river;  and  the</span><span>  townships  of  North  and  South  Brisbane,  from</span><span>  their  eligible  position,  must  eventually  become</span><span>  the  seat  of  commerce  for  the  increasing  districts</span><span>  of  Moreton  Bay,  Darling  Downs,  the  Boyne,  and</span></p> <p><span>  the  heads  of  the  Clarence.</span></p> <p><span>  That  your  memorialists  in  Stating  the  above</span><span>  facts  to  Your  Excellency,  would  beg  most  respect-</span><span>  fully  to  pray  that  Your  Excellency  will  be  pleased</span><span>  to  take  this  representation  into  consideration,</span><span>  with  the  view  to  a  full  enquiry  into  the  statements</span><span>  contained  in  this  memorial  ;  and  we  feel  confident</span><span>  that  in  such  case,  the  weight  of  evidence  will  be</span><span>  in  favour  of  retaining  tile  Customs  and  other</span><span>  Government  Establishments  at  Brisbane,  the  re-</span><span>  moval  of  which  elsewhere  will  be  the  total  ruin  of</span><span>  your  memorialists.</span></p> <p><span>  And  your  memorialists  further  pray  that  Your</span><span>  Excellency  will  direct  that  a  Custom-house  may</span><span>  be  built  as  early  as  practicable  at  Brisbane.</span></p> <p><span>  And  your  memorialists  as  in  duty  bound  will</span></p> <p><span>  ever  pray,  &c.</span></p> <p><span>  Proposed  by  Mr.  Harris  ;  seconded  by  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Petrie-</span></p> <p><span>  3rd.  That  the  Memorial  now  read  be  adopted  by</span><span>  this  meeting  ;  and  that  the  same  be  placed  before</span><span>  every  householder  in  these  townships  for  their</span><span>  signatures,  and  afterwards  transmitted  to  His  Ex-</span><span>  cellency  the  Governor.-Carried.</span></p> <p><span>  Proposed  by  Mr.  Gill  ;  seconded  by  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Richardson</span></p> <p><span>  4th.  That  the  proceedings  of  this  meeting  be</span><span>  advertised  in  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier  and</span><span>  Sydney  Morning  Herald.-Carried.</span></p> <p><span>  RICHARD  J.
