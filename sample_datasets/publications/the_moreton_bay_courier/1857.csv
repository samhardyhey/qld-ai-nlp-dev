Let  any  ono  take  up  tho  Government</span><span>  Gatette  and  examino  the  report  of  the  Emigra-</span><span>  tion  Board,  they  will  find  that  in  about  two</span><span>  thirds  of  the  arrivais  throughout  tho  year  tho</span><span>  .ingle  women  are  marked  ""bad  solection,""  ""un-</span><span>  suitable  for  the  colony,""  ""  not  Rtiitablo  for  sor-</span><span>  tants.""  Now  as  theie  are  all,  or  nearly  nil,</span><span>  married  in  a  comparatively  short  poriod  after</span><span>  their  arrival,  does  it  not  as  a  matter  of  course</span><span>  follow  that  many  a  man  makes  a  ""  bad  selection""</span><span>  for  a  wife,  and  finds  a  most  unsuitable  mothor  for</span><span>  his  children.  Hence  marriages  ate  no  silken  tics,</span><span>  hut  iron  bonds  eating  to  their  heart's  core  ;  and</span><span>  by  ita  weight  crushing  the  hopes  and  onergies  of</span><span>  both  :  and  while  tho  result  is  sometimes  desertion</span><span>  or  uQfiiitbfulness,  it  is  oftoner  the  oause  of  the</span><span>  husband  becoming  broken-spirited,  taking  to</span><span>  brutal  Indulgence,  and  ending  in  besotted  drun-</span><span>  kenness  ;  and  the  wife  becoming  cross,  dirty,</span><span>  and  sluttish,  and  sometimes  following  the  example</span><span>  of  her  husband.  Where  tho  atmosphere  of  home</span><span>  (wah  as  it  ii)  is  thus  impregnated  with  tho  ole</span><span>  faesU  of  discord  and  vice,  the  children  will  grow</span><span>  tip  the  Wfltima  of  rudo  and  selfish  passions,  and</span><span>  with  cross  and  gnarled  tempers  they  will  go  ont</span></p> <p><span>  into  tho  world,</span></p> <p><span>  But,  Sir,  lot  it  »ot  be  thought  that  I  blame  the</span><span>  waiker  sex  for  all  the  social  misarios  that  rankle</span><span>  and  fester  in  society.  Very  for  from  it,  But  it</span><span>  is  regarding  that  sox  that  I  am  writing.  It  is</span><span>  because  their  influence  is  far  greater  at  home  and</span><span>  among  their  children  than  a  husband's  influence.</span><span>  It  is  because  by  tbair  example  they  aro  a  law  to</span><span>  their  families,  where  their  authority  is  of  no  uso</span><span>  unless  they  can  inspire  rospaot  by  their  aminblo</span><span>  neu  and""  usefulness.

No  doubt  the  servant  that</span><span>  boiled  the  sandglass  with  the  eggs  for  breakfast</span><span>  the  other  day,  will  be  aware  not  to  make  the  sarna</span><span>  mistake  in  futuro,  and  that  the  other  girl  who</span><span>  tried  to  bake  the  cabbage  with  the  joint  for  the</span><span>  dinner  will  also  know  better  for  timo  to  como.</span><span>  Yet  these,  and  other  not  much  less  ludicrous  mis-</span><span>  takes,  shows  the  necessity  for  some  means  being</span><span>  provided  to  teach  the  requirements  of  domestic</span><span>  life,  and  whore  can  they  loam  it  among  us  at</span><span>  present?  Many  a  servant  girl  would  instt  act  her-</span><span>  self  if  she  could  obtain  that  instruction  in  a  suit-</span><span>  able  way  by  paying  for  it.  And  as  we  have  young</span><span>  men's  societies,  and  associations  for  their  improve-</span><span>  ment,  why  should  young  women  be  neglected,  on</span><span>  whom  the  happiness  of  young  men  so  much</span><span>  depend  Î</span></p> <p><span>  It  has  been  sometimes  a  question  with  debating</span><span>  societies  ""  should  women  get  the  same  education</span><span>  that  men  get?''  I  would  say  they  should  have  tho</span><span>  samo  education  that  men  should  get.  Their</span><span>  influença  on  our  happiness  is  really  incalculable,</span><span>  when  we  consider  that  many  of  those  young^</span><span>  creatures  wero  brought  up  in  institutions,  and</span><span>  never  knew  what  a  home  of  any  kind  requires.</span><span>  Many  of  thom  have  no  relation  in  this  distant</span><span>  land.  Of  how  mnoh  importance  then  is  it  to  have</span><span>  some  means  of  instruction  within  their  reach,</span><span>  so  that  they  may  have  some  further  ideas  of  the</span><span>  duties  of  life  than  merely  to  catch  a  husband  and</span><span>  get  a  legal  claim  to  his  protection  and  support?</span></p> <p><span>  It  does  not  matter  by  what  name  the  required</span><span>  institutions  should  be  known,  suffice  it  to  say  they</span><span>  aie  wanted.  Not  only  would  servants  pay  for</span><span>  their  own  instruction,  but  parents  wonld  also</span><span>  send  their  daughters  to  such  seminaries,  and</span><span>  many  a  joung  man  would  send  the  future  partner</span><span>  of  his  life  to  acquire  some  of  the  many  lessons</span><span>  which  she  as  a  rational  being  will  find  necessary</span><span>  in  her  social  capacity,  or  for  the  advancement  of</span><span>  her  intellectual  and  moral  natuie.

This</span><span>  justice  being  done  to  me,  I  cannot  deny  my  o,vn</span><span>  fallibility.

It  is  highly  gratifying</span><span>  to  rae  to  [earn,  that  the  measures  which  I  had  the</span><span>  honor  to  introduce,  were  considered  by  you  as  of</span><span>  ""  a  highly  beneficial  tendency,  and  that  I  have</span><span>  appeared  ansious  to  redeem  roy  pledges  at  any</span></p> <p><span>  rate.""</span></p> <p><span>  Rut,  Sir,  I  must  regret  that  you  still  speak  of</span><span>  my  vote  on  the  buundary  question  as  n  faux</span><span>  pas  on  my  part.  If  I  have  ""  not  yet  put  myself</span><span>  right  with  my  constituents""  on  that  point,  it  may</span><span>  be  attributed  to  my  wane  of  ability,  hut  I  lind</span><span>  thought  that  the  Rev.  Dr.  Lang,  whose  intelli-</span><span>  gent  zeal  in  the  cause  of  Separation  is  universally</span><span>  acknowledged,  had  effectually  performed  thnt</span><span>  service  for  me.  The  reverend  gentleman,  in  a</span><span>  lecture  delivered  in  Bii&b.me  on  the  11th  April</span><span>  last,  as  reported  in  your  journal,  thus  speaks  of</span></p> <p><span>  tho  resolutions  for  which  I  voted  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""  I  examined  thom  very  carefully,  and  found</span><span>  Hist  thero  was  really  nothing  in  them  that  could</span><span>  give  tho  slightest  uneasiness  to  an  inhabitant  of</span><span>  yonr'district.""  Before  recording  my  vote  for  those</span><span>  resolutions,  I  also,  like  Dr.  Lang,  ""examined</span><span>  them  very  carefully,""  and  the  conclusion  I  carne</span><span>  to  was  tho  very  samo  as  that  arrived  at  by  the</span><span>  Doctor,  when  ho  told  his  audience  in  Brisbane</span><span>  that  ""  there  was  nothing  in  fact,  that  you  could</span><span>  not  embody  in  a  potition  of  your  own.""</span></p> <p><span>  I  would  invite  yon,  Sir,  and  your  readers,  to  a</span><span>  calm  re-perusal  of  the  resolutions,  which  I  append</span><span>  hereto,  and  to  consider  whether  the  impression</span><span>  made  upon  the  mind3  of  Dr.  Lang  and  mysolf  was</span><span>  not  natural  and  reisonablo.  I  freely  acknowledge,</span><span>  that  in  the  course  of  the  debate,  ronny  of  tho</span><span>  members  wandered  far  from  the  question  before</span><span>  the  House.  Tho  language  of  some  of  these  gen-</span><span>  tlemen  was  such  as  to  provoko  strong  feelings  of</span><span>  indignation  on  tho  part  of  tha  inhabitants  of  your</span><span>  '  district.  Instead  of  confining  themselves  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  true  question-namely,  whether  the  inhabitants</span><span>  of  New  England  and  the  Claronce.should  bo  con-</span><span>  sulted  as  to  the  government  under  which  they</span><span>  preforred  to  live-the  gentlemen  alluded  to,  con-</span><span>  temptuously  scouted  tho  idoa  of  Separation  alto-</span><span>  gether,  and  used  to  Moreton  Bay  and  its  inhabit-</span><span>  ants,  language  which  from  personal  experience,  1</span><span>  knew  to  bo  that  of  unjust  disparagement.</span></p> <p><span>  It  was  thus  very  natural,  that  in  tho  indigna-</span><span>  tion  of  the  moment,  readers  in  your  district  should</span><span>  not  clearly  distinguish  between  those  obnoxious</span><span>  speechos,  and  the  simple  equity  of  tho  principles</span><span>  laid  down  in  the  resolutions.  It  is  quite  possible</span><span>  that  many  of  my  constituents  may,  for  a  time,</span><span>  have  identified  me  with  those  violent  Phillipies,</span><span>  in  whioh  my  voioo  bad  no  part,  and  with  which</span><span>  my  mind  had  no  sympathy.  But  I  erahraco  this</span><span>  opportunity  of  recording  my  utter  repudiation  of</span><span>  the  unwarrantable  language  used  by  some  of  thoso</span><span>  speakers.  Indignant  ns  1  was  to  bear  it,  I  was</span><span>  precluded  from  replying  by  having  apokon  in  tho</span><span>  early  part  of  the  debate.  I  therelore  endeavored,</span><span>  na  I  invariably  do  on  such  occasions,  to  dispol</span><span>  from  my  mind  all  extraneous  matter,  and  to  con-</span><span>  fine  my  attention  to  tho  simple  question  before</span><span>  the  Hjuso.  Now  that  you  and  my  constituents</span><span>  seem  disposed  lo  do  me  justice,  I  will  candidly</span><span>  confess  this  :  that,  though  I  saw  nothing  in  the</span><span>  resolutions,  but  what  was  strictly  consistent  with</span><span>  my  own  good  faith,  as  well  as  with  justice  and</span><span>  equity,  jet,  if  anything  could  have  induced  me</span><span>  to  vo\o  against  them,  it  would  have  been  the  in</span><span>  oxomablo  language  of  some  of  the  speeches  in</span><span>  their  favor.  But  the  resolutions  alono  will  be</span><span>  considered  by  her  Majesty«  Government,  and,</span><span>  as  Dr.  Lang  veryjustty  observes,  they  contain</span><span>  ""nothing  that  you'could  not  embody  in  a  petition</span><span>  of  your  own.""  The  speoches  will  certainly  nover</span><span>  bo  read  by  the  Queen's  Ministers,  and  havo  only</span><span>  Berved  to  raiso  feelings  of  .indignation,  which,</span><span>  although  well  merited,  aro  deeply  to  bo  deplored.</span></p> <p><span>  With  referenco  to  the  Requisition  that  was  ad-</span><span>  dressed  to  me,  1  did  at  first  intend  to  havo  des-</span><span>  troyed  it  ;  but,  on  reflection,  there  appeared  some</span><span>  force  in  tho  argument,  that  it  was  to  some  extent</span><span>  a  public  documont,  and  ought  not  to  be  so  dis-</span><span>  posed  of.  I  was  further  indnood  to  preservo  it</span><span>  after  an  examination  of  tho  signatures,  whereby</span><span>  I  perceived  that  unjustifiable  means  had  been  re-</span><span>  sorted  to  for  the  purpose  of  increasing  the  num-</span><span>  ber  of  names  appended.</span></p> <p><span>  I  have  the  documont  now  in  my  possosnion,  and</span><span>  can  produce  it  if  necessary  in  proof  of  the  accu-</span><span>  racy  of  what  I  now  assert.  Eighty-eight  of  the</span><span>  names  are  not  on  the  olectoral  list,  several  names</span><span>  ure  signed  twice,  many  names  follow  oaeh  otbor</span><span>  in  the  same  handwriting.  This  has  been  defended</span><span>  by  the  assertion  that  the  names  were  written  with</span><span>  tne  authority  of  the  owners  :  but  the  circumstance</span><span>  appeared  auspicious,  and  more  especially  from</span><span>  what  I  am  now  about  to  mention.  A  gentleman</span><span>  very  long  resident  in  your  district,  addressed  me,</span><span>  on  a  matter  of  private  business,  and  I  roplied  by</span><span>  expressing  my  surpriso  that  bo  should  do  so,  as</span><span>  his  name  was  appended  to  a  document,  which  ac-</span><span>  cused  me  of  no  less  a  orimo  than  that  of  breaking</span><span>  my  pledge.

"<p><span>  To  the  Editor  of  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier,</span></p> <p><span>  Sir,  -In  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier  of  the  25th</span><span>  July,  I  have  noticed  a  letter  signed  Kilana,  in</span><span>  which  the  writer  states  as  follows  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""  The  committee  appointed  to  watch  over  these</span><span>  matters  immediately  put  itself  in  communication</span><span>  with  the  Member  of  the  district,  and  the  Minister</span><span>  for  Lands  and  Public  Works,  and  it  took  occasion</span><span>  from  the  late  disastrous  floods,  to  point  out  to  Mr.</span><span>  Hay  the  urgent  necessity  for  proceeding  at  once</span><span>  with  the  public  wharf,  as  the  flood  had  swept  the</span><span>  old  one  almost,  if  not  altogether  away.  Mr.  Hay</span><span>  deserves  praise  for  his  promptitude  in  this  matter.</span><span>  Immediately  on  receipt  of  this  intelligence  he</span><span>  wrote  to  Mr.  Halloran,  the  Commissioner,  ac-</span><span>  quainting  him  that  the  money  would  be  placed</span></p> <p><span>  forthwith  to  the  credit  of  the  Bench,  and  that  the</span><span>  works,  especially  the  wharf,  might  be  immediately</span><span>  proceeded  with.  Mr.  Halloran,  however,  for  some  reasons  known  only  to  himself,  did  not  apprise</span><span>  the  committee  of  this  communication,  and  the</span><span>  works  have  consequently  been  delayed,  to  the</span><span>  serious  inconvenience  and  injury  of  those  interest-</span><span>  ed.  I  shall  not  trust  myself  to  say  what  I  think</span><span>  of  the  public  officer  who  could  be  guilty  of  such</span><span>  conduct,  but  will  leave  it  to  the  public,  of  which</span><span>  Mr.  Halloran  is  the  servant,  to  say  whether,  he  is</span><span>  or  is  not  worthy  of  its  confidence.""</span></p> <p><span>  In  reply  to  which,  I  beg  simply  to  say,  that  the</span><span>  statements  of  ""Kilana""  are  false  and  malicious;</span><span>  and  that  if  he  for  one  moment  supposes  his  anony-</span><span>  mous  slanders  will  deprive  me  of  the  confidence</span><span>  of  the  Government  and  the  public,  which  I  have</span><span>  served  for  twenty-three  years,  he  will  find  himself</span><span>  greatly  disappointed.</span></p> <p><span>  The  facts  are  simply  these.  In  May  last,  during</span><span>  my  absence  in  Sydney,  the  wharf  at  Maryborough</span><span>  was  damaged  by  the  floods.  The  chairman  of</span><span>  what  is  here  called  ""The  Public  Works  Com-</span><span>  mittee,""  Mr.  Edmund  Blucher  Uhr,  reported  the</span><span>  circumstance  to  the  honorable  the  Minister  for</span><span>  Lands  and  Public  Works,  and  urged  upon  that</span><span>  officer  the  necessity  for  the  public  wharf  being  at</span><span>  once  constructed.  The  honorable  the  Minister</span><span>  immediately  replied  to  the  chairman  of  the  com-</span><span>  mittee,  (letter  dated  12th  June,  1857),  acquaint-</span><span>  ing  him  that  the  sum  of  £500,  voted  for  the  con-</span><span>  struction  of  the  wharf  at  Maryborough,  would  be</span><span>  placed  in  the  Joint  Stock  Bank  to  the  credit  of</span><span>  the  Bench  of  Magistrates,  to  enable  them  and  the</span><span>  committee  to  carry  out  the  work  in  question.  A</span><span>  similar  letter  was  addressed  to  the  Bench,  and  a</span><span>  receipt  for  the  signature  of  the  magistrates  for  the</span><span>  £500,  was  at  the  same  time  forwarded  and  a  third</span><span>  letter  to  the  same  effect  was  delivered  to  me  in</span><span>  Sydney.  The  letters  and  other  documents  for  the</span><span>  chairman  of  the  committee  and  for  the  Bench,</span><span>  were  received  in  Maryborough  by  the  chairman</span><span>  before  my  return  to  the  district  ;  and  it  was  clearly</span><span>  the  duty  of  the  chairman  to  have  acquainted  the</span><span>  committee  with  the  result  of  his  application  to  the</span><span>  honorable  the  Minister  for  Lands  and  Public</span><span>  Works,  with  which  I  had  nothing  to  do.  If  he</span><span>  neglected  to  do  so,  it  was  he  who  suppressed  the</span><span>  information,  and  is  entitled  to  the  censure.</span></p> <p><span>  I  shall  not  condescond  to  offer  any  comments</span><span>  on  ""  Kilana's""  letter.  The  attacks  of  such  pol-</span><span>  troons  (who  write  anonymously,  thereby  shewing</span><span>  that  they  are  ashamed  of  their  doings)  are  beneath</span><span>  the  contempt  of  every  honorable  man.  But  as  he</span><span>  has  brought  charges  against  me  of  an  injurious</span><span>  character,  and  which  I  can  prove  to  be  both  false</span><span>  and  malicious,  I  shall  leave  ""  Kilana""  in  the  hands</span><span>  of  my  attorney,  to  whom  I  have  written  on  the</span><span>  subject.</span></p> <p><span>  I  had  written  the  foregoing,  and  was  on  my  way</span><span>  to  the  Post-office  with  my  letter,  when  I  learned</span><span>  from  one  of  the  initiated  that  the  letter  referred</span><span>  to  by  ""Kilana""  was  a  communication  addressed  to</span><span>  me  by  the  honorable  the  Minister  for  Lands  and</span><span>  Public  Works,  dated  the  22nd  April  last  :  but  as</span><span>  the  wharf  was  not  washed  away  until  the  latter</span><span>  end  of  May,  as  reported  to  the  honorable  minister</span><span>  by  the  chairman's  letter  of  the  27th  May,  I  do</span><span>  not  clearly  see  how  the  minister's  letter,  dated</span><span>  22nd  April,  could  be  in  reply  to  Mr.  Chairman</span><span>  Uhr's  letter  reporting  the  destruction  of  the</span><span>  wharf  by  the  floods,  dated  the  27th  May.  Neither</span><span>  did  the  letter  of  the  22nd  April  say  one  word</span><span>  about  the  money  being  placed  to  the  credit  of  the</span><span>  Bench  of  Magistrates,  or  that  the  works,  espe-</span><span>  cially  the  wharf,  might  be  at  once  proceeded</span><span>  with.""  So  I  again  say,  ""  Kilana""  speaks  untruly.</span><span>  I  will  merely  state  facts,  without  offering  any  re-</span><span>  marks.  In  the  latter  end  of  April  or  beginning</span><span>  of  May,  I  received  a  communication  from  the</span></p> <p><span>  honorable  tho  Minister  for  Lands  and  Public</span></p> <p><span>  Works,  dated  22nd  April.  That  letter,  as  well</span><span>  as  I  can  recollect,  for  I  am  writing  at  a  distance</span><span>  from  home,  and  quote  from  memory,  was  ""acquaint-</span><span>  ing  me  what  sums  had  been  granted  by  Parlia-</span><span>  ment  for  carrying  out  certain  improvements  in  the</span><span>  district,  and  requesting,  that  as  there  was  no  of-</span><span>  ficer  of  tho  Colonial  Architect's  department  in</span><span>  Maryborough,  I  would  report  as  to  the  best  means</span><span>  for  carrying  out  the  works,-  suggesting  that  I</span><span>  should  co-operate  with  Mr.  Uhr  and  other  gentle-</span><span>  men  for  the  purpose  of  exorcising  a  surveillance</span><span>  over  the  works  -  stating  that  the  Colonial  Archi-</span><span>  tect  would  render  such  assistance  in  preparing</span><span>  plans,  &c""  as  the  distance  from  Maryborough</span><span>  would  admit-and  requesting  me  to  furnish  in</span><span>  formation  respecting  tho  sites  for  the  buildings,</span><span>  &o.""  This  letter  I  looked  upon  then,  as  I  now</span><span>  do,  as  a  communication  from  the  Head  of  my  De-</span><span>  partment  to  a  Government  officer,  from  whom  he</span><span>  required  reiable  information,  and  one  with  which  i</span><span>  the  committee  had  nothing  whatever  to  do.  I</span><span>  did  however,  show  the  letter  to  one  of  the  com-</span><span>  mittee,  a  surveyor,  from  whom  I  obtained  a  small</span><span>  plan  showing  the  sites  for  buildings,  wharf,  &o.  ;</span><span>  and  at  a  meeting  of  the  committee  which  I  at-</span></p> <p><span>  tended  early  in  May,  I  apprised  the  committee</span><span>  that  I  had  received  such  a  letter,  and  that  at  the</span><span>  suggestion  of  the  honorable  the  minister,  I  was</span><span>  willing  to  co-operate  with  them,  and  to  do  any-</span><span>  thing  in  my  power  to  assist  in  carrying  out  the</span><span>  objects  of  the  committee,  which  I  think  is  noted</span></p> <p><span>  on  the  Minutes  of  that  meeting.

"<p><span>  To  the  Editor  of  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SIR,—It  has  long  been  recognised  as  an  axiom  in</span><span>  moral  philosophy,  that  vicious  habits  are  the  re-</span></p> <p><span>  sult  of  a  vicious  nature,  and  this  is  as  demon-</span><span>  strably  correct,  even  to  the  most  casual  observer,</span><span>  as  that  the  sun  will  rise  to-morrow,  or  that  the</span><span>  whole  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  all  its  parts.  And</span><span>  so  firmly  is  this  philosophical  truth  engrafted</span><span>  upon  the  human  mind,  that  man  is  naturally</span><span>  prone  to  believe  his  kindred  almost  as  innocent</span><span>  and  guileless  as  when  placed  by  his  Creator  in  the</span><span>  Elysian  Groves  of  the  Garden  of  Eden,  until  facts,</span><span>  and  circumstances,  combine  to  prove  otherwise</span><span>  It  is  as  impossible  for  a  person,  inherently  of  a</span><span>  meek  and  quiet  temperament,  and  disposed  to</span><span>  live  peaceably  with  those  with  whom  he  is  daily</span></p> <p><span>  called  in  contact,  to  wantonly  lavish  abuse,  injuri-</span><span>  ons  to  the  character  and  reputation  of  his  neigh-</span><span>  bour,  without  any  tangible  assignable  reason,  as</span><span>  it  is  for  a  Feejee  savage  to  demonstrate  to  you</span><span>  the  difference  between  direct  and  inverse  propor-</span><span>  tion  ;  or  an  Australian  aboriginal  to  dilate  upon</span><span>  the  countless  worlds  which  fill  ethereal  space,  with</span><span>  the  powerful  eloquence  and  majestic  strains  of  the</span><span>  illustrious  Newton.  And  by  a  parity  of  reason-</span><span>  ing,  when  newspaper  readers  think  it  worth  their</span><span>  while  to  peruse  criticisms  upon  controversial  topics</span><span>  of  the  day,  and  the  letters  of  correspondents,  ex-</span><span>  posing  public  abuses  with  a  view  to  their  ultimate</span><span>  amelioration,  they  are  always  anxious  to  hear  both</span><span>  sides  of  the  question,  and  to  lead  the  replies  of</span><span>  correspondent's  entertaining  different  opinions,  be-</span><span>  fore  they  presume  to  give  a  decisive  answer  upon</span><span>  the  subject  brought  before  them  ;  or  as  to  the  ex-</span><span>  pediency  of  such  abuses,  if  any  exist,  being  recti-</span><span>  fied.  Mr.  Editor,  your  readers  and  the  public</span><span>  generally  have  had  the  opportunity  of  perusing</span><span>  the  letters  and  articles  which  have  emanated  from</span><span>  the  humble  pen  of  the  undersigned,  relative  to</span><span>  judicial  and  other  affairs  connected  with  the  town</span><span>  of  Drayton.  A  correspondent,  under  the  nom  de</span></p> <p><span>  plume  of  Watchman,  in  the  North  Australian  of</span><span>  the  16th  instant,  emerges  from  his  dignified  seclu-</span><span>  sion,  declares  himself  the  champion  par  excel-</span><span>  lence  of  the  Drayton  Bench—proudly  boasts  that</span><span>  rights,  truth,  and  justice,  must  finally  conquer,</span><span>  and  charges  the  correspondent  whose  signature  is</span><span>  to  him  an  Egyptian  hieroglyphic,  with  being</span><span>  much  too  personal  in  his  attacks,  and  severe  in</span><span>  his  criticisms.  In  replying  to  these  charges  I</span><span>  shall  abstain  as  much  as  possible  from  indulging</span><span>  in  unnecessary  abuse  or  vituperative  language,</span><span>  because  I  am  fully  aware  that  when  such  weapons</span><span>  are  employed  to  demonstrate  that  one  is  right,</span><span>  and  the  other  necessarily  wrong,  it  is  an  indubit-</span><span>  able  indication  of  weakness,  and  of  a  bad  and</span><span>  hopeless  cause</span></p> <p><span>  I  think  if  Mr.  Watchman,  et  hoc  genus  homne,</span><span>  had  read  the  letters  bearing  the  (to  him)  unintel-</span><span>  ligible  signature,  with  common  schoolboy  atten-</span><span>  tion,  he  would  have  observed  that  I  avoided,  par-</span><span>  ticularly  so,  personalities  ;  and  therefore,  notwith-</span></p> <p><span>  standing  his  vaunted  boast  of  truth  and  conscien-</span><span>  tiousness,  I  unhesitatingly  affirm  that  his  state-</span><span>  ments  are  false,  and  his  assertions  untrue.  In</span><span>  the  first  letter  which  I  wrote  relative  to  the</span><span>  Drayton  Bench  and  Mr  William  Weston,  the</span><span>  following  paragraph  occurs  :—""I  do  not  wish  to</span><span>  utter  a  single  word  disrespectfully  of  our  mag-</span><span>  nates—far  from  it.  I  believe  many  of  them  in</span><span>  their  private  capacity  to  be  good  and  estimable</span><span>  men,  and  valuable  members  of  the  community  ;</span><span>  but  whilst  officiating  as  magistrates  in  the  adjudi-</span><span>  cation  of  cases  brought  before  them,  they  are</span><span>  public  property  and  their  proceedings  and  de-</span><span>  cisions  are  open  to  the  legitimate  criticisms  of  the</span><span>  press.""  Is  there  anything  personal  or  offensive</span><span>  in  this?  Can  Mr.  Watchman  point  to  a  single</span><span>  word  in  this  or  any  other  portion  of  my  letter,</span><span>  which  encroaches  upon  the  private  secrecy  or</span><span>  household  matters  of  any  individual,  be  he  magis-</span><span>  trate  or  civilian?  I  think  not  if  it  be  true</span><span>  that  none  are  so  deaf  as  those  that  will  not  hear,</span><span>  it  is  equally  true,  that  none  are  so  blind  as  those</span><span>  that  will  not  see,  and  I  would  suggest  for  Watch-</span><span>  man's  especial  benefit,  that  he  forthwith  provide</span><span>  himself  with  a  pair  of  Wellerian  spectacles  to</span><span>  facilitate  his  perusal  of  the  Courier.  Had  this</span><span>  highly  veracious,  I  almost  said  insignificant</span><span>  whipster,  confined  himself  truths  when  intro-</span></p> <p><span>  ducing  so  condescendingly  his  olive  branch  of</span><span>  peace,  I  should  have  found  it  much  easier  to  have</span><span>  defended  myself  against  his  subtle  insinuations.</span></p> <p><span>  But  as  he  is  a  conscientious  (?)  individual,  on  all</span><span>  occasions  adheres  to  truth  (?)  and  and  is  always  actuat-</span><span>  ed  by  the  purest  (?)  and  most  patriotic  motives  (?)</span><span>  we  must  take  the  most  rational  and  charitable</span></p> <p><span>  view  of  his  case,  and  suppose  that  at  the  time  of</span><span>  his  inditing  his  grandiloquent  epistle,  he  was  la-</span></p> <p><span>  bouring  under  some  mental  hallucination.  But</span></p> <p><span>  whether  he  is  a  fit  subject  for  a  de  lunatico  in-</span></p> <p><span>  guirendo,  I  shall  leave  to  others  more  competent</span><span>  to  form  an  opinion.  If,  Sir,  the  press  is  to  be  re-</span></p> <p><span>  cognised  as  the  great  palladium  of  the  rights  and</span><span>  liberties  of  subjects  of  the  British  empire,  the</span><span>  channel  through  which  acts  of  injustice  are  ex-</span><span>  posed  to  the  public  eye,  and  justice  (heavens,  what</span></p> <p><span>  thoughts  arise  when  we  mention  this  word)  meted</span><span>  out  impartially  to  the  rich  and  the  poor,  then  I</span><span>  maintain  that  in  publishing  and  severely  censuring</span><span>  Weston's  dismissal  from  custody,  when  a  charge</span><span>  of  robbery  was  preferred  against  him,  I  performed</span><span>  no  more  than  my  duty  as  a  man  and  a  citizen.</span></p> <p><span>  Deprive  us  of  the  liberty  of  the  press  and  what</span><span>  would  become  of  our  boasted  rights  and  immuni-</span><span>  ties?  How  those  ""clothed  in  little  brief  au-</span></p> <p><span>  thority""  would  chuckle  and  gloat  over  their</span><span>  victims,  were  it  not  tor  the  stunning,  deafening,</span></p> <p><span>  thunders  of  the  Fourth  Estate  ?</span></p> <p><span>  Even  tyrants  whom  no  powers  distress,</span></p> <p><span>  tremble  when  they  hear  the  thunders  of  the  Press</span><span>  Roll  through  their  kindgdoms  in  the  civil  storm,</span><span>  Proclaiming  Justice,  Freedom,  and  Reform.</span></p> <p><span>  Yes,  Mr.  Watchman,  I  have  not  the  slightest</span><span>  doubt  but  what  you  have  felt  deeply  the  extreme</span></p> <p><span>  keeness  of  the  pen  of  a  newspaper  correspondent,</span><span>  and  hence  your  aversion,  real  or  pretended,  to</span><span>  anonymous  letters.  But  how  singularly  unfortu-</span><span>  nate  that  while  enforcing  in  a  very  determined</span><span>  spirit,  the  necessity  and  duty  of  newspaper  writers</span><span>  affixing  their  bona  fide  names  to  their  productions,</span><span>  Watchman  himself  should  be  unable  or  afraid  to</span></p> <p><span>  act  upon  the  advice  he  tenders;  and  if  it  be  not</span><span>  considered  an  act  of  sacrilege,  I  would  say  to  him</span><span>  in  the  unerring  words  of  holy  writ—""  Thou  fool,</span><span>  first  remove  the  beam  from  thine  own  eye,  before</span><span>  thou  attempt  to  extract  the  mote  from  that  of</span><span>  thy  brother's""  Verily,  Mr.  Watchman,  if  you</span></p> <p><span>  are  without  sin  cast  the  first  stone.</span></p> <p><span>  No  doubt  it  is  highly  advantageous  in  large,</span><span>  as  well  as  small  communities,  that  we  should  live</span><span>  peaceably  and  harmoniously  together.  But  what</span><span>  has  our  being  on  friendly  terms  with  each  other  to</span></p> <p><span>  do  with  the  administration  of  justice  and  the</span><span>  criticisms  thereon  ?  Does  Watchman  mean  to</span><span>  propound  the  strange  Utopia,  that  we  are  to</span><span>  witness  the  majesty  of  ""  Justice""  degraded  from</span></p> <p><span>  her  sacred  throne,  and  not  raise  our  voice  in  pro-</span><span>  testation,  simply  because  by  doing  so,  we  shall</span><span>  disturb  and  render  peculiarly  uneasy,  the  deities</span></p> <p><span>  which  occupy  the  judgment  seat  of  Nemesis  at</span><span>  Drayton  ?  If  so,  the  sooner,  he  conceals  his  caput</span><span>  nortium  among  the  exuberant  vegetation  of</span><span>  Darling  Downs,  the  better  for  himself,  and  those</span><span>  sacred  persons  whose  unimpeached  and  unimpeach-</span><span>  able  private  characters  he  has  arisen,  ephemera</span></p> <p><span>  like  to  defend.  ""  A  fellow  feeling,""  says  the</span></p> <p><span>  poet,  ""makes  us  wondrous  kind,""  and  hence  the</span><span>  very,  very  touching  and  thrilling  (?)  appeal  of</span><span>  Watchman  on  behalf  of  ""  injured  innocence!  !  !  !""</span><span>  which  I  intend  to  remit,  per  first  steamer,  to  the</span><span>  Museum  in  London,  as  a  literary  curiosity  of  a</span><span>  magisterial  Watchman  in  the  districts  of  Darling</span><span>  Downs.</span></p> <p><span>  I  can  assure  Mr.  Watchman  and  those  whose</span><span>  mouth-piece  he  has  become,  that  there  is  not  the</span></p> <p><span>  slightest  disposition  on  my  part  ""to  put  down,</span><span>  frighten,  or  thwart""  those  who,  in  performing  a</span></p> <p><span>  painful  duty,  only  do  that  which  is  demanded  of</span></p> <p><span>  them  by  their  country.  I  know  perfectly  well</span><span>  that  it  is  as  impossible  for  a  magistrate  to  give</span></p> <p><span>  equitable  decisions  on  all  occasions,  suitable  to  the</span><span>  wishes  of  complainant  and  defendant,  as  it  is  for</span><span>  a  newspaper  writer  to  indite  in  a  strain  that  shall</span><span>  please  all  and  offend  none.  But  the  particular</span><span>  cases  which  I  hare  alluded  to  in  my  respective</span><span>  letters,  and  which  appears  to  have  obliterated  the</span></p> <p><span>  peace  propensities  of  the  Drayton  Watchman,  were</span><span>  such  as  to  demand  a  passing  notice  in  the  columns</span><span>  of  a  newspaper.  And  the  feeble,  futile  attempt</span><span>  at  vindication  on  the  part  of  Watchman,  has</span></p> <p><span>  rather  strengthened  my  opinion  than  otherwise.</span><span>  During  the  five  years  I  have  been  connected  with</span><span>  the  press,  there  are  no  articles  which  I  have</span><span>  written  which  I  can  look  back  upon  with  less</span><span>  regret  than  those  which  have  appeared  in  your</span><span>  columns,  having  reference  to  Weston  and  the</span><span>  Drayton  Bench,  Mr.  Watchman  notwithstanding.</span></p> <p><span>  In  conclusion,  Sir,  allow  me  to  observe,  that  while</span><span>  I  shall  ever  deem  it  an  imperative  duty  to  act</span><span>  I  upon  the  advice  of  one  of  the  greatest  men  who</span></p> <p><span>  ever  lived,  and  who  being  dead  yet  speaketh,—</span><span>  ""  to  watch  closely,  jealously,  and  anxiously,  the</span><span>  administration  of  justice.""

"<p><span>  POLITICAL  AGITATION.</span></p> <p><span>  To  the  Editor  of  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SIB,-lu  your  contemporary  of  Wednesday  last</span><span>  .are  letters  from  somo  gentlemen  who  have  felt</span><span>  aggriovod  at  my  remarks  as  contained  in  your</span><span>  issue  of  the  4th  hist.  First,  Mr.  G.  Raff  denies</span><span>  .having  used  the  words  ""  it  seemed  to  have  tako'n</span><span>  tho  screw  off  him,""  in  referring  to  the  proposer  of</span><span>  the  resolutions  at  the  meeting  in  the  School  of</span><span>  Arts.  The  writer  of  this  has  since  taken  the</span></p> <p><span>  opinion  of  several  who  were  present  as  to  whether</span><span>  these  wore  the  words  used,  and  they  say  they</span><span>  wore.  And  it  is  well  known  that  the  papers  do</span><span>  not  report  all  that  is  said,  as  also  that  they  soften</span><span>  any  ollbnsivo  expressions  that  maybe  used/as  they</span></p> <p><span>  bave  dono  in  this  case.</span></p> <p><span>  -  Nor  can  I  seo  why  Mr.  Raff  should  object  lo</span><span>  Mr.  Holt's  getting  credit  for  establishing  a  third</span><span>  bank  in  Brisbane.  I  have  often  heard  Mr.  Raff</span><span>  getting  credit  for  his  exertions  in  the  estub'.ish</span><span>  ment  of  a  second  bank  in  this  town  when  it  was</span><span>  much  wanted.  And  will  any  but  those  connectod</span><span>  with  the  other  banks  say  that  the  third  bank  was</span><span>  not  required,  and  has  iiot  been  useful,  whilo  in</span><span>  both  cases  the  banks  are  also  heiielittcd.  Why,</span><span>  then,  refuse  Mr.  Holt  credit  for  baiiefitting  both</span><span>  the  bank  and  the  public  Î  Again,  Mr.  Raff  de-</span><span>  nies  having  nsod  the  expression  with  regard  to</span><span>  another  candidate  for  legislative  honors  sometime</span><span>  ago  ;  that  ""Mr.  Hodgson  would  oblige  nie,  and</span><span>  wTiv  should  I  not  obligo  him  ?""  Now  Mr.  Raff</span><span>  will  recollect,  that  after  Mr,  Hodgson's  being  de-</span><span>  feated  for  the  County  of  Stanley  in  1851,  some  of</span><span>  his  friends  dined  with  him  in  Brisbane,  and  the</span><span>  above  expression  was  said  to  bo  part  of  Mr.  Raff's</span><span>  Btioech  ou  that  occasion,  and  caused  some  surprise</span><span>  then.  I  am  glad  Mr.  Ran'  repudiated  the  princi-</span><span>  ple  implied  in  such  expressions.</span></p> <p><span>  .'  The  next  labored  epistle  is  from  Mr.  Samuel</span><span>  Taylor  Kerfoot,  who  seems  to  bo  in  somo  difficulty</span><span>  from  which  he  cannot  well  extricate  himself;  anil</span><span>  lie  deals  out  his  rmnblo-de-tliumps  on  those  who</span><span>  shelter  themselves  under  any  appellation  however</span><span>  modost.  But  a  word  in  your  ear,  Samuel,  ""  the</span><span>  prudent  man  hideth  himself,  while  the  simple  pass</span><span>  .on  and  aro  punished.""  There  is  also  a  heap  of</span><span>  .rubbish  raised  by  some  literary  molo  in  the  same</span><span>  paper,  and  marked  ""  An  Elector  ;""  but  such  crea-</span><span>  tures  aro  not  safo  to  dissect  in  any  clean  place,  1</span><span>  shall  therefore  wait  until  he  comes  noar  tho  river.</span></p> <p><span>  But,  Sir,  what  does  all  this  opposition  to  Mr.</span><span>  Holt  spring  from  Î  Let  us  soo.  The  most  stronu</span><span>  oas  springs  from  a  determination  to  mako  it  np</span><span>  ""pîartnat  Mr.  Holt  lins  really  done.somotbing  very</span><span>  wrong  and  this  entirely  hinges  on  the  fact  that  if</span><span>  'Mr.  Holt  did  not  do  anything  deserving  theconsure</span><span>  heaped  upon  him,  then  we  have  done  something</span><span>  Wrong  in  our  treatment  of  bim  its  our  member.</span></p> <p><span>  And  in  order  to  arrive  at  a  fair  conclusion  we  will</span><span>  take  the  opinion  of  an  ablo  writer  on  thin  subject,</span><span>  namely,  the  duties  of  a  Roproseutatite  :  ""  It  is</span><span>  Ids  duty  to  represent  the  opinions  of  his  consti-</span><span>  tuents,  and  to  not  and  voto  upon  his  own.  It  has</span><span>  been  well  remarked,  that  a  Senator  should  con-</span><span>  sider  himself  not  so  much  the  representativo  of</span><span>  one  portion  of  tho  community,  as  n  loghlatocfor</span><span>  all  ;  and  ho  can  fulfill  this  superior  duty  only  by</span><span>  exercising  his  individual  judgment.""  And  the</span><span>  same  authority  says,  that  ""if  it  he  found  that  a</span><span>  majority  of  his  votos  are  at  variance  with  the  de-</span><span>  sires  of  his  e-onstitmnts,  ho  ought  to  resign.""  So</span><span>  then,  as'Mr.  Holt  has  only  offended  hy  ono  vote,</span><span>  all  his  other  votes  being  unobjectionable,  ho  has</span><span>  no  right  to  resign,  and  wo  had  no  right  to  ask</span><span>  bim  to  do  so.

"<p><span>  DB.  LEICHHARDT.</span></p> <p><span>  To  the  Editor  of  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier,</span></p> <p><span>  SIR,-In  this  day'  Herald  appears  a  paragraph</span><span>  reporting  that  a  personal  investigation  had  been</span><span>  made  by  His  Excellency  the  Governor-General  into</span></p> <p><span>  the  statements  of  the  convict  Garbut,  at  Cockatoo</span><span>  Island,  with  respect  to  the  alleged  captivity  of</span></p> <p><span>  Dr.  Leichhardt  and  his  party,  with  a  tribe  of  semi</span><span>  savages  in  the  interior.  The  report  adds,  that  a</span><span>  farther  inquiry  was  about  to  be  instituted,  in  the</span><span>  pretence  of  Mr.  Hely,  who  commanded  the  last</span><span>  expedition  in  search  of  Leichhardt,  and  also  in  the</span><span>  presence  of  Messrs.  Gideon  Lang,  Ferret,  and  J.</span></p> <p><span>  Macarthur,  all  gentlemen  well  acquainted  with</span><span>  the  country  about  the  Lower  Condamine.  This</span><span>  is,  so  far,  satisfactory.  Few  persons  of  ordinary</span><span>  intellgence  who  have  read  the  strange  stories  of</span><span>  Garbut  can  doubt  that  they  are  purely  tho  pro-</span><span>  duction  of  his  own  imagination,  stimulated  by  a</span><span>  desire  to  escape  from  custody.  But  you  will  ob</span><span>  serve  that  the  paragraph  in  question  proceeds  to</span><span>  anticipate  opinions,  by  declaring  that  no  experi-</span></p> <p><span>  enced  bushman  now  entertains  a  doubt  of  the</span><span>  story  of  Leichhardt's  murder,  as  told  by  the  blacks</span><span>  to  Mr.  Hely  and  others.  If  the  object  of  the  in-</span><span>  quiry  be  merely  to  test  the  truth  of  Garbut's</span><span>  statement,  there  can  be  no  doubt  of  the  result  ;</span><span>  but  it  is  difficult  to  understand  why  the  solution</span><span>  of  this  question  should  necessarily  involve  the</span><span>  question  of  whether  the  story  of  Leichhardts</span><span>  death,  as  related  by  the  blacks,  is  true  or  false  ?</span><span>  Until  the  result  of  this  investigation  is  made</span></p> <p><span>  public,  it  would  be  premature  to  make  any  further</span><span>  observation  ;  and  I  think  that  the  Herald  would</span><span>  have  done  well  to  have  acted  upon  this  principle.</span><span>  If  it  were  possible  that  the  story  of  this  man</span><span>  Garbut  could  obtain  credence  after  intelligent  in-</span><span>  quiry,  Mr.  Hely's  report  must  necessarily  become</span><span>  mere  waste  paper.  But  this  result  is  not  to  be</span><span>  thought  of,  I  apprehend  ;  and,  supposing  that  the</span><span>  examiners  report  Garbut's  tale  as  altogether  in-</span><span>  credible,  than  circumstance  can  add  no  further</span><span>  value  to  the  report  of  Mr.  Hely,  which  will  rest,</span></p> <p><span>  as  before,  on  its  own  merits.</span></p> <p><span>  I  should  not  have  troubled  you  with  this  but</span><span>  for  the  manner  in  which  the  Herald  apparently</span><span>  strives,  in  the  paragraph  alluded  to,  to  establish</span><span>  the  accuracy  of  Mr.  Hely  and  those  who  think  as</span><span>  he  does  in  this  matter.  Your  reader,  will,  no</span><span>  doubt,  agree  with  me  that,  whatever  may  be  the</span></p> <p><span>  result  of  this  inquiry,  it  is  not  intended  as  a  test</span><span>  of  the  value  of  Mr.  Hely's  expedition  ;  and,  as</span><span>  resident  within  the  district  which  Leichhardt</span><span>  made  his  point  of  departure,  they  will  probably</span><span>  form  and  entertain  their  own  opinions  as  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  efficiency  of  all  explorations  hitherto  made  in</span><span>  search  of  the  missing  traveller.

"<p><span>  /  )  ,  ,  ,  .THE  a</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  MARCH  14,  1857.  ft]</span></p> <p><span>  PARLIAMENTARY  REFORM.  ti</span></p> <p><span>  jf  ia  pretty  commonly  acknowledged  that</span><span>  the  Constitution  of  New  South  Wales  re-</span><span>  quires  amending  in  several  important</span><span>  ?points.  It  could  scarcely  to  otherwise.</span><span>  ¡Considering  the  dubious  nature  5f  the</span><span>  nullifications  possessed  by  many  of  the</span><span>  jnemfrers  of  the  old  Assembly  for  the</span><span>  work  of  constitution-making,  their  anti</span><span>  T)ro°Tessiv-e  tendencies,  and  the  imperfect</span><span>  manser  in  which  publio  opinion  was  re-</span><span>  mounted  under  the  then  system,  wo  can-</span><span>  not  bo  surprised  at  the  Constitution  being</span><span>  ""  found  defeotivö  in  many  respects,  and  at</span></p> <p><span>  it*  foilino-  to  meet  with  tho  approbation</span><span>  of  the  people.  The  wôiîi  of  framing  a</span><span>  Constitution  for  a  rapidly-rising  eOiPny</span><span>  like  Now  South  Wales  ought  not  to  havô</span><span>  been  entrusted  to  a  clicme  or  class,  .but</span><span>  «tn»Ut  to  have  been  shared  m  by  the  re</span></p> <p><span>  ;Sntat?ves  if  the  whole  of  the  inhabit-</span></p> <p><span>  ants  of  the  colony.  The  Legislature  of</span><span>  that  day  did  not  represent  public  opinion,</span><span>  and  on  that  ground  it  has  boen  assorted</span><span>  that  it  was  not  entitled  to  ant«  a  consti-</span><span>  tution  for  us.  The  Solicitoi'-General</span><span>  himself  is  of  opinion  that  the  old  As-</span><span>  sembly  was  not  competent  to  deal  with</span><span>  the  matter.  It  is  too  late  now,  however,</span><span>  to  disoues  this  question  ;  the  people  have</span></p> <p><span>  »till  the  power  to  alter  the  Constitution.</span></p> <p><span>  {o  mt  their  present  wishes  m  require.  I</span></p> <p><span>  lo,</span><span>  ed</span></p> <p><span>  nients  ;  and  with  this  privilege  let  thom</span></p> <p><span>  be  content.  '  ^</span></p> <p><span>  The  Electoral  Reform  League,  recently</span><span>  established  in  Sydney,  is  likely  to  do</span><span>  great  good  in  drawing  attention  to  the</span><span>  important  subject  of  Parliamentary  Re-</span><span>  form,  Without  reform  in  the  electoral</span></p> <p><span>  system,  it  ia  very  questionable  what  be-</span><span>  nefit  we  arc  to  derive  from  ""  responsible</span><span>  government.""  It  seems  to  have  been  the</span><span>  aim  of  the  framers  of  the  Electoral  Act,</span><span>  while  malting  it,  to  all  appearance,  very</span><span>  liberal,  and  founding  the  franchise  on</span><span>  nearly  a  universal  basis,  to  encumber  the</span><span>  exercise  of  the  latter  by  many  and  vexa-</span><span>  tious  regulations,  and  to  swamp  the  popu-</span><span>  lar  voice  by  unequal  and  arbitrary  divi-</span><span>  sions  of  the  elcctoial  districts.  Thousands</span><span>  of  nominal  electors-especially  single  men</span><span>  -have  found  themselves  virtually  dis-</span><span>  franchised  by  the  clause  enjoining  six</span><span>  months'  residenccin  one  house.  In  theory,</span><span>  the  Act  goes  very  nearly  the  length  of</span><span>  universal  suffrage  ;  would  it  not  be  well</span><span>  at  once  to  recoguise  every  man  of  full</span><span>  age  as  entitled  to  a  vote,  and  thus  remove</span><span>  the  petty  annoyances  and  sources  of  dis</span><span>  patisfaction  which  at  present  exist  ?  We</span><span>  nie  satisfied  that  it  must  come  to  this</span><span>  ultimately;  and  we  are  glad  that  the</span><span>  League  has  taken  the  matter  up,  and</span><span>  insists  upon  manhood  suffrage  ;  the  only</span><span>  qualification  being  six  months'  residence</span><span>  in  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  Rut  the  most  extended  suffrage  would</span><span>  be  totally  inadequate  without  a  re-divi-</span><span>  sion  of  the  clecloial  districts.  Wc  entirely</span><span>  agree  with  the  League  that  equal  electo-</span><span>  ral  districts,  based  on  population,  is  the</span><span>  just  principle  of  representation.  We</span><span>  would  like  to  know  how  the  Colonial  Se-</span><span>  cretary's  systom  maintained  on  a  bond</span><span>  of  interests,  could  be  carried  out;  where'</span><span>  ""  all  interests  should  be  so  nicely  balanced</span><span>  that  each  should  have  a  fair  and  equal</span><span>  share  of  representation.""  It  would  be</span><span>  rather  a  puzzle  to  fix  op  the  importance</span><span>  or  value  (ever-changing),  of  the  various</span><span>  interests  in  the  colony  ;-the  squatting,</span><span>  the  mercantile,  the  agricultural,  the  dig-*</span><span>  ging,  the  mechanical,  &c.  If  one  poor</span><span>  shepherd  is,  as  Mr.  BUCKLEY  says,  worth</span><span>  as  much  to  the  colony  as  fifty  mechanics,</span><span>  what  must  be  the  value  of  a  shepherd</span><span>  king  himself?  Mr.  BUCKLEY,-a  store-</span><span>  keeper,  a  mei  chant,  merely-would  have</span><span>  to  hide  his  diminibhed  head  before  the</span><span>  ""noble  of  the  land""  Such  ideas  are</span><span>  not  woith  controverting;  but  they  show</span><span>  to  what  absurdities  people  are  reduced</span><span>  when  they  neglect  the  plain  teachings  of</span><span>  common  sense.  This  theoiy  of  inteiest</span><span>  ""g  I  is  about  the  most  absuid  idea  we  ever</span></p> <p><span>  'j'1  heard  propounded,  even  in  a  colonial  Lc</span></p> <p><span>  ""¡1  gisldtivc  Assembly.</span></p> <p><span>  It  has  been  shown  that  a  thousand  men</span><span>  taken  indiscriminately  from  any  part  of</span><span>  the  country  would  be  equal  to  any  thou-</span><span>  sand  men  in  any  other  pait  in  regal  c1  to</span><span>  piopcity.  This  might  seun  a  fair  objec-</span><span>  tion  to  those  who  maintain  that,  by  tak-</span><span>  ing  population  as  the'basis  of  représenta-</span><span>  tion,  the  rights  of  property  would  be  sub-</span><span>  verted.  But  this  is  not  the  real  objec-</span><span>  tion  to  tho  population  system.  Our  Go-</span><span>  vernment  is  squatter  at  heart  ;  and  it  is</span><span>  desirous  that  the  squatting  element  should</span><span>  pievail  in  the,Lci;islature,  as  it  has  pre-</span><span>  viously  done.  What  could  bo  bettor</span><span>  adapted  to  secure  this  than  the  plan  of</span><span>  arbitary  electoral  distiicts?  Than  the</span><span>  system  of  enabling  some  half-dozen  set-</span><span>  tlers,  with  their  dependants,  to  return  as</span><span>  many  representatives  as  would  fall  to  the</span><span>  share  of  a  thickly-peopled  locality  ?  If</span><span>  we  want  the  land-monopoly  removed,  and</span><span>  our  resources  fully  developed  ;  if  we  wish</span><span>  to  see  the  government  of  the  country  con-</span><span>  ducted  for  the  benefit  of  the  whole  peo-</span><span>  ple,  as  it  ought  to  be,  instead  of  for  the  ad-</span><span>  vantage  of  cliques  and  intciests,as  it  has</span><span>  always  been,  our  representative  system</span><span>  must  be  modelled  on  the  basis  of  popula-</span><span>  tion.  By  doing  so,  we  not  only  adopt</span><span>  tlie  easiest  method,  but  at  the  samo  time</span><span>  property  will  bo  best  represented.</span></p> <p><span>  Wo  suppose  the  originators  of  the  re-</span><span>  form  movement  did  not  wish  to  encumber</span><span>  their  programme  with  too  many  measures.</span><span>  This  will  probably  account  for  the  omis-</span><span>  sion  of  the  ballot,  which  we  consider  an</span><span>  important  auxiliary  in  the  electoral  sys-</span><span>  tem.  In  Australia,  we  aie  happy  to</span><span>  think,  there  does  not  exist  the  same</span><span>  urgent  necessity  for  this  protective  moa</span><span>  sure  as  in  the  old  country  j  but  cases  of</span><span>  undue  influence  being  exercised  must  be</span><span>  of  frequent  occuircnce  hero  too,  and  it</span><span>  would  be  well  to  give  every  protection  to</span><span>  the  voter  in  the  conscientious  exercise  of</span><span>  his  right.  The  ballot  has  other  recom-</span><span>  mendations  besides  its  protective  pro;</span><span>  pcrty.  In  Victoria^  it,  has  been  shown</span><span>  that  the  elections  which  took  placo  under</span><span>  the  ballot  were  much  more  quietly  con</span><span>  'du'eted  than'  they,  had  been  previously</span><span>  under  the  old  system.  ?*  The  Leaguo.may,</span><span>  net  wisely  in  cpnfining  their  attention  at</span><span>  present  more  immediately,to  the  suffrage</span><span>  and  to  the  electoral  divisions  ;  but  wo</span><span>  hope  to  see  the  ballot  introduced  before</span><span>  long.</span></p> <p><span>  Tho  late  decision  of  the  Assembly,  that</span><span>  all  deliberative  bodies  entrusted  with  le-</span><span>  gislative  functions  ought  to  be  elected  by</span><span>  the  people,  is  a  strong  indication  of  the</span><span>  speedy  downfall  of  the  nominee  system,</span><span>  and  shows  that  the  desire  for  reform</span><span>  among  the  members  of  the  ""Lower</span><span>  House""  is  more  general  than  might  have</span><span>  been  imagined  from  some  of  their  pro-</span><span>  ceedings.  Wo  do  not  believe  in  the  co-</span><span>  existence  of  a  representative  and  a  nomi</span><span>  noo  Legislature.  The  two  must,  from  tho</span><span>  nature  of  things,  often  como  into  collision.</span><span>  The  pretensions  of  our  Upper  House  have</span><span>  already  been  evinced  in  the  desire  to  inter-</span><span>  fere  in  money  matters,-a  privilege  which</span><span>  the  English  House  of  Lords  has  long  since</span><span>  relinquished  With  the  Assembly  within,</span><span>  and  the  people  without,  both  opposed  to</span><span>  the  continuance  of  a  nominee  legislature,</span><span>  jt  may  safely  be  affirmed  that  the  Upper</span><span>  House,  as  at  present  constituted,  will  havo</span><span>  but  a  very  briof  existence.  It  will  bo  a</span></p> <p><span>  matter  for  futuro  consideration  whether</span></p> <p><span>  a  second  chamber  is  really  required  for  {</span><span>  the  purposes  of  legislation.  I</span></p> <p><span>  These  are  some  of  the  roforms  whioh</span></p> <p><span>  we  believe  rnuS.t  take  placn  in  our  parlia-  ?  ^</span><span>  montary  system  boiCTG  we  can  «suppôt  to  j</span><span>  Soo  tho  government  of  the  country  cairied</span><span>  on  (is  it  ought  to  bo.  The  Moreton  Buy</span><span>  peoplo  have  perhaps  less  interest  in  the</span><span>  matter  than  tho  inhabitants  of  other  parts</span><span>  of  the  colony;  for  there  is  every  reason</span></p> <p><span>  to  tliiiik  that  Sepwfttion  will  bo  cwuplot:  L  v</span></p> <p><span>  ed  before  these  measures  of  reform  can</span><span>  bccarried  out,  and  we  will  thus  cease  to</span><span>  have  any  direct  interest'  in  the  govern-</span><span>  ment  of  Now'South  Wales.

The  system</span><span>  of  registering  in  this  colony  is  Alphabe-</span><span>  tical,  but  from  the  frequent  recurrence</span><span>  of  the  same  names  it  is  found  to  be  ex-</span><span>  ceedingly  defective  when  a  search  for</span><span>  any  of  the  registered  conveyances  becomes</span><span>  necessary.  The  Registrar  at  Auokland</span><span>  it  appears  has  devised  ""  a  Numerical  sys-</span><span>  tem  of  Registration  not  encumbered  with</span><span>  any  of  the  difficulties  to  which  reference</span><span>  has  just  been  made,  nor  yet  with  those</span><span>  under  which  thealphabetical  mode  is  weigh-</span><span>  ed  down,  namely,  the  accumulation  of  par-</span><span>  ties  holding  the  same  name,  and  having  by</span><span>  the  same  tedious  process  to  ferret  out  all</span><span>  tlio  various  instruments  which  have  re-</span><span>  ference  to  the  same  property.  The  Nu-</span><span>  merical  system,  though  it  provides  a</span><span>  separate  designation  to  every  property</span><span>  and  every  subdivision  of  the-  same  as</span><span>  clearly  defined  as  No.  1  Î3  from  No.  2,</span><span>  at  the  same  time  provides  »hat  all  be</span><span>  entered  conscoutively  in  the  same  book,</span><span>  so  that  any  one  of  them  can  be  as  easily</span><span>  arrived  at  as  the  other.  It,  virtually</span><span>  spoaking,  provides  but  one  designation</span><span>  for  all  ;  and  again,  by  its  mode  of  opera-</span><span>  tion,  it  follows  that  if  you  are  in  posses-</span><span>  sion  of  the  number  which  has  been  en-</span><span>  dorsed  by  the  Registrar  upon  any  one  of</span><span>  rhera,  you  have  the  key  which  opens  the</span><span>  title  page  assigned  to  that  particular  pro-</span><span>  perty,  where  at  a  glance  you  see  the</span><span>  wholo  chain  of  deeds  which  have  been</span><span>  registered  affecting  the  same.  By  this</span><span>  din  pie  contrivance-although  the  pro-</span><span>  perty  referred  to  may  have  been  cut  up</span><span>  into  250  original  pieces,  and  each  of  these</span><span>  again  into  as  many  more-still  a  refer-</span><span>  ence  can  be  made  to  any  one  of  them  with</span><span>  the  same  facility  as  to  the  original,  and</span><span>  by  any  party,  however  inexperienced,  ns</span><span>  well  as  by  the  Registrar  himself,  simply</span><span>  by  plaoiug  in  his  hand  the  Book  of  Num-</span><span>  bers,  and  such  a  search  c»n  bo  made  within</span><span>  the  spate  of  two  minutes.""  The  Regis-</span><span>  trar  does  not  enter  into  the  details  of  his</span></p> <p><span>  plan,  but  we  can  easily  believe  it  to  be</span><span>  perfectly  practicable  by  means  of  a  change</span></p> <p><span>  of  numbers-whioh  admit  of  almost  in-</span><span>  finite  permutations-to  identify  every</span><span>  parcel  of  land  with  all  its  subdivisions,</span><span>  however  numerous  these  may  be.  Such</span><span>  a  system  would  result  in  making  the  Re-</span><span>  gistrar  at  the  same  time  the-Conveyancor,</span><span>  and  would  in  effect  supersede  the  inter-</span><span>  vention  of  a  Solicitor.  Tho  registration</span><span>  ivould  likewise  be  the  conveyance.  If</span><span>  iny  deed  passed  between  the  parties,  it</span><span>  would  merely  declare  that  ""AB  trans-</span><span>  fers  his  property  to  CD,""  and  this  would</span><span>  be  followed  by  the  registration  number.</span><span>  ¿The  parties  might  add  the  usual  sur-</span><span>  veyor's  description.  This  would  reduce</span><span>  transactions  in  land  to  the  level  of  any</span><span>  other  -kind  of  commercial  dealing.  AB</span><span>  and  CD  might  walk  into  the  Registrar's</span><span>  office  and  transfer  landed  estate»  as  easily</span><span>  fa^they  could  buy  potatoes  or  corn.</span><span>  Such  seems  to  be  the  practical  end  of  the</span><span>  Numerical  system.  We  desire  greatly  to</span><span>  see  some  simplification  of  our  present</span><span>  conveyances.  ""  I  have  in  my  office,""</span><span>  says  the  Registrar,  ""  a  deed  254  folios</span><span>  long,  alienating  a  small  piece  of  land.  I</span><span>  fancy  I  could  have  reduced  the  whole,</span><span>  with  advantage,  to  a  single  folio  !""  Con-</span><span>  veyancers,  in  the  introductory  portion  of</span><span>  their  deeds,  make  a  practice  of  reciting</span><span>  or  shortly  stating  the  contents  of  some  of</span><span>  the  previous  title  deeds.  Where  the  deeds</span><span>  ure  not  registered  this  is  absolutely  ne-</span><span>  cessary,  and  even  where  they  are,  the</span><span>  usage  cannot  bo  departed  from  in  all</span><span>  cases.  The  registration  by  making  every</span><span>  part  of  tho  title  a  public  record,  almost</span><span>  avoids  the  necessity  of  recitals,  and  con-</span><span>  sequently  shortens  the  conveyance  and</span><span>  diminishes  its  cost.  Under  the  Numeri-</span><span>  cal  system,  however,  the  conveyance  would</span><span>  be  little  more  than  a  ""  bought  and  sold</span></p> <p><span>  note.""</span></p> <p><span>  Thus  far  we  have  traced  the  proposed</span><span>  plan  of  the  Registrar  and  its  assumed</span><span>  consequences.  Wo  feel  the  great  hard-</span><span>  ship  of  imposing  on  a  man  who  buys  £10</span><span>  worth  of  land  the  necessity  of  a  transfer</span><span>  which  costs  him  £5  or  £6  more.  We</span></p> <p><span>  believe  the  Registrar's  system  sufficient</span><span>  where  the  transaction  is  a  mere  sale.</span><span>  But  men  dispose  of  their  property  in</span><span>  many  other  ways  besides  by  sale.  They</span><span>  .make  wills  and  marriage  settlements,  and</span><span>  ojther  instruments  changing  and  affecting</span><span>  property  in  a  variety  of  ways,  to  gratify</span><span>  their  vanity  or  caprice.  The  law  has</span><span>  made  a  tvill  for  every  man.  It  gives  the</span><span>  real  property  to  the  heir-at-law,  and  the</span><span>  personalty  in  certain  proportions  to  the</span><span>  next  of  kin,  It  leaves,  however,  to  every</span><span>  man  the  option  of  disposing  as  he  thinks</span><span>  best  of  his  possessions,  with  certain  re-</span><span>  strictions  required  by  public  policy.  Ac-</span><span>  cordingly,  as  he  ha3  some  one  to  disin-</span><span>  herit  or  another  specially  to  advance,  he</span><span>  makes  a  disposition  of  his  estate  oontrary</span><span>  to  the  usual  statutory  distribution.  In</span><span>  many  instances  tho  objects  of  his  gifts</span><span>  cannot  possess  them  until  some  deferred</span><span>  period,  on  attaining  ago,  ¡fee.  Now  to</span><span>  apply  the  concise  plan  of  conveyancing</span><span>  to  these  cases  would  be  somewhat  difficult.</span><span>  We  do  not  say  it  would  be  impossible.</span><span>  We  merely  throw  out  these  hints  for  the</span><span>  use  of  any  person  who  may  have  given</span><span>  his  attention  to  this  subject,  and  to  show</span><span>  that  men  have  themselves  in  some  mea-</span><span>  sure  to  blame  for  the  existing  complica-</span><span>  tions  in  the  law  of  real  property.  The</span><span>  Registrar  docs  not  appear  to  have  glanced</span><span>  at  wills  and  settlements  in  his  communi-</span></p> <p><span>  cation  to  the  New  ¿ealander.  We  gather</span><span>  from  his  letter  that  he  ia  a  ""Captain</span><span>  KEW/V,""  and  probably  his  knowledge  of</span><span>  the  more  recondite  portions  of  the  law  is</span><span>  not  very  extensive.  It  seems  to  us,  how,</span><span>  ever,  that  whore  a  conditional  disposition</span><span>  and  not  an  absoluto  sale  of  the  property</span><span>  is  made,  there  must  bo  something  to  sup</span><span>  ^ment  his  present  plan,  that  the  Regis</span></p> <p><span>  .  -«14  gag  ¿t  ¿iäouit  to  COiabiüe</span></p> <p><span>  with  his  ooloo  the  functions  of  the  Con</span><span>  veyancer,  and  that  the  state  of  the  title</span><span>  could  scarcely  be  ascertained  in  ""  two</span><span>  minutes.""  There  are  also  many  changes</span><span>  of  ownership  not  affected  by  deed  or  will,</span><span>  such  as  the  death  of  parties,  some  of  them</span><span>  under  agc,  a?d  others  leaving  issue,  &o.</span><span>  Now  for  all  these  accidents  some  provision</span><span>  must  be  made  in  order  that  the  state  of</span><span>  the  title  rri'iy  clearly  appear  upon  the  re-</span><span>  gistry.  When  we  view  all  these  difficul</span><span>  tjes_although  we  do  not  consider  them</span><span>  insurmountable-we  seriously  recommend</span><span>  that  any  such  sweeping  change  in  the  ex-</span><span>  isting  practice  should  be  made  cautiously</span><span>  ,  and  by  some  persons  fully  informed  .  on</span><span>  ?  the  existing  law,  and  skilled  in  its  prac-</span></p> <p><span>  tical  application.</span></p> ",Article,1857-10-17,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

The  advantage  of</span><span>  the  third  object  contemplated  by  a  sys-</span><span>  tem  of  labour,  v¡£.,  self  maintenance,</span><span>  is  strongly  marked  in  a  country  like  this,</span><span>  ?where  labour  generally  is  so  scarce,  and</span><span>  so  costly,  and  where  in  many  places  the</span><span>  most  necessary  public  works  are  wanting.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  too  bad  to  see  the  labour  of  hun</span></p> <p><span>  i  dreds  of  able-bodied  prisoners  absolutely</span></p> <p><span>  wasted,  while  the  roads  in  some  places,</span><span>  or  rather  the  want  of  roads,  is  such  that</span><span>  the  traine  is  liable  to  be  interrupted  by</span><span>  every  rainy  day  thatooGurs;  and  this  too</span><span>  when  the  country  is  faying  at  the  rate</span><span>  of  &lt;?25  per  annum  for  supporting  these</span></p> <p><span>  men  in  idleness.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  scarcely-  possible  to  conceive  any</span><span>  place  in  a  more  primitive  state  with  re-</span><span>  gard  to  such  necessary  public  wi.rks,  as</span><span>  streets,  roads,  bridges,  &c,  than  Brisbanfc</span><span>  and  its  vicinity.  It  is  strange  to  kee  a</span><span>  town,  the  capital  of  a  largo  and  flourish-</span><span>  ing  distiict,  so  long  in  existence  without</span><span>  even  an  attempt  to  form  the  streets,  much</span><span>  less  to  metal  them.  We  question  if</span><span>  ever  any  levels  have  been  taken  of  the</span><span>  streets,  so  that  a  person  building  now  in</span><span>  any  stieet  cannot  bo  sure  that  when  the</span><span>  street  comes  to  be  formed  to  its  level,  his</span></p> <p><span>  house  may  not  be  several  feet  either  above</span><span>  or  below  the  centre  of  the  street,  to  the</span><span>  great  injury  of  bis  property.</span></p> <p><span>  The  uumber  of  prisoners  usually  con-</span><span>  fined  here  may  not  be  great,  but  such  as</span><span>  it  is,  if  thoy  had  been  employed  constantly</span><span>  in  such  works  as  the  formation  and  repair</span><span>  of  the  streets  and  providing  metal,  the</span></p> <p><span>  streets  of  Brisbane  and  the  roads  in  its</span><span>  neighbourhood  would  present  another</span><span>  appearance  than  they  do  now.  A  town</span><span>  or  district  surveyor  to  direct  where  and</span><span>  how  such  works  should  bo  performed,  is</span><span>  a  want  that  should  have  been  supplied</span><span>  long  sinos.</span></p> <p><span>  O-t.

This  prison  containing  on</span><span>  an  average  500  confines  iu  addition  to  de-</span><span>  fraying  tho  expenditure  necessary  to  sus-</span><span>  tain  it,  contributes  a  net  revenue  of</span><span>  20,000  dollars  annually  to  tie  State.</span></p> <p><span>  The  whole  question  of  Prison  Disci-</span><span>  pline,  in  its  widest  sense,  is  peculiarly</span><span>  important  at  the  present  time  when  the</span><span>  ablest  men  of  the  mother  country  seem</span><span>  at  a  loss  to  kuow  how  best  to  dispose  of</span></p> <p><span>  their  criminals.  And  we  think  that  in</span></p> <p><span>  an  improved  system  of  Prison  Discipline</span><span>  will  be  found  the  only  satisfactory  solu-</span><span>  tion  of  the  question  as  to  the  continuing</span><span>  transportation.  Physically  it  must  end</span><span>  some  time,  from  the  want  of  suitable</span><span>  places  for  transporting  convicts,  but  long</span><span>  before  this,  we  apprehend,  it  must  cease</span><span>  from  other  and  moral  causes,  for  no  free</span><span>  people  will  tolerate  near  them  anything</span><span>  so  dangerous  to  the  morality  and  well</span><span>  being  of  the  community  as  a  regular  re-</span><span>  ceptacle  for  all  the  concentrated  villany</span><span>  of  another  country.

The  only</span><span>  legislation  we  require  from  New  South</span><span>  Wales  now  is  the  enactment  of  the  More-</span></p> <p><span>  ton  Bay  Debt  Bill  ;  with  the  passing  of</span><span>  that  measure,  so  far  as  any  legislative</span><span>  act  is  concerned,  our  members  might  ab-</span><span>  sent  th?msclve8  entirely  from  the  House.</span><span>  They,  probably,  had  in  view  the  reten-</span><span>  tion  of  the  present  Ministry  in  power,  so</span><span>  that  no  time  might  be  lost  in  pitting  tho</span><span>  Debt  Bill.

No  doubt,</span><span>  our  legislation  can  be  neutralized,-and  the</span><span>  Pailiament  of  Moreton  Bay  can  repudiate.

DEOEMBER  12,  1857.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  MORETON  RAY  PUBLIC  DEBT  BILL.</span></p> <p><span>  o-t</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Ministry  have  at  last  introduced  the</span><span>  Bill  which  is  to  regulate  the  division  of</span><span>  the  public  debt  between  the  colonies  of</span><span>  New  South  Wales  and  Moreton  Bay.</span><span>  We  published  the  intended  Act,  as  intro-</span><span>  duced  to  the  house  by  Mr.  COWPER,  in</span><span>  our  Supplement  on  Monday  last.  The</span><span>  character  and  number  of  the  accounts  to</span><span>  bo  taken  are  specifically  sot  forth,  but</span><span>  the  details  are  left  to  future  investigation</span><span>  and  arrangement  by  commissioners  to  be</span><span>  nominated  by  the  two  colonies.  The</span><span>  first  and  second  clauses  dispose  of  the</span><span>  public  debt  for  sewerage,  water  supply,</span><span>  and  other  public  works,  by  confining  the</span><span>  liability  of  each  colony  to  the  amount</span><span>  actually  expended  within  its  terrriiorial</span><span>  limits  for  these  undertakings.  We  are</span><span>  thus  relieved  from  the  burden  of  railway</span><span>  expenditure,  except,  ofcourse,  for  the</span><span>  surveys  which  have  been  made  with  a</span><span>  view  to  the  construction  of  any  railway,</span><span>  within  our  own  territory.</span></p> <p><span>  The  third  clause  relates  to  the  nature  of</span><span>  the  account  for  Immigration  expenses.</span><span>  Two  preliminary  accounts  are  to  be  en-</span><span>  tered  into  under  this  head  :-The  first  is</span><span>  to  shew  the  whole  number  of  immigrants</span><span>  for  whose  arrival  in  the  colony  our  money</span><span>  has  been  expended,  and  of  the  respective</span><span>  numbers  who  have  remained  in  or  pro-</span><span>  ceeded  to  any  part  of  the  territory  within</span><span>  either  colony.  The  latter  portion  of  the</span><span>  account  will,  we  imagine,  find  the  com-</span><span>  missioners  no  trifling  amount  of  labor.</span><span>  The  second  account  is  to  shew  all  moneys</span><span>  arising  from  territorial  land  sales,  and  in</span><span>  the  third,  which  is  to  be  prepared  from</span><span>  the  two  former,  each  colony  is  to  be</span><span>  debited  with  a  proportion  of  the  immi-</span><span>  gration  debt,  equivalent  to  the  number</span><span>  of  immigrants  ithas  received  and  is  to</span><span>  be  credited  with  an  amount  equal  to  one</span><span>  half  the  proceeds  of  its  land  sales.  It</span><span>  does  not  appear  for  what  puipose  the  re</span><span>  ""raaining  half  is  to  be  retained  by  New</span><span>  South  Wales,  whether  for  the  ex-</span><span>  penses  of  surveys,  commissions,  &c.,</span><span>  of'whether  our  credit  is  tot  be  for</span><span>  x>ne-half  of  tho  gross  or  net  proceeds.</span><span>  The  bill  is  rather  loosely  worded  in  this</span></p> <p><span>  section.</span></p> <p><span>  The  fourth  section  fixes  the  liability  of</span><span>  each  colony  in  proportion  to  trie  number</span><span>  of  its  inhabitants  at  the  time  of  Separa-</span><span>  tion,  for  the  outstanding  deficiency,  under</span><span>  the  Act  20  Vic.,  No.  1.</span></p> <p><span>  The  fifth  section  regulates  the  division</span><span>  of  the  current  revenue  and  expenditure</span><span>  of  the  colony,  and  the  proportion  to  be</span><span>  borne  by  the  colony  of  Moreton  Bay.</span><span>  Five  accounts  must  bo  taken  under  this</span><span>  section,  commencing  from  the  1st  January,</span><span>  1842.  First-An  account  of  all  moneys</span><span>  which,  within  the  sixteen  years  from  that</span><span>  time,  have  been  specifically  contributed</span><span>  to  the  revenue  by  the  peoplo  of  Moreton</span><span>  Bay.  Secondly-An  account  of  all</span><span>  moneys,  not  before  mentioned,  specifi-</span><span>  cally  expended  upon  the  people  of  More-</span><span>  ton  Bay.  Thirdly-An  account  of  the</span><span>  average  population  in  each  colony  during</span><span>  the  several  years  of  the  same  period.</span><span>  Fourthly-An  account  in  which  Moreton</span><span>  Bay  is  to  bo  debited  with  such  an  amount</span><span>  of  the  general  expenditure  of  New  South</span><span>  Wales  in  each  year  of  the  period,  and  a</span><span>  proportion  of  the  year  of  Separation,  as</span><span>  shall  have  been  in  proportion  to  the  popu-</span><span>  lation  of  the  new  colony  in  each  year</span><span>  and  to  be  credited  with  the  like  annual</span><span>  proportion  of  the  customs'  receipts.</span><span>  Fifthly-An  account  current  in  which</span><span>  áfareton  Bay  shall  be  credited  with  its</span><span>  specific  contributions  under  the  first  ac-</span><span>  count,  debited  with  its  specific  expendi-</span><span>  ture  under  the  second,  and  debited  or</span><span>  credited,  as  may  be  necessary,  with  the</span><span>  balance  on  the  fourth  or  general  revenue</span><span>  rand  customs'  account.  Tho  balance,  if</span><span>  against  us  on  this  account,  is  to  be  borne</span><span>  and  discharged  in  like  manner  as  the</span><span>  amount  which  may  be  duo  under  other</span><span>  sections  of  the  Aot.  If  in  our  favor,</span><span>  wo  are  to  have  credit  for  the  amourft.</span></p> <p><span>  It  will  be  observed,  that  in  taking  this</span><span>  general  revenue  account  the  Executive</span><span>  Council  have  adhered  to  their  own  views,</span><span>  and  departed  from  tho  despatch  of  the</span><span>  Governor-General.  ""  They  advise,""  says</span><span>  his  Excellency,  ""  that  a  sort  of  debtor</span><span>  and  creditor  adcouut  should  be  drawn  up,</span><span>  in  which  the  new  colony  should  receive</span><span>  credit  for  all  the  revenue,  from  whatever</span><span>  source  arising,  which  it  may  hnve  contri-</span><span>  buted  ;  while  it  should  be  debited  with</span><span>  all  the  payments  made  for  local  objects  ;</span><span>  and  also  with  a  fair  proportion  of  the</span><span>  cost  of  the  general  government,-that  is,</span><span>  of  the  cost  of  all  those  departments  which</span><span>  have  no  special  local  attributions,  but</span><span>  deal  with  the  colony  ns  a  whole.  In  this</span><span>  suggestion  of  the  Council,  however,  I</span><span>  cannot  concur.  I  do  not,  in  the  first</span><span>  placo,  consider  that  it  is  founded  upon</span><span>  correct  principles;  and  I  am  afraid,  in</span><span>  the  second,  that  it  would  lead  to  inter-</span><span>  minable  diificulties  between  the  two  co-</span><span>  lonies.""

"<p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  SEPTEMBER  5,  1857</span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  THE  COLONIAL  DEBT  AND  MORETON  BAY.</span></p> <p><span>  OUR  readers  will  observe  in  our  Parlia-</span></p> <p><span>  mentary  Summary,  the  financial  state-</span><span>  ment  which  has  just  been  made  by  the</span><span>  Colonial  Treasurer.  Upon  his  ??????</span><span>  ing  Mr  Donaldson  is  a  kind  of  financial</span><span>  wizard  before  whose  magic  touch  ??  de-</span><span>  ficits""  disappear  in  the  most  easy  way</span><span>  imaginable.  ""  Who  saved  the  money?""</span><span>  ""I,""  says  Mr  D,  ""I  saved  the  money;""</span><span>  and  so  on  in  a  strain  of  bombastic  egotism</span><span>  the  wizard  Treasurer  sounds  forth  his</span><span>  own  wonderful  financial  ""tricks.""  We</span><span>  suspect,  however,  the  assumed  saving  is</span><span>  more  specious  than  real,  and  that  the</span><span>  witchcraft  consists  in  making  it  appear</span><span>  a  saving  rather  than  in  its  really  being</span><span>  such.  Our  immediate  object  is  not  to</span><span>  enter  into  the  financial  statement  general-</span><span>  ly,  but  to  refer  to  the  concluding  portion</span><span>  of  it,  which  affects  Moreton  Bay  in  par-</span><span>  ticular.  We  apprehend  that  the  country</span><span>  will  doubt  the  genuine  nature  of  at  least</span><span>  a  part  of  his  saving.  He  stated  to  the</span><span>  House  that  £10,000  appropriated  would</span><span>  not  be  required,  of  which  £4500  came  under</span><span>  the  head  of  the  pensions  to  the  Judges</span><span>  This  is  tantamount  to  saying  that  time</span><span>  has  dealt  lightly  with  the  Judges,  not</span><span>  afflicting  them  with  any  disability  to  dis-</span><span>  charge  their  high  functions,  and,  that</span><span>  consequently  they  have  not  requited  their</span><span>  pensions;  but  how  the  Government  can</span><span>  claim  credit  for  this  as  a  real  saving  we</span><span>  are  at  a  loss  to  conceive.  How  much</span><span>  more  of  the  assumed  saving  consists  of</span><span>  similar  items,  the  Colonial  Treasurer  did</span><span>  not  inform  the  House.  We  may  safely</span><span>  say,  however,  that  as  regards  the  £10,000</span><span>  the  Treasurer  showed  the  fairest  side  of</span><span>  the  picture.</span></p> <p><span>  At  the  close  of  his  reply  to  Mr.  PID-</span><span>  DINGTON  and  Mi.  RUSDEN  he  said  the</span><span>  amount  realised  by  the  land  sales  was</span><span>  £15,0U0  per  month-and  expressed  his</span></p> <p><span>  desiro  ""  to  sec  the  debentures  placed  on  j</span><span>  such  a  footing  that  they  might  be  cn-  j</span><span>  abled  to  compete  foi  the  uce  ot  British</span></p> <p><span>  capital  on  the  ¿ame  te  ins  as  other  coun-  |</span><span>  tues  ""  It  sec  nu,  hovvr-w,  that  the  j</span><span>  puncely  possédions,  of  Moreton  Bay  aie</span><span>  after  all  the  gi  eat  fun!  by  which  the</span></p> <p><span>  liquid  ition  of  flic  colonial  debt  is  to  be  I</span><span>  eflected.  ï'be  ""  cloud  rising  in  the  hori-</span><span>  zon-the  threatened  dibmemberbent  of</span><span>  the  colony""-was  ""  most  emphatically</span><span>  protested  against,""-and  the  protest  was,</span><span>  of  course,  received  with  cheero;  for  upon</span><span>  this,  at  least,  theie  is  harmony  in  the</span><span>  House.

The  expected  despatches  re-</span><span>  lating  to  the  Separation  of  Moreton  Bay</span><span>  luve  not  yet  been  received.  This  delay</span><span>  will  afford  time  for  the  reception  of  all</span><span>  that  may  have  been  urged  against  our</span><span>  claims  by  the  Sydney  Government  ;  but</span><span>  as  it  will  also  give  time  for  the  receipt  of</span><span>  our  own  response,  we  have  full  confidence</span></p> <p><span>  in  the  issue.  Mr.  E.  DEAS  THOMSON'S</span></p> <p><span>  representations  on  the  subject  of  the  pro-</span><span>  posed  boundary,  in  spite  of  that  gentle-</span><span>  man's  qualifying  remarks  as  to  the  ab-</span><span>  sence  of  official  documents  for  reference,</span><span>  will  have  been  received  as  the  confiden-</span></p> <p><span>  tial  opinion  of  an  officer  who  for  very</span><span>  many  years  may  be  said  to  have  governed</span><span>  this  country.  While  protesting  against</span><span>  the  inclusion  of  New  England  in  the  pro-</span><span>  posed  colony,  Mr.  THOMSON  acknowledged</span><span>  tbo  geographical  propriety  of  connecting</span><span>  the  Clarence  with  Moreton  Bay,  and  bore</span><span>  testimony  to  the  ability  of  the  Northern</span><span>  colonists  to  form  a  Council  of  their  own.</span><span>  These  two  facts,  together  with  the  official</span><span>  statement  of  the  amount  of  population  in</span><span>  the  north,  will  be  sufficient  to  determine</span><span>  the  question,  which,  indeed,  is  now  on  all</span><span>  hands  acknowledged  to  be  settled.  The</span><span>  despatch  of  Mr.  LABOUCHERE  might  have</span><span>  prepared  us  for  some  little  delay,  for  it</span><span>  was  necessary  to-have  the  advice  of  the</span><span>  Governor-General  and  Executive  Council,</span><span>  respecting  the  division  of  the  territorial</span><span>  debt  between  New  South  Wales  and  the</span><span>  new  colony.  Our  readers  will  now  see</span><span>  Hie  sound  policy  of  the  activity  which  we</span><span>  advised  in  endeavoring  to  procure  the  ira</span><span>  luP'KlÄP  fäW®ßÜF9uSL  fefíJS?.  voted</span></p> <p><span>  .The  delay  of  the  expected  despatch</span><span>  may  he  further  attributable  to  the  unex-</span><span>  pected  embarrassments  of  the  ministry.</span><span>  If  00,  this  cause  may  not  have  ceased  to</span><span>  operate  by  the  timo  of  the  next  mail</span><span>  steamer's  departure  from  England.  Our</span><span>  readers  ave  aware  that  the  government  of</span><span>  Lord  PALMERSTON  had  sustined  a  defeat</span><span>  in  the  House  of  Commons,  on  a  motion</span><span>  brought,  forward  by  Mr  COBDEN,  con-</span><span>  demnatory  of  the  war  in  China.  This</span><span>  defeat  was  not  anticipated,  it  having  been</span><span>  confidently  expected  that  a  majority  of</span><span>  twenty-five,  at  least,  would  have  been  on</span><span>  th""  other  side.  But  the  ministry  was</span><span>  opposed  by  all  classes  of  politicians.  Mr.</span><span>  DISRAELI,  Mr.  ROEBUCK,  and  Lord  JOHN</span><span>  RUSSELL  siding  with  COBDEN.  Tho  mo-</span><span>  tion,  which  was  tantamount  to  a  censure</span><span>  upon  ministers,  was  carried  by  a  majority</span><span>  of  sixteen-a  result  which  is  said  to  have</span><span>  not  more  astonishod  the  Government  than</span></p> <p><span>  llio  strangely'  heterogeneous  opposition,</span><span>  the  conservative  allies  of  which  expected</span><span>  nutliing  more  than  to  give  a  blow  to  the</span><span>  ministry,  without  breaking  it  up.  The</span><span>  consequences  have  boon  still  moro  annoy-</span><span>  ing  lo  them,  for  Lord  PALMERSTON  had</span><span>  le^olved  upon  a  dissolution  of  Parliament,</span><span>  diid  an  appeal  to  the  country.  Tho  Gc</span><span>  tic-,  al  Election  was  expected  to  take  place</span><span>  about  the  end  of  Maroh,  and  the  new</span><span>  Parliament  would  meei  in  May.  In  the</span><span>  iíK""iütime,  as  there  was  pressing  business</span><span>  to  dispose  of,  the  parliamentary  session</span><span>  was  proceeding.  Opinions  were  various.</span><span>  It  was  considered  tolerably  certain  at  first</span><span>  that  an  appeal  to  the  country  would  give</span><span>  I  AH  »i  PALMERSTON  a  largo  majority,  and</span><span>  a  moro  firm  and  compact  party  thap  ho</span><span>  had  hitherto  had  j  for  tho  war  with  China</span><span>  is  decidedly  not  unpopular,  and  many</span><span>  look  upon  the  Premier  as  an  injured  man.</span><span>  L.tcr  opinions  inclined  to  the  probability</span><span>  ol'  another  and  more  decisivo  attaok  beiug</span><span>  mule  before  the  dissolution,  in  order  to</span><span>  drive  tho  ministry  from  office  if  possible,</span><span>  and  thus  save  the  inconvenienco,  expense,</span><span>  and  risk  of  a  Qbneral  Election,  to  the  Con</span><span>  nonutive  party  in  particular.  Should</span><span>  hitch  au  attack  bo  made,  and  be  success-</span><span>  ful,  there  scorned  no  party  to  rely  upon</span><span>  as  successors  of  the  ministry  but  the  rem-</span><span>  nant  of  the  old  Whigs.  Lord  JOHN</span><span>  RUSSELL  lins  boen  daily  drawing  nearer</span><span>  to  the  Manchester  Behool.  Should  he  bo</span></p> <p><span>  awaiti  intrusted  wjth  power,  it  is  quito</span><span>  possible  that  COBDEN  may  be  associated</span><span>  with  him.  Such  an  alliauco,  however</span><span>  welcome  it  might,  be  in  some  of  tho  thick-</span><span>  ly  pi-tuilated  manufacturing  towns,  would</span><span>  not  have  the  hearty  approval  of  England.</span><span>  Tlio  Conservative  party,  on  the  other</span><span>  hand,  seem  to  be  ineapabjo  of  construct-</span><span>  ing  a  ministry,  oven  should  they  havo  nu</span><span>  opi  a  I  unity  of  attemptiug.  This,  how</span><span>  uvi-r,  js  mere  speculation.  .  The  greater</span><span>  probability  ia,  that  minis  tors  would  hold</span><span>  llictr  own  until  the  dissolution,  and  that</span><span>  the  olToot  of  the  General  Elüctjon  would</span><span>  bo  lo  strengthen  Lord  PALMERSTON'S</span><span>  position.</span></p> <p><span>  It  ii  remarkablo  that,  ia  tho  House  of</span><span>  Tinrrl  i,  which  might  not  have  boen  counted</span><span>  upon  as  favorable  to  the  Promier,  a  similar</span><span>  motton  to  that  of  Mr.  COBDEN  in  tho</span></p> <p><span>  Coiiiino.is  was  brought  forward  by  Lord.</span><span>  DuiUiV,  aud,  although  supported  by  Lords</span></p> <p><span>  fyffllMVBW  ftjjd,  Sj,  L^NAttPfy  m]  %</span></p> <p><span>  Bishop  of  OXFORD^.waa""tejeotecl  by  a.</span><span>  majority  of  thirty-six.  The""  fact  proves</span><span>  that  Lord  PALMERSTON  still  depends  for</span><span>  support  upon  the  intrinsic  force  of  his</span><span>  own  character,  and  his  thoroughly  Eng-</span><span>  lish  ideas,  instead  of  mere  party.  At  the</span><span>  same  time,  there  is  much  inconsistency</span><span>  to  be  found  in  the  policy  of  the  sturdy</span><span>  old  politician,  and  this  his  enemies  are  ¡</span><span>  by  no  means  reluotant  to  lay  bare.  His</span><span>  tamo  consent  to  a  mere  remonstrance  in</span><span>  the  case  of  Naples  does  indeed  strangely</span><span>  contrast  with  his  fiery  zeal  formerly  in</span><span>  the  case  of  M.  PACIFICO.  But  it  must</span><span>  be  remembered  that  the  Prime  Minister</span><span>  of  England  cannot  always  carry  out  his</span><span>  own  dearest  wishes,  but  must  at  times</span><span>  place  those  under  painful  restraints,  in</span><span>  obedience  to  the  dictates  of  prudence.</span><span>  No  doubt  the  Emperor  of  the  French,</span><span>  notwithstanding  many  strong  temptations</span><span>  to  the  contrary,  has  hitherto  had  the  good</span><span>  sense  to  maintain  faith  in  his  engage-</span><span>  ments  with  England,  and,  this  being  the</span><span>  case,  England  is  bound  jo  listen  to  his</span><span>  suggestions  as  to  the  adoption  of  any</span><span>  policy  which  might  create  disorder  in  his</span><span>  dominions,  or  endanger  the  throne  to</span><span>  which  England  has  acknowledged  his</span><span>  right.  And  if  active  interference  in  the</span><span>  affairs  of  Naples  or  Italy  would  enoourage</span><span>  revolutionists  in  Fiance,  allowance  must</span><span>  be  made  for  Lord  PALMERSTON'S  position,</span><span>  and  his  desire  to  maintain  good  relations</span><span>  with  his  favorite  ally.  ""Wo  are  by  no</span><span>  means  strong  in  faith  as  to  the  perma-</span><span>  nence  of  this  alliance,  although  it  should</span><span>  be  preserved  as  long  as  possible;  and</span><span>  hence  arises  another  complication  of  the</span><span>  Italian  question.  If,  unfortunately,  any</span><span>  circumstance  should  arise  to  cause  a</span></p> <p><span>  rupture  with  France,  an  immediate  and</span><span>  cordial  alliance  would,  doubtlessly,  be</span><span>  formed  between  that  country  and  Russia,</span><span>  and  Prussia  would  probably  be  disposed</span><span>  to  join  it,  unless  prevented  by  the  per-</span><span>  sonal  relations  about  to  be  established</span><span>  with  our  Court  by  marriage.  At  all</span><span>  events,  such  an  alliance  would  be  for-</span><span>  midable  in  a  military  point  of  view,  and</span><span>  it  woulol  not  be  desirable,  by  injudicious</span><span>  activity  in  Italian  affairs,  to  array  Austria</span></p> <p><span>  also  on  their  side.  Some  such  considera-</span><span>  tions  as  these  have,  in  all  probability,</span><span>  had  their  weight  with  Lord  PALMERSTON,</span><span>  as  they  should  also  have  with  those  who</span><span>  censuro  him.  It  may  sound  very  well</span><span>  to  condemn  mere  expediency;  but  al-</span><span>  though  it  is  distressing  to  reflect  upon</span><span>  the  political  slavery  of  the  Italian  States,</span><span>  it  would  be  still  more  distressing  if  Eng-</span><span>  land,  thiough  rash  statesmanship  and</span><span>  ultra-Quixotism,  should  ever  lessen  the</span><span>  power  she  now  has  of  protecting  her  own</span><span>  subjects  from  similar  degradation.  Loid</span></p> <p><span>  PALMERSTON  has  shown  himself  firm  in</span></p> <p><span>  supporting  the  independence  of  the  King</span><span>  of  Sardinia,  in  whom  the  Italians  would</span><span>  be  wise  to  recognise  their  leader  and  their1</span><span>  example.  ""</span></p> <p><span>  The  war  in  China  is  to  be  carried  on</span><span>  with  vigour.  General  PENNEI?  ITIIER,  has</span><span>  been  appointed  Commander-in-Chief  of</span><span>  the  troops,  and  the  Earl  of  ELGIN,  for-</span><span>  merly  Governor-General  of  Canada,  has</span><span>  been  sent  out  as  Plenipotentiary  on  the</span><span>  part  of  England.  Now  that  the  sword</span><span>  relinquished  merely'up'onMie  seloYonient</span><span>  of  the  ostensible  cause  of  quarrel.  Eng-</span><span>  land  is  backed  up  by  other  nations  in  the</span><span>  opinion  that  advantage  should  be  taken</span><span>  of  the  present  occasion  to  enforce  free</span></p> <p><span>  commerce  and  international  intercourse</span><span>  in  China.  It  Avould  have  been  difficult</span><span>  to  Belect  a  bettor  man  than  Lord  ELGIN</span><span>  for  the  task  intrusted  to  him.  At  one</span><span>  time,  indeed,  his  heart  failed  him  in</span><span>  Canada.  Broken-spiiited  and  disgusted</span><span>  at  the  opposition,  and  even  peisonal  ill</span><span>  treatment,  which  he  met  with,  he  tendered</span><span>  his  resignation  ;  but  this  Eail  GREY,  then</span></p> <p><span>  Colonial  Secretary,  refused  to  accept,  and  .</span><span>  the  result  was  that  Lord  ELWIN  remained</span><span>  long  enough  in  his  vice-royalty  to  witness</span><span>  the  establishment  of  peace,  prosperity,</span><span>  and  full  responsible  government  in  the</span><span>  Canadas  In  his  new  field  of  action  he</span><span>  will  have  the  advantage  of  the  experience</span><span>  of  Sir  JOHN  BOWUINO,  whom  he  is  not</span><span>  to  supersede  but  to  co-operate  with.  It  is</span><span>  expected  that,  when  General  PENNEFA-</span><span>  THER  has  organised  his  forces  and  is  ready</span><span>  for  the  field,  and  the  naval  reinforcements</span><span>  aro  ""  complete,  Lord  ELGIN  will  lay  his</span><span>  demands  before  the  Court  of  Pekin,  and</span><span>  authorise  immediate  measures  of  force  if</span></p> <p><span>  they  be  not  conceded.  In  all  probability</span><span>  the  Emperor,  with  a  powerful  and  almost</span><span>  triumphant  rebellion  in  his  own  domi-</span><span>  nions,  will  bo  constrained  to  accept  the</span><span>  proposals  offered.  If  not,  there  will  be  a</span><span>  war  in  which  undoubtedly  the  bloodshed</span><span>  «lust  rho  great,  for,  though  poor  soldiers,</span><span>  th?

The  Times</span><span>  ingeniously  disposes  of  the  complaints</span><span>  about  the  opium  trade.  Opium,  the</span><span>  great  journal  says,  has  been  shown  to  be</span><span>  absolutely  necessary  to  the  Chinese,  from</span><span>  habit,  and  beneficial  if  used  in  moderation.</span><span>  The  great  mortality  that  occurred  in  a  cer-</span><span>  tain  Chinese  passenger-ship  was  traced  to</span><span>  the  insufficiency  of  the  opium  supply</span><span>  This  necessary  article  the  Chinóse  rulers</span><span>  wished  to  keep  a  monopoly  of.  What</span><span>  then  would  be  thought  of  England  if  she</span><span>  suddenly  shut  her  ports  against  the  gin</span><span>  of  Holland,  tho  brandy  of  France,  and</span><span>  tho  wines  of  Spain  and  Portugal,  on  the</span><span>  plea  that  some  of  the  English-a  great</span><span>  number  indeed-abuse  the  use  of  those</span><span>  liquids?  The  present  war,  however,  is</span><span>  not  about  opium,  although  the  freedom  of</span><span>  commoron  generally  is  very  much  con-</span><span>  cerned.  A  late  report,  by  way  of  Mel-</span><span>  bourne,  stated  that  a  division  had  taken</span><span>  place  in  the  couuoils  of  the  so-oalled</span><span>  Ohinoso  rebels,  a  party  of  whom  had  gone</span><span>  over  to  tho  Imperialists.  It  is  by  no</span><span>  means  improbablo,  as  overtures  from  the</span><span>  same  party  had  boforo  boen  made  to  the</span><span>  British,  and  rejooted.</span></p> <p><span>  The  settlement  of  the  Persian  question</span><span>  is  satisfactory.  Herat  is  to  be  given  up</span><span>  Jo  the  independent  government  of  its  own</span></p> <p><span>  cWefy  lind,  i^hjre  ja  tfmn.  to  bofyftouajgd,</span></p> <p><span>  í</span></p> <p><span>  a_]  by  the  British.  England  is  to  .be  allowed</span></p> <p><span>  the  same  privileges  in  Persia  as  any  other</span><span>  nation.  This  will  serve  as  a  check  upon</span><span>  Russian  influence.  In  exchange  for  this</span><span>  concession,  England  abandons,  as  of  course</span><span>  she  ought  to  do,  all  claim  to  protection</span><span>  over  Persian  subjects.  Mr.  MURRAY,</span><span>  whose  interference  on  behalf  of  a  lady</span><span>  caused  that  first  misunderstanding  which</span><span>  Russia  was  so  anxious  to  improve,  is  to</span><span>  be  received  at  the  Persian  Court,  with</span><span>  honor  ;  a  stipulation  which  will  certainh</span><span>  be  humiliating  to  the  Sohah.  There  can</span></p> <p><span>  be  no  doubt  but  that  the  firmness  o</span><span>  France  in  her  alliance  has  thus  far  as</span><span>  s  sisted  in  foiling  Russia.  The  treaty  wa</span></p> <p><span>  executed  in  Paris,  and  an  armistice  was'</span><span>  proclaimed,  to  allow  time  for  the  ratifi-</span></p> <p><span>  cation.</span></p> <p><span>  The  only  other  circumstance  in  the</span><span>  late  news  that  calls  for  particular  remark</span><span>  here,  is  the  fact  of  a  letter  having  been</span><span>  addressed  to  the  Times,  by  a  Mr.  WIL-</span><span>  LIAM  GOSLING  MOORE,  in  which  that</span><span>  gentleman  takes  it  upon  himself  to  re-</span><span>  commend  the'forwarding  of  convicts  to</span><span>  Moreton  Bay,  for  the  cultivation  of  cot-</span><span>  ton.  He  complains  that  an  application</span><span>  to  the  Government  on  the  subject  had</span><span>  not  been  attended  with  any  satisfactory</span><span>  result,  but  thinks  that,  independently  of</span><span>  the  convict  part  of  tho  proposal,  the  mat-</span><span>  ter  is  well  worthy  of  consideration.  So</span><span>  we  think  also  ;  but  it  is  amusing  to  ob-</span><span>  serve  the  perfect  coolness  with  which  3ome</span><span>  people  appropriate  the  ideas  of  others.</span><span>  The  merit  of  the  cotton  suggestion  is</span><span>  undoubtedly  due  to  Dr.  LANG.  Mr.</span><span>  MOORE'S  proposal  for  the  employment  of</span><span>  convicts  he  is  welcome  to  all  the  credit</span><span>  of.  Wo  want  no  such  importations  here,</span><span>  nor  will  the  inhabitants  ever  tolerate</span><span>  them.</span></p> <p><span>  Although  the  sanguine  may  have  been</span><span>  disappointed  by  the  non-arrival  of  the</span><span>  Separation  despatch,  they  should  not  per-</span><span>  mit  the  delay  to  engender  apathy.

The  statement  is  that</span><span>  some  young  man,  now  undergoing  punish-</span><span>  ment  for  an  offence  against  the  laws,  has</span><span>  made  a  confession  to  his  clergyman,  in</span><span>  which,  he  declares  that  he  for  a  consider-</span><span>  able  time.  formed  one  of  a  society  existing</span><span>  in  the  far  interior,  and  composed  of  run</span><span>  away  white  men,  aboriginal  women,  and</span></p> <p><span>  their  children  ;  that  these  people  grew</span><span>  their  own  wheat  and  ground  it  in  steel</span><span>  mills  ;  that  they  were  in  possession  of</span><span>  large  flocks  and  herds:  had  located  them-</span><span>  selves  on  the  banks  of  a  large  river  ;  and</span><span>  procured  such  necessaries  as  they  did  not</span><span>  possess  by  conveying  them  from  a  distance</span><span>  on  pack-horses.  These  people,  he  says,</span><span>  fell  in  with  Dr.  LEICHHARDT,  and  made</span><span>  him  and  all  his  companions  prisoners,  in</span><span>  which  position  they  remained  two  years</span><span>  ago.  No  doubt  the  narrator  of  this  ro-</span><span>  mantic  tale  would  be  glad  to  exchange</span><span>  his  present  position  for  that  of  a  guide  to</span><span>  a  searohing  party,  trusting  to  ingenuity</span><span>  and  chance  for  an  opportunity  of  enlarg-</span><span>  ing  his  freedom.  We  do  not  forget  what</span><span>  colonial  history  tells  us—that  a  poor  con-</span><span>  vict  was  once  flogged  for  declaring  that  he</span><span>  had  found  native  gold,  which  in  all  proba-</span><span>  bility  was  the  truth  ;  but  this  story  con-</span><span>  cerning  Leichhardt  exceeds  the  bounds</span><span>  of  all  reasonable  probability.  Those  villa-</span><span>  gers  of  the  wilderness  are  said  to  be  in</span><span>  possession  of  books,  and  to  have  employed</span><span>  Leichhardt  as  a  schoolmaster  to  their</span><span>  children.  The  idea  that  any  number  of</span><span>  lawless  men,  seeking  only  escape  from  the</span><span>  consequences  of  crime,  would  remain  in</span><span>  a  position  of  this  kind  while  they  knew,</span><span>  them,  that  every  facility  now  existed  for</span><span>  their  undetected  return  to  civilised  life  ;</span><span>  for  their  participation  in  the  chances  of</span><span>  the  gold-fields,  or  for  their  departure  from</span><span>  the  colony,  is  simply  preposterous.  Equal</span><span>  ly  improbable  is  it  that  the  native  blacks</span><span>  would  fraternise  with  them  in  such  a  way</span><span>  of  life  ;  and  tolerably  certain  is  it  that  a</span><span>  secret  of  this  nature  would  have  been</span><span>  long  since  tracked  out  by  outriding  stock-</span><span>  men  or  garrulous  natives.  The  tale,</span><span>  however,  such  as  it  is,  has  been  submitted</span><span>  to  the  consideration  of  the  Government,</span><span>  with  further  particulars  not  yet  made</span><span>  public;  and  there  the  matter  rests.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  chief  reason  for  adverting  in  this</span><span>  place  to  the  report  in  question  arises  from</span><span>  the  hope  that  it  may  give  a  fresh  stimulus</span><span>  to  the  search  for  the  unfortunate  Au-</span></p> <p><span>  stralian  explorer.  We  have  repeatedly</span><span>  expressed  our  conviction  that,  whatever</span><span>  may  have  been  the  fate  of  Leichhardt,</span><span>  all  the  inquiries  hitherto  instituted  into</span><span>  that  mystery  have  ended  most  unsatis-</span><span>  factorily.  An  expedition  into  the  in-</span><span>  terior  of  this  continent  is  undoubtedly  not</span><span>  so  agreeable  a  recreation  as  an  afternoon</span><span>  walk  in  the  Government  Gardens;  but</span><span>  when  we  think  of  what  Dr.  Rae  has  done</span><span>  and  what  Livingstone  has  but  recently</span><span>  accomplished,  the  difficulties  attending  a</span><span>  further  search  for  Leichhardt  appear</span><span>  far  from  formidable  to  Anglo-Saxon</span><span>  energy.  Mr.  Hely's  investigations  may</span><span>  have  satisfied  his  own  mind,  but  they</span><span>  have  not  satisfied  the  public,  and  that</span><span>  was  the  object  of  his  journey.  Neither</span><span>  have  we  derived,  as  might  have  been  ex</span><span>  pected,  any  information  on  this  point,</span><span>  from  the  more  recent  enterprise  of  Mr</span><span>  Gregory.  That  expedition  has  added</span><span>  little  to  our  previous  knowledge,  and</span><span>  appears  to  have  left  even  the  question  of</span><span>  the  existence  of  gold-fields  in  the  neigh-</span><span>  borhood  of  the  Lynd  and  the  Burdekin,</span><span>  as  it  was  before.</span></p> <p><span>  Some  time  ago  a  suggestion  was  thrown</span><span>  out  for  the  employment  of  a  party  of</span><span>  Native  Policemen  in  any  future  search</span><span>  for  Dr.  Leichhardt  ;  and  we  are  inclined</span><span>  to  think  that  they  would  be  found  most</span><span>  useful  auxiliaries.  In  discovering  water-</span><span>  ing  places  for  encampments,  tracking</span><span>  strayed  horses  or  bullocks,  guarding</span><span>  against  surprises  by  hostile  natives,  and</span><span>  almost  instinctively  detecting  the  traces</span><span>  of  any  previous  traveller,  these  men  would</span><span>  bo  invaluable.  With  a  hardy,  intrepid,</span><span>  and,  above  all,  zealous  leader,  and  a  well</span><span>  selected  and  well  equipped  party  of  sturdy</span><span>  bushmen,  a  company  might  thus  be  formed</span><span>  from  whom  something  satisfactory  could</span><span>  be  confidently  expected.  As  the  case  stands</span><span>  at  present,  a  deep  reproach  rests  upon</span><span>  the  colonists;  a  reproach  applying  not</span><span>  only  to  their  liberality,  but  also  to  their</span><span>  courage.  Leichhardt  was  willing  to</span><span>  risk  his  life  in  the  cause  of  science  for</span><span>  Australia,  but  Australia  does  not  produce</span><span>  a  man  who  will  risk  anything  to  follow</span><span>  on  his  track.  That  is  the  practical  fact</span><span>  of  the  case,  although  there  may  be  many</span><span>  men  who  would  go  if  able.  It  may  well</span><span>  be,  indeod,  that  poor  Leichhardt  is  past</span><span>  all  earthly  care.  Yet  his  existence  is</span><span>  quite  within  the  range  of  probability,</span><span>  The  only  warrant  for  believing  him  dead</span><span>  is  the  blackfellows'  tale  of  Bundarabella</span><span>  Creek.  If  the  alleged  slaughter  were</span><span>  really  perpetrated  there,  some  trace  or</span><span>  relic  of  the  murdered  men  might  yet  be</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  found.  The  present  state  of  uncertainty</span><span>  is,  we  repeat,  discreditable  to  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  While  it  exists,  such  tales  as  that  made</span></p> <p><span>  public  by  ""  Z""  will  over  and  anon  be  told,</span></p> <p><span>  and  at  intervals  there  will  continue  re-</span><span>  newals  of  that  public  anxiety  which  any</span></p> <p><span>  more  vigorous  government  than  our  own</span><span>  would  have  long  since  set  at  rest.</span></p> ",Article,1857-05-02,"THE Moreton Bay Courier.

It  »vas  a  quarterly  meeting,  and</span><span>  the  members  had  a  right  to  expect  one  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Vice-Presi  lents,  if  not  the  President  himself,  .</span><span>  should'be  in  his  place.

As  to  Uie  other  vice,  all  that</span><span>  can  be  said  about  him  is-that  where  little  eau  he</span><span>  done,  little  is  to  be  expected.  The  Treasurer</span><span>  would  be  quite  a,  rara  avis  in  the  ball,  and  the</span><span>  visita  of  the  President  nie  not  so  frequent  as  they</span><span>  ought  to  be,  nlthouirii  I  must  admit  that  the  gen-</span><span>  tleman  does  »vhat  he  can,  by  contributions  of</span><span>  books,  «to.,  for  the  fuithereuce  of  the  institution.</span><span>  There  are  some  fi»-o  or  six  of  iho  committee  who</span><span>  are  always  to  be  found  in  their  places,  by  whom</span><span>  all  the  work  is  done,  and  »\ho  really  deserve  some</span><span>  little  credit.  One  really  active  and  zealous  officer</span><span>  would,  if  seconded  ¡ii  his  efforts  by  I  he  members,</span><span>  raise  this  institution  to  its  legitimate  status.</span><span>  No»»*,  it  is  nothing  more  than  a  common  reading</span></p> <p><span>  room.  -  *</span></p> <p><span>  At  the  meeting  on  Thursday  some  allusions</span><span>  »vere  made  to  lectures  which  were  promised  and</span><span>  never  ¡¡¡ven.  One  member  of  (he  Committee  who</span><span>  ""put  his  name  down""  said  he  hod  »vith-held  his</span><span>  lecture  because  of  the  paucity  of  attendance  at</span><span>  others  ;  while  another  member  said  that  be  »vonld</span><span>  give  his  when  he  could  deliver  one  worth  paying</span><span>  a  shilling  to  hear.

We</span><span>  ought,  thorefore,  to  provide  the  means  of  hearty,</span><span>  healthful,  mental  industry,  for  the  young  in  their  leaisure  hours</span><span>  thus  giving  them  the  means  of</span><span>  growing  up  with  a  sound  mind,  and  sound  body,</span><span>  and  saving  them  from  the  vicious  influences  of  the</span><span>  wayside  groups  of  idlers  whose  language  is  often</span><span>  a  disgrace  to  our  common  humanity,  as  well  as</span><span>  preventing  them  from  loitering  at  the  corners  of</span><span>  streets,  as  if  being  in  wait  for  evil.</span></p> <p><span>  Now,  by  no  means  within  our  reach  can  we  so</span><span>  well  accomplish  thisas  by  opening  among  our-</span><span>  selves  one  of  those  institutions  which  are  the  basis</span><span>  of  the  social  and  intellectual  progress  of  the  rising</span><span>  generation,  as  well  as  the  best  boon  left  us  by  the</span><span>  past  age,  for  the  amelioration  of  physical  evils.</span><span>  Separated  as  we  are  from  North  Brisbane  by  a</span><span>  broad  river,  and  a  long  distance  of  often  indifferent</span></p> <p><span>  streets,  the  institution  there  is  comparativelv</span><span>  of  little  use  to  us.  Our  families  cannot  attend</span><span>  the  lectures  and  the  debates  there  but  at  considerable</span><span>  exertion,  as  well  as  a  waste  of  time  and</span><span>  morey.  Our  young  men  cannot  stop  in  to  see</span><span>  the  papers  in  the  evening  when  they  have  a  leisure</span><span>  hour,  nor  can  we  enjoy  any  such  treat  ourselves</span><span>  but  at  the  expense  of  a  journey  that  few  of  us</span><span>  would  have  time  to  take.  Surely  it  is  necessary</span><span>  for  us  to  consider  whether  by  a  little  exertion  on</span><span>  our  part  we  could  not  have  a  reading  room  as  a</span><span>  nucleus  of  a  School  of  Arts  in  South  Brisbane,  be-</span><span>  ginning  with  a  suitable  variety  of  papers  and</span></p> <p><span>  periodicals,  and  proceeding  with  the  gradual  acc-</span><span>  cumulation  of  a  library.  We  are  bound  to  make</span><span>  some  such  exertion,  that  intelligence  may  grow</span><span>  grow  up  among  us;  that  we  may  know  something  of  what</span><span>  is  passing  in  the  world  around  us;  and  that  those</span><span>  who  wish  to  apply  themselves  to  knowledge  may</span><span>  supply  the  omission,  or  correct  the  defects  of  early</span></p> <p><span>  education.  If  we  thus  exert  ourselves  no  doubt</span></p> <p><span>  the  Government  will  deal  liberally  with  us,  and</span><span>  gentlemen  will  bo  found  who  will  give  us  lectures</span><span>  on  such  subjects  as  would  be  instructive  and  at</span></p> <p><span>  tractive.  Let  it  not  bo  said  that  we  confine  our-</span></p> <p><span>  selves  wholly  to  the  useful,  and  such  as  has  refer-</span></p> <p><span>  ence  only  to  the  bodily  and  the  material,  leaving</span><span>  our  minds  naked  and  hungry.</span><span>  Nor  would  our  exertions  injure  in  any  way  the</span><span>  institution  in  North  Brisbane,  those  among  us  who</span><span>  are  members  there  would  continue  to  be  be  still,</span></p> <p><span>  because  they  would  have  the  use  of  more  valuable</span><span>  works  than  we  could  for  some  time  be  able  to</span><span>  procure.

The  allusions  to  such</span><span>  a  matter  was  altogether  out  of  place  ;  it  was  un-</span><span>  just  to  Mr.  Holt  to  suppose  that  he  had  any  other</span></p> <p><span>  end  in  view  than  the  benefit  of  the  Bank.  The</span><span>  way  in  which  he  talked  of  ""  grasping  avarice,""  and</span><span>  ""threatened  ruin,""  when  ""every  man  was  afraid</span><span>  to  look  his  fellow  in  the  face,""  was  monstrous,  and</span><span>  created  more  surprise,  perhaps,  than  anything</span><span>  said  at  the  meeting.

"<p><span>  THE  TONGA  COTTON-TREE,-MISSION</span></p> <p><span>  ARIES  AND  COMMERCE.</span></p> <p><span>  of  I  To  the  Editor  of  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SIR,-In  your  last  issue  you  published  a  despatch</span><span>  from  her  Brittania  Mnjest}'s  Acting  Consul  at</span><span>  Baltimore,  by  which  ive  learn,  for  the  first  time,</span><span>  that  the  cotton-tree-yvhioh  might  become  an  im-</span><span>  portant  staple  product  in  this  district-grows</span><span>  spontaneously  at  Tonga,  an  Island  in  the  South</span></p> <p><span>  Pacific.</span></p> <p><span>  I  believe  that  a  Christian  mission  has  been  for</span><span>  some  years  established  by  British  subjects  at</span><span>  Tonga  ;  and  it  might  occasion  surprise  to  some</span><span>  thnt  hitherto  the  above  piece  of  information-so</span><span>  important  to  Great  Britain  ns  a  commercial  and</span><span>  manufacturing  nation-has  remained  wholly  un-</span><span>  known  until  the  present  moment  ;  and  lins  at</span><span>  length,  reached  us  through-  such  an  unexpected</span><span>  mid  apparently  unlikely  channel.  It  is  not  diffi-</span><span>  cult  to  discern  the  cause  of  this.  It  rosts  chiefly</span><span>  iii  what  I,  in  common  with  many  others,  feel  my-</span><span>  self  bound  to  regard  as  a  defect  in  the  missionary</span><span>  system.  Every  icligious  body,  whilst  endeavor-</span><span>  ing  to  spread  abroad  in  distant  countries  the</span><span>  tenets  of  its  peculiar  form  of  Christianity,  has</span><span>  forgotten  the  civilising  agency  of  commerce.</span><span>  Nay,  I  dare  affirm,  that  in  many  instances  there</span><span>  lins  been  a  stronger  inclination  to  discourage  than</span><span>  to  foster  trade.  The  artificial  -vants  and  evils</span><span>  which  undoubtedly  accompany  the  spread  of  Euro«</span><span>  pean  customs  and  civilisation,  do  not  seem  to  all</span><span>  minds  to  bo  counterbalanced  hy  the  great  advan</span><span>  nges  and  blessings  which  extended  commerce</span><span>  brings  to  the  larger  number.</span></p> <p><span>  Cmimorco  and  religion  have  been  looked  upon</span><span>  as  in  some  measure  antagonistic  to  ench  other,</span><span>  and  no  systematic  endeavor  has  been  made  to</span><span>  combine  the  blessings  of  the  two.  _  The  introduc-</span><span>  tion  of  agriculture  with  religion  into  Purnguay,</span><span>  by  tho  Jesuits  undoubtedly  exeroised  for  a  time</span><span>  a  beneficial  influence  upon  the  character  of  its  in-</span><span>  habitants  ;  but  their  commercial  relations  being  a</span><span>  monopoly  in  tho  hands  ol'  their  spiritunl  teachers,</span><span>  the  people  did  not  experience  the  direct  influence</span><span>  of  traffic  ;  and  when  tho  Jesuits  wore  driven  out</span><span>  in  17C8,  commerce,  and  agriculture  ivhich  is  sti-</span><span>  mulated  by  it,  received  a  death-blow.</span></p> <p><span>  Although  I  would  not  moko  tho  missionary  a</span><span>  merchant,  ho  might  devise  means  to  create  be-</span><span>  tween  theheathen  iiiidhis  civilised  brother  a  profit-</span><span>  able  commercial  intercourse.  The  missionary  is  not</span><span>  generally  adapted  to  cll'ect  this  purpose.  Science,</span><span>  art,  and  agriculture,  are  not  greatly  indebted  tohim.</span><span>  His  information  is  considerably  narrowed.  He  is</span><span>  fully  instructed  in  the  peculiar  religious  views  he</span><span>  has  been  sent  forth  to  tench  ;  but  his  education</span><span>  has  not  generally  proceeded  further:  mid  in</span><span>  branches  of  knowledge  calculated,  to  make  him</span><span>  useful  in  discovering  the  resources  of  a  now  coun-</span><span>  try  he^  is  wholly  ignorant.  There  are,  of  course,</span><span>  exceptions,  hut  this  may  bo  accepted  as  the  gonertl</span><span>  standard  of  attainment,  more  especially  among</span><span>  the  Protestant  missionaries.  .  Grow  ing  for  yearp,</span><span>  and  yva'sting  nt  his  door,  among  a  savage  people,</span><span>  is  a  tree,  which  had  the  missionary  known  its  na-</span><span>  ture,  woiildhave  been  in  his  hands  a  potent  lever</span><span>  to  raise  the  people  of  Tonga  into  an  industrious,</span><span>  thriving,  civilised,  mid,  I  venture  to  nssert,  Chris-</span><span>  tian  community.""

"<p><span>  OVERLOADING  OUR  STEAMERS.</span></p> <p><span>  To  the  Editor  of  the  Moreton  Bay  Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  SIB,-It  is  nt  all  times  a  most  unpleasant  duty  to</span><span>  censure  our  friends  for  their  faults.  But  we  must</span><span>  not  forget  our  duty  on  that  account.  The  matter</span><span>  I  wish  to  bring  beforo  the  public,  through  the</span><span>  ""medium  of  your  columns,  is  one  involving  very</span><span>  sar'.ous  consequences,  and  which  carno  under  my</span><span>  notice  on  Wednesday  last.</span></p> <p><span>  .  Happening  to  bavo  some  business  transaction</span><span>  with  Sydney,  I  was  on  board  the  Yarra  Yarra  just</span><span>  before  she  sailed,  when  I  was  astonished  to  find</span><span>  .  the  deck  crowded  up  with  cargo  to  such  an  extent</span><span>  .that  the  communication  between  the  fore  and</span><span>  after  part  of  the  vessel  was  almost  entirely  stop-</span><span>  ped-there  being  barely  room  for  a  mau  to  squeeze</span><span>  himself  past,  between  tho  paddle-box  and  the</span><span>  cargo.  And  as  if  the  steamer  authorities  really</span><span>  desired  the  loss  of  their  vessel,  there  were  not  loss</span><span>  than  six  bales  of  wool  placed  upon  the  bridge,</span><span>  close  to  tho  paddle-boxes,  and  tovered  over  loosely</span><span>  -with-a-tarpanlir-,.  In  addition  to  all  this  tlioro</span><span>  -  were,  ten  ,or  eloven  _bales  in  tho  fore  cabin,'  the</span></p> <p><span>  smell  and  heat  from  which  was  unbearable  ;  and</span><span>  yet  the  steerage  passengers  had  to  put  up  with  it</span><span>  or  remain  on  desk.  If  this  is  rot  a  gross  injus-</span><span>  tice  to  the  poor  creatures  who  aro  compelled  by</span><span>  necessity  to  travel,  in  this  way,  I  should  like  to</span></p> <p><span>  know  what  elso  to  call  it  ?</span></p> <p><span>  Now,  Sir,  will  it  be  believed  that  this  vessel  had</span><span>  on  her  deck  about  sixty  bales  of  wool,  and  with</span><span>  ?  what  was  on  the  bridge,-  and  in  the  fore  cabin,</span></p> <p><span>  ranking  a  total  ofsovonty-seven  bales-justhalf  a</span><span>  .  cargo  for  tho  Boomerang.</span></p> <p><span>  To  say  nothing  of  tho  illegality  of  taking  deck</span><span>  cargo  (for  you  must  bear  in  mind  that  it  is  a</span><span>  breach  of  the  Navigation  Laws)  there  can  be  no</span><span>  two  opinions  about  the  danger  of  it.  Just  think</span><span>  of  this  overloaded  steamer  in  such  weather  as  she</span></p> <p><span>  had  to  contend  against  on  tbo  night  when  the  ill</span><span>  fated  Dunbar  was  lost.  It  was  fortunate  for  the</span><span>  Yarra  Yarra  that  sho  had  no  cargo  on  deck  on</span><span>  that  eventful  night,  but  as  it  was,  she  rolled  and</span><span>  pitched  to  such  an  extent  that  the  stoutest  heart</span><span>  on  board  was  filled  with  anxiety,  and  the  wonder</span><span>  was  that  she  escaped  without  accident.  Who  can</span></p> <p><span>  duubt  tbo  result  if  she  encounters  such  weather</span></p> <p><span>  on  her  passage  to  Sydney  ?  It  makes  one  shudder</span><span>  at  the  thought  of  it.</span></p> <p><span>  It  will  no  doubt  be  snid  that  if  there  was  any</span></p> <p><span>  danger  apprehended  the  wool  would  be  thrown</span><span>  overboard.  But,  Sir,  if  the  wool  once  got  wet  it</span><span>  would  defy  all  tho  ollbrts  that  could  be  made  to</span><span>  get  a  bato  of  it  from  under  the  bridge.  It  took</span><span>  five  men  with  levers  to  jam  it  into  it»  place  when</span><span>  dry  and  the  vessel  steady-but  how  many  men</span><span>  would  it  take  to  get  it  out  when  wot  and  tho  ves-</span><span>  sel  rolling  about,  and  no  room  for  the  men  to</span></p> <p><span>  work?</span></p> <p><span>  It  seems  to  be  .the  feverish  anxiety  of  the  cap-</span><span>  tain  to  see  how  many  bales  of  wool  he  can  cram</span><span>  into  his  vessel  ;  and  the  feat  of  landing  four</span><span>  hundred  undumped  bales  on  the  wharf  at  Sydney</span><span>  would  be  greater  to  bim,  than  ""  beating  ten  Knaves</span><span>  in  Lincoln  Green,""-was  to  thegreat  Falstaff.</span></p> <p><span>  I  trust,  sir,  some  restraint  will  be  put  upon</span><span>  these  dangerous  efforts;  aud  that  a  greater  re</span><span>  ""  gard  to  human  life  will  be  enforced  by  those</span></p> <p><span>  whose  duty  it  is  to  see  to  these  matters.</span></p> <p><span>  I  remain  Sir,</span></p> <p><span>  Your  obedient  servant</span></p> <p><span>  A  LOOKER  ON'</span></p> ",Article,1857-12-19,OVERLOADING OUR STEAMERS.

I  would  also  extend  the  feinta</span><span>  about  100  feet  in  length,  and  tit  the  upper  end  of</span><span>  the  Reservoir  I  would  build  a  stone  wall,  to  be</span><span>  three  feet  alio  ve  ordinary  water  mark.  The  wall</span><span>  »houlii  huve  a  grating  a  little  from  the  bottom,</span><span>  alni  on  the  oiitsido  I  would  place  a  bank  of  sand,</span><span>  so  that  the  water  would  filter  through  it  at  all</span><span>  times  except  a  flood.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  Reservoir  itself  a  deal  of  denning  is  ne-</span><span>  cessary,  but  which  could  be  dona  tit  u  trilling  eos',</span><span>  onmpared  with  the  importance  it  is  to  the  health</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  inhabitants.</span></p> <p><span>  I  believe,  Sir,  the  supply  of  ivaler  is  the  first</span><span>  thought  of  the  founder  of  a  now  settlement,  -and</span><span>  wax  certainly  one  of  tim  first  things  that  the  late</span><span>  lamented  Sir  George  Gipps  gavo  his  attention  to</span><span>  when  ho  visited  this  town  immy  years  ago.
