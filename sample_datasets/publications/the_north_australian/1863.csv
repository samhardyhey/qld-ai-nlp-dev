"<p><span>  ©jje  Ijforij)  Australian:.</span><span>  SATURDAY,  NOVEMBER  3S.  1663.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Municipal  Corporatiou  of  Bris</span><span>  bane  has  not  deteriorated  in  vigor  since</span><span>  the  resignation  of  Messrs.  PetRIE,</span><span>  Teevan,  and  Wabbt.  The  operatious</span><span>  of  Captain  Towns  od  the  Ferry  bare</span><span>  been  summarily  met  and  disposed  of</span><span>  although  the  Captain  made  a  faint  at</span></p> <p><span>  tempt  at  imposing  a  condition  which  it</span><span>  did  not  rest  with  him  to  exact,  and  tbe</span><span>  City  Solicitor  had  no  power  to  assent  to.</span><span>  Tbe  establishment  of  a  Steam  Ferry  is</span><span>  a  matter  for  tbe  full  Corporation  to</span><span>  deal  with.  To  interfere  with  the</span><span>  powers  and  property  given  by  the  lav</span><span>  of  the  land  to  the  cily  vas  as  much</span><span>  beyond  any  legal  right  possessed  by</span><span>  him  as  it  was  opposite  to  good  taste  and</span><span>  common  Beuse.  It  is  bad  enough  urben</span><span>  a  pnblic  body  attempts  to  oppress  an  in</span><span>  dividual  —  for  an  individual  to  presume</span><span>  body  is  simply  monstrous.  It  seems  to</span><span>  show  that  some  men  may  acquire  a</span><span>  ereat  deal  of  property  only  to  over</span><span>  value  its  lights  and  under  estimate  its</span><span>  duties.  We  trust  to  see  so  re</span><span>  pititiou  of  so  unjustifiable  a  procedure.</span><span>  Tbe  result  of  the  election  has  served</span><span>  to  elicit  public  opinion  in  a  manner  so</span><span>  marked  as  to  admit  of  bat  one  inter</span><span>  pretation.  Not  only  did  the  bulk  of</span><span>  the  ratepayers  approve  of  the  action  .</span><span>  taken  by  the  Mayor,  but  they  most</span><span>  indubitably  disapproved  of  the  conduct</span><span>  of  his  opponents.  The  majority  in</span><span>  favor  of  Messrs.  Martin,  Hockikgs,</span><span>  and.  Beookeb  -was  so  great  as  to  be</span></p> <p><span>  really  a  vote  of  censure,  upon  Mr.</span><span>  CaiBB  and  his  patriotic  and  retiring</span><span>  friends.  Such  being  tbe  result,  we</span><span>  hope  that  they  irill  rest  satisfied,  with</span><span>  out  disturbing  the  peace  of.  a  commu</span><span>  nity  decidedly  hostile  to  their  views  by</span><span>  further  exhibitions  of  an  impotent</span><span>  wrath.  If  they  are  so  unadvised,  then</span><span>  it  becomes  the  duty  of  that  community</span><span>  to  'severely  let  them  .alone.'  To  do</span><span>  otherwise  would  be  a  sad  waste  of  time.</span><span>  And  it  being  the  inevitable  lot  of  men</span><span>  who  lug  behind  tbe  times  to  be  left  in</span><span>  the  rear,  it-  is  scarcely  worth  while</span><span>  looking  hack  to  see  how  tax  they  have</span><span>  been  outstripped  by  pnblic  opinion.</span><span>  Undoubtedly  the  Corporation  has  its</span><span>  work  before  it.  To  strengthen,  not  to</span><span>  vilify  —  to  uphold,  not  to  abuse  —  to  give</span><span>  credit  for  good  intentions,  not  meanly  to</span><span>  suspect  every  innovation  upon  a  time</span><span>  honored  apathy—  is  the  duty  of  every</span><span>  good  citizen  at  the  present  juncture.</span><span>  The  work  before  oar  Councillors  will</span><span>  task  their  skill  —  demand  their  utmost;</span><span>  industry,  and  call  for  a  sedate  but  vigi</span><span>  lant  circumspection.  To  encourage;</span><span>  them  in  (bis,  we  have,  while  not  meanly</span><span>  extolling  every  action,  to,  abstain  fan</span><span>  t^mmmMw  '  i  '  ?*'  tmmMKm^M</span><span>  men  and  -tbeir  mettares.  What  con</span><span>  test  iras  necessary  has  passed,  /and  the</span><span>  resnUl-eing  fixed,  why  prolong  unne</span><span>  cessarily  the  war  of  words  and  feel</span><span>  ings  t  Animosity  may  well  die  out</span><span>  with  its  cause,  and  the  man  who  would</span><span>  perpetuate  tbe  dissensions  which  ought</span><span>  now  to  be  forgotten  deserves  to  be</span><span>  ecouted  as  an  enemy  to  the  common</span><span>  prosperity.  Life  is  not  eo  long  nor  bo</span><span>  serene  to  the  great  maps  of  the  world</span><span>  thatjnen  should  devote  one-half  of  it</span><span>  to-crippling  other  people's  energies  ,*nd</span><span>  thai  wasting  their  own.  It  is  trac</span><span>  that  there  may  lie  some  men  to  whom</span><span>  tire^good  of.  all  the  world  would  be</span><span>  light  when  weighed  against  a  presumed</span><span>  advantage  to  themselves.

If  we  toust  have</span><span>  room  to  quarrel,  let  the  cause  be  found</span><span>  with  those  who  would  impede  our  ad</span><span>  vancement.

In  such</span><span>  a  cause,  dissent,  although  fixed,  be</span><span>  comes  gentle,  and  thus  acquires  a  more</span><span>  powerful  influence.  Men  are  easier</span><span>  persuaded  than  driven,  '  and  he  who</span><span>  would  coerce  into  submission,  dimply</span><span>  shows  how  foolishly  he  misappreciates</span><span>  jhe  very\  elements  of  our  common</span><span>  be  prosperous,  it  must  Tewuite^^rr</span><span>  be  united,  it  must  have  less  the  bond  of</span><span>  opinion  than  of  feeling.  Rightly  to</span><span>  make  a  friend,  we  must  learn  to  appre</span><span>  ciate  him  even  as  an  enemy.  Our</span><span>  citizens  having  learnt  and  practiced</span><span>  that  lesson,  we  have  no  doubt  of  the</span><span>  ultimate  honor  and  prosperity  of  tbe</span><span>  community.  To  forget  and  to  forgive  is,</span><span>  perhaps,  the  best  method  of  lessening</span><span>  the  causes  for  future  forbearance  —  in</span><span>  other  words,  of  the  dissension  which  is</span><span>  equally  damaging  in  the  end  to  public</span><span>  advantage  and  private  peace.</span><span>  ?  ?</span><span>  Before  another  issue  of  this  journal</span><span>  has  appeared,  the  land  adjoining  the</span><span>  Catholic  Church  site  in  Ipswich  will</span><span>  have  been  offered  for  sale.  The  discus</span></p> <p><span>  sion  which  has  taken  place  on  the  sub</span><span>  ject  of  its  sale,  and  the  spirit  in  whioh</span><span>  it  was  commenced,  must  long  be  remem</span><span>  bered  with  disagreeable  feeling,  regard</span><span>  less  of  any  result  which  it  may  produce</span><span>  on  the  sale.'*'  It  is  not  a  novel  argu</span><span>  ment  in  Ipswich  that  any  purpose</span><span>  which  erects  a  fine  building  for  the</span><span>  adornment  of  tbe  town,  and  locates</span><span>  there  an  institution  of  a  useful</span><span>  character,  and  au  extra  number  of  in</span><span>  habitants,  deserves  the  countenance  of</span><span>  the  community.  If  such  an  argument</span><span>  was  worth  anything  in  tbe  case  of  tbe</span><span>  Grammar  School,  it  is  certainly  not</span><span>  less  valuable  in  tiie  case  of  a</span><span>  Convent  and  Orphanage.  Its  de</span><span>  nominational  origin  cannot  affect</span><span>  its  value  in  these  respects.  But</span><span>  those  who  aimed  to  divert  the  land  from</span><span>  the  contemplated  use,  were  willing  to</span><span>  throw  aside  the  interest  of  the  town,</span><span>  provided  they  could  gratify  a  most  im</span><span>  proper  and  narrow-minded  sentiment  —</span><span>  a  sentiment  than  which  nooe  can  be</span><span>  more  mischievous  to  the  peace  and  in</span><span>  .LAr*u£  rtf  J  iflOfnfTHpi^F  ---  ?</span><span>  we  nave  not  beam  or  any  official</span><span>  reply  being  made  by  the  Government  to</span><span>  the  petition  of  the  Catholics  of  Ips</span><span>  wich,  requesting  that  the  land  re</span><span>  quired  should  be  sold  iu  one  block,</span><span>  and  at  the  lowest  upset  price  of  town</span><span>  lands  ;  but  we  have  heard,  on  reliable</span><span>  authority,  that  one  member  of  the  Ex</span><span>  ecutive  had  stated  that  the  request</span><span>  would  Hot  be  complied  with.  No  con</span><span>  sideration  could  have  ever  been  ex</span><span>  pected  from  that  gentleman,  and  al</span><span>  though  he  might  dissemble  to  suit  a</span><span>  purpose,  his  direction  of  the  organ  from</span><span>  which  the  calumny  and  the  objection</span><span>  came,  is  too  well-known  to  leave  a  doubt</span></p> <p><span>  that  the  outcry  was  raised  as  the  pre</span><span>  lude  to  the  refusal.  Neither  his  charity</span><span>  nor  bis  liberality  are  bo  marked  —  except</span><span>  for  pharasaical  display  —  as  to  prevent</span><span>  him  from  using  any  opportunity  of</span><span>  thwarting  those,  who  hare  honestly</span><span>  avowed  their  disapproval  of  his  rene</span><span>  gade  political  -career.  The  Catholics  of</span><span>  Ipswich  will  have  it  in  their  power  at</span><span>  no  distant  date,  to  mark  their  sense  of</span><span>  the  courtesy  of  a  Ministry,  most  of  its</span><span>  members  their  own  representatives,</span><span>  who  up  to  tbe  latest  date  had  not  even</span><span>  vouchsafed  a  reply  to  their  request.</span><span>  Building  on  the  ease  with  which,  some</span><span>  members  of  this  section  have  hitherto</span><span>  been  twisted  to  their  purpose,  when  re</span><span>  quired,  by  plausible  promises,  the</span><span>  actual  leader  of  the  Herbert  Minis</span><span>  try  believes  that  as  a  body  they  may</span><span>  be  insulted,  with  impunity  and  with</span><span>  perfect  safety  against  anything  like</span><span>  anity  of  action  on  their,  part  when</span><span>  such  is  .  called  for.  If  their  conduct</span><span>  has  given  reason  for  such  a  conclusion,</span><span>  they  are  but  justly  treated  in  reaping  its</span><span>  fruit.  It  may  be  that  k  greater  service</span><span>  could  not  be  conferred  upon  them,</span><span>  than  to  ehow  them  the  estimation  iu</span><span>  ?^Whft  yflojtftwlaijwna  -  So'*Othfir.JBeottQ:U  -OE</span><span>  the  Jieople  could  be  :  bo  treatea''nlfiiout</span><span>  good  reason.  jutd-  regard  to  the  future</span><span>  consequences  oFtsoch  a  slight  ;  forriight</span><span>  it  must  be  cousidBred,  to  leave  the  fip</span><span>  plication  bo  long  in  abeyance,  whether</span><span>  the  reply  was  .adverse  or  otherwise.</span><span>  There  is  some  consolation  in  the  feet,</span><span>  that  notwithstanding  the  conduct  of  the</span><span>  Government,  and  the  organ  of  one  of</span><span>  its  members,  after  all  the  power  to</span><span>  (rostrate  the  intention  of  the  Ipswich</span><span>  MOatbolics,  in  obtaining  the'site  for  the</span><span>  purpose  for  which  if  is  intended,  rests</span><span>  with  tin  public..

In  such  a  case</span><span>  the  credit  of  a  colony  is  represented  by</span><span>  the  probable  increase  in  its  income,  for</span><span>  the  number  of  years  during  which  the</span><span>  loan  has  to  run.

In  that  case,  how  much  will</span><span>  be  left  for  other  requirements-  f</span><span>  If  we  take  increase  in  the  numbers</span><span>  of  human  beings  as  a  criterion  of  set</span><span>  tlement,  the  Logan  undoubtedly  has</span><span>  great  claims.  Cotton  companies,  co</span><span>  operative  and  proprietary,  are  fast</span><span>  waxing  strong  and  growing  into</span><span>  productiveness,  and  the  small  farmers</span><span>  are  multiplying  day  by  day.

The  history  of  the  appointment</span><span>  is  edifying  —  the  conclusion  worthy  of</span><span>  public  attention.  For  the  improvement</span><span>  df  public  men,  and  in  the  interest  of  pub</span><span>  lic  morality,  we  briefly  glance  at  its</span><span>  prominent  incidents.</span><span>  When  after  the  advent  of  Separation</span><span>  it  became  necessary  to  elect  members  of</span><span>  parliament,  South  Brisbane  had  two</span><span>  candidates  presented  for  its  choice.  Of</span><span>  these  one  was  Mr.  Henry  Richards,</span></p> <p><span>  then  representative  of  the  well-known</span><span>  firm  of  Towns  &  Co.,  and  in  that</span><span>  position  worthily  worshiped  by  that</span><span>  community.  Of  (fee  fitness  of  his  op</span><span>  ponent  we  «ay  noming;  they  might</span><span>  fyisstDry  have  been  well  matched,  but</span><span>  the  firm  of  Towns  &  Co.  carried  the</span><span>  day.  By  a  large  majority  Mr.  Richakds</span><span>  was  returned,  and  being  the  choice  of</span><span>  South  Brisbane  did  honor  to  their</span><span>  choosing.</span><span>  Of  coursehis  principles  were  liberal  —</span><span>  liberal  enough  to  have  met  the  exigency</span><span>  of  that  candidate  who  at  the  last  general</span><span>  would  have  Bald  and  did  not  mean  into</span><span>  connected  and  grammatical  form.  So</span><span>  exceedingly  comprehensive  were  his</span><span>  ideas  that  he  could  never  find  words  to</span><span>  express  them.  So  he  sat  in  almost  un</span><span>  broken  silence  and  voted  as  became  him.</span><span>  In  the  first  instance,  once  or  twice  he</span><span>  voted  against  the  Ministry,  but  in  time</span><span>  a-  change  came  o'er  the  spirit  of  his</span><span>  dream,  and  he  became  consistent  —  con-</span><span>  sistent  in  two  things  :  in  the  pursuit  of</span><span>  place,  and  in  undeviating  service  to  de</span><span>  serve  it.</span><span>  His  connection  with  the  firm  of</span><span>  Towns  and  Co.  ceased,  and  bis  consti</span><span>  tuency  thereon  found  that  he  was  not</span><span>  what  they  had  thought  him.  He,  with</span><span>  equal  reason,  returned  their  contempt.</span><span>  He  cared  nought  for  meetings,  leading</span><span>  articles,  lemonstrances,  or  deputations.</span><span>  Whether  they  understood  him  or  not  he</span><span>  thorougly  appreciated  them,  and  in</span><span>  silent  dignity  maintained  his  scat.</span><span>  With  easy  grace  he  lolled  on  his  soft</span><span>  cushion  —  now  looking  reverently  as</span><span>  fluent  tactics  trickled  from  the  tongue</span><span>  of  Herbert  —  now  rapt  in  ecstasy  at</span><span>  the  declamatory  satire  of  Macalister</span><span>  —  now  bent  in  profound  assent</span><span>  to  the  legal  lore  of  Prikg  —  now  pon</span><span>  dering  over  the  lumbering  statistics</span><span>  of  Mopfatt.  Whether  he  understood</span><span>  either  was  of  little  consequent.  His</span><span>  vote  was  to  the  point,  and  unreasoning</span><span>  fidelity  being  a  praiseworthy  attribute</span><span>  of  the  lower  species  of  animals,  he  fur</span><span>  nished  no  exception.  So  in  due  time</span><span>  his  revard  came.  In  the  last  general</span><span>  election  his  voice  was  not  heard.  In</span><span>  serene  silence  he  sat  and  counted  his</span><span>  gains.

Some  are</span><span>  disguised  under  a  thin  covering  of  ce</span><span>  ment,  and  assume  the  aspect  of  an  orna</span><span>  mental  stone  front,  until  a  glance  round</span><span>  the  comer  discloses  the  weather-boards,</span><span>  whioh  there  it  was  not  thought  neces</span><span>  sary  to  hide.  Sometimes  the  mould</span><span>  ings,  projections,  and  decorations  which</span><span>  are  applicable  in  substantial  structures</span><span>  are  imitated  in  wood  with  as  much</span><span>  success  as  bad  material,  worse  taste,  and</span><span>  indifferent  execution  will  admit.  But,</span><span>  go  where  you  will,  what  with  building</span><span>  societies  and  licensed  surveyors,  we  are</span><span>  accumulating  facilities  for  the  creation</span><span>  of  a  congeries  of  huddled-np  lath  and</span></p> <p><span>  plaster  edifices,  admirably  fitted  for  the</span><span>  generation  of  as  much  discomfort  and</span><span>  disease  as  either  doctor  or  undertaker</span><span>  could  desire.  And  this  we  dignify  by</span><span>  the  name  of  a  city  —  the  metropolis  of</span><span>  the  colony  —  the  largest  assemblage  of</span><span>  rickety  houses  within  its  boundary.</span><span>  When  the  City  of  Brisbane  was  first</span><span>  founded,  and  long  after,  it  did  not  mat</span><span>  ter  of  what  material  a  man's  dwelling</span><span>  was  built  —  that  is  as  respects  the  pub</span><span>  lic  interest;  but  within  the  last  three</span><span>  years  the  crowding  of  houses  in  our</span><span>  streets  has  been  such  that  the  public</span><span>  have  a  right  to  some  voice  in  control</span><span>  ing  the  rights  and  proceedings  of  indi</span><span>  viduals.  A  wooden  house  in  Queen</span><span>  street  is  a  dangerous  nuisance  —  a  con</span><span>  tinuous  row  of  wooden  houses  is  still</span><span>  more  dangerous.  It  is  not  easy  to  con</span><span>  ceive  the  loss  of  life  and  property  that</span><span>  might  occur  were  half  a-dozen  of  these</span><span>  gingerbread  constructions  exposed  to</span><span>  the  danger  of  a  fire  such  as  in  other</span><span>  Australian  towns  has  produced  sjnub^</span><span>  isemk  yjinn  yjgmtii  ,i  I  )~\mKm</span><span>  MMN@^5t5f3^fiwae%bbSm^jf</span><span>  such  risks,  and  if  the  law  as  it  stands]'</span><span>  is  powedesss  to  protect  them,  it  becomes  I</span><span>  indispensable  to  amend  and  enlarge  its  1</span><span>  operations.  We  want  a  good  Building  I</span><span>  Act,  and  with  it  one  for  securing  I</span><span>  facilities  Car  sooner  or  later  carrying  I</span><span>  out  an  efficient  system  of  sewerage.  The]</span><span>  first  is  perhaps  the  most  immediately  I</span><span>  important.  1</span><span>  That  it  would  require  agooddealofj</span><span>  care,  of  judgment,  and  of  professional  I</span><span>  experience,  as  well  as  no  small  share  of</span><span>  firmness,  to  frame  a  really  useful  Build</span><span>  ing  Act,  we  do  not  doubt;  but  that  ib</span><span>  no  reason  why  the  trial  should  sot  be</span><span>  made.  In  dealing  with  the  rights  of</span><span>  property,  it  is  always  distasteful  to  the</span><span>  owners  to  compel  their  remembrance</span><span>  and  performance  of  its  duties,  and  there</span><span>  is  nothing  in  the  peculiar  character  of</span><span>  town  property  to  withdraw  it  from  such</span><span>  a  condition.  It  may  appear  hard  to  tell</span><span>  8  .man  that  he  shall  divide  bis  building</span><span>  from  hie  neighbours  by  a  stout  parting</span><span>  wall,  carried  sufficiently  high  to  prevent</span><span>  the  chance  of  fire  communicating  to</span><span>  adjoining  houses  ;  but  it  isstill  neces</span><span>  sary  for  the  protection  of  those  neigh</span><span>  bours  that  this  should  be  done.  It  may</span><span>  appear  still  more  arbitrary  to  say  that</span><span>  none  of  his  rooms  fah&Q  be  less  than  a</span><span>  certain  height,  bat  considerations  of</span><span>  public  health,  in  which,  is  included  his</span><span>  own,  enforce  the  propriety  of  such  a</span><span>  provision.  It  may  be  a  sore  annoyance</span><span>  to  a  speculator  to  be  told  that  a  certain</span><span>  amount  of  unoccupied  space  shall  be</span><span>  left  in  the  rear  of  every  building,  and</span><span>  that  no  floor  shall  be  lower  than  a  cer</span><span>  tain  depth  below  the  general  street  line  ;</span><span>  bnt  if  we  are  to  secure  efficient  drainage</span><span>  and  a  fit  atmosphere,  this  trill  have</span><span>  to  be  done.  There  is,  probably,  no</span><span>  place  on  earth  where  men  are  more</span><span>  jealous  wf  individual  rights  than  the</span><span>  City  of  London.  Yet  there  it  has  been</span><span>  found  necessary  to  enact  all  those  pro</span><span>  visions,  and  others,  apparently,  &r</span><span>  more  stringent.  The  necessity  acknow</span><span>  ledged,  action  followed,  and  the  neaUh</span><span>  of  that  vast  population  lias  benefited</span><span>  accordingly.  We  .must  never  forget</span><span>  that  in  this  climate  it  is  quite</span><span>  possible,  with  a  small  population,  to</span><span>  incur  all  lbs  dangers  which  in  the  much</span><span>  colder  one  of  England  a  vast  city  has</span><span>  been  at  such  expense  and  trouble  to</span><span>  guard  against-  We  have  only  to  crowd</span><span>  as  we  are  crowding,  and  build  as  we  are</span><span>  building,  to  ensure  on  a  small  scale</span><span>  either  plague  or  fire  on  a  ecale</span><span>  that  would  satisfy  the  most  exag</span></p> <p><span>  gerated  a1armiBt,and  it  is  time  that  some</span><span>  preventive  measures  be  adopted  in  both</span><span>  cases.</span><span>  In  Hie  Imperial  Parliament  the  great</span><span>  questions  involved  by  the  Building  and</span><span>  Drainage  Acts  were  dealt  with  by.tbe</span><span>  Government  of  the  day;  and,  indeed,</span><span>  successive  goYeraments  deserved  oo</span></p> <p><span>  small  credit  forkhe  care  and  skill  de</span><span>  voted  to  Jthe  several  enactments  that</span><span>  were  from  time  Jo  time  found  necessary.</span><span>  Here  we  confess'to  a  doubt  whether  we</span><span>  had  not  better  almost  remain  as  we  are</span><span>  than  meet  the  consequences  of  the  ave</span><span>  rage  tinkering  which  in  our  Legislature</span><span>  distinguishes  most  of  the  Government</span><span>  law-making.

Mr.  St.</span><span>  George  Gobe  —  e  beg  his  pardon  —  the</span><span>  honorable  St.  G  -rge  Gore  —  looks  wise</span><span>  enough  to  conw  I  some'  sense  under  his</span><span>  solemn  guise.  1  r.

If  no</span><span>  more  can  be  done,  perhaps  Mr.  Brah</span><span>  stoN  will  again  pore  among  the  English</span><span>  Acts,  and  set  tie  genius  of  a  copying</span><span>  clerk  to  work  in  *ure  love  of  legislation</span><span>  for  the  colony  If  Queensland.  If  he</span><span>  will  only  forego  any  attempt  at  origin</span><span>  ality,  we  might  be  able  to  afford  even</span><span>  him  some  quaMed  kind  of  support,</span><span>  although  such  i  possibility  is  within</span><span>  the  limits  of  hojje  rattier  than  expecta</span><span>  tion.</span><span>  *  a-</span></p> <p><span>  On  several  occasions  it  has  been  the</span><span>  duty  of  this  jolirnal  to  point  out  in</span><span>  terms  more  plait*  perhaps  than  pleasant,</span><span>  the  baneful  effects  of  a  large  squatto</span><span>  cratic  influence  en  the  legislation  of  the</span><span>  country.  In  every  instance,  however,</span><span>  we  have  endeavored  to  guard  our</span><span>  readers  from  including  the  entire  class</span><span>  in  the  censure  earned  by  a  number  of</span><span>  its  more  prominent  members.  It  is</span><span>  necessary  to  tb.3  well-being  and  pro</span><span>  gress  of  the  colony  that  this  distinction</span><span>  should  be  clearly  understood,  and  we</span><span>  think  the  present  juncture  more  oppor</span><span>  tune  for  its  calm  consideration,  than</span><span>  any  which  would  be  presented  in  circum</span><span>  stances  where,  of.  necessity,  it  would  be</span><span>  mixed  np  with  or  affected  by  the  com</span><span>  plexion  of  othev  questions  on  which  a</span><span>  difference  of  public  opinion  existed.</span><span>  To  the  squaler,  as  the  pioneer  of</span><span>  colonization,  society  is  greatly  indebted,</span><span>  from  his  industry  proceed  the  first</span><span>  exports  of  ''the  country,  and  his  wants</span><span>  I  provide  the  laborer  with  employment</span><span>  [and  the*  tradesman  with  castam  &r  JiJ</span><span>  tbe  squatter  explores  and  opens  up  the</span><span>  country;  his  secsssities  make  Mm  the</span><span>  discoverer  of  theqiostconvenient  lines  of</span><span>  road  and  of  the  best  sites  for  townships  ;</span><span>  while  he  withstands  and  subdues  the</span><span>  barbarous  aborigines  in  their  first  con</span><span>  tact  with  civilization,  risking  alike  his</span><span>  life  and  bis  capital  in  the  venture.</span><span>  In  each  of  thejforegoing  respects  his</span><span>  value  to  the  cdamunity  is  fully  ad</span><span>  mitted  and.appreciated  by  every  reason</span><span>  able  colonist,  an£  society  grants  him</span><span>  privileges  to  conjpensate  for  his  exer</span><span>  tions  and  his  risks,  the  like  of</span><span>  which  are  unkjiown  in  any  other</span><span>  pursuit.

It  is  not  the  full  enjoyment</span><span>  of  these  advantages  which  induce  other</span><span>  sections  of  colonists  to  distrust  the</span><span>  squatter,  or  find  fault  with  the  politi</span><span>  cal  power  which  a  portion  of  that  class</span><span>  through  their  social  position  have  ma</span><span>  naged  to  get  conferred  on  themselves,</span><span>  to  the  detriment  of  all  other  sections,</span><span>  as  well  as  tbe  less  favoured  of  their  own.</span><span>  The  true  cause  Jbr  that  distrust,  and</span><span>  the  political  antagonism  they  have</span><span>  created,  is  to  be,  found  in  the  selfish</span><span>  ness  and  ohstractivenesB  they  invariably</span><span>  display  in  their  electoral  or  legislative</span><span>  capacity,  and  in  the  irritating  tone  in</span><span>  which  they  claim  for  themselves,</span><span>  the  entire  merit  of  the  prosperity  of  the</span><span>  country,  and  five  uncontrolled  authority</span><span>  to  do  as  they  please  with  its  lands  and</span><span>  its  Government.</span><span>  The  arrogant  assumption  of  some  of</span><span>  these  men  is  most  hurtful  to  the  class</span><span>  to  which  they  belong.

Their  utter  sel</span><span>  fishness  has  become  so  barefaced  that  it</span><span>  can  be  no  longer  masked  :  their  trade</span><span>  in  land  orders,  their  illegal  purchase  of</span><span>  Agricultural  Reserves  where  the  land</span><span>  chanced  to  be  good,  the  sale  of  (heir</span><span>  votes  for  a  bonus  in  land  already  re</span><span>  served  for  public  purpoees,  their  inte</span><span>  rested  support  of  a  railway  to  give</span><span>  value  to  their  pre-emptive  rights,  and</span><span>  their  antiquated  and  unfair  assessment</span><span>  which  deprives  the  revenue  of  tens  of</span><span>  thousands  of  pounds  to  which  it  would</span></p> <p><span>  be  entitled  were  they  placed  on  a  simi</span><span>  lar  footing  to  their  brother  squatters  in</span><span>  the  outside  districts,  are  all  evidences</span><span>  of  a  selfishness  which  unfits  them  for</span><span>  the  exercise  of  large  influence</span><span>  or  political  power.  It  is  fortunate,</span><span>  however,  that  the  real  squatters  have  at</span><span>  length  begun  to  see  through  the  charac</span><span>  ter  of  the  Moreton  and  Darling  Downs</span><span>  nabobs,  and  to  feel  how  humbling  it  is</span><span>  to  be  coanected  with  them,  or  to  be</span><span>  EmgEgQSS5BKSfcHavmsnPwgiaitfpTOr-™fDelt'</span><span>  lands  made  to  pay  more  for  distant  and</span><span>  inferior  country  than  the  others  do  for</span><span>  the  choicest  of  the  lands  of  the  colony.</span><span>  Heretofore,  when  dealing  with  political</span><span>  subjects  and  speaking  of  the  squatters</span><span>  as  a  class,  the  references  we  have  made</span><span>  have  been  solely  to  the  squatters  of  the</span><span>  settled  districts.  Unfortunately  under</span><span>  our  present  system  of  representation</span><span>  the  real  pioneer  squatters  in  the  out</span><span>  districts  have  had  little  or  no  voice  in</span><span>  the  Government  of  the  country  ;  and</span><span>  owing  to  the  wealth  and  specionsness</span><span>  of  the  Darling  Downs  gentry,  they  or</span><span>  their  tools  have  managed  to  monopolise</span><span>  the  little  which  they  had.  But  a  time</span><span>  is  approaching  when  if  the  Equatters  of</span><span>  the  out  districts  are  true  to  themselves</span><span>  and  to  the  colonv.  thev  can  free  them</span></p> <p><span>  selves  and  their  class  from  the  odium</span><span>  that  attaches  to  the  cormorant  section</span><span>  who  have  sullied  their  common  designa</span><span>  tion.  For  their  own  welfare  sake,  and</span><span>  for  tbe  prosperity  of  the  colony,  they</span><span>  should  do  eo  ;  they  should  select  repre</span><span>  sentatives  from  among  themselves  who</span><span>  would  urge  the  wants  of  their  districts,</span><span>  and  support  every  measure  that  would</span><span>  tend  to  the  peopling  and  development</span><span>  of  the  country,  as  the  safest  aud  most</span><span>  honourable  means  by  which  to  ensure</span><span>  their  own  success  and  their  good  name</span><span>  amongst  the  community.</span><span>  On  the  real  squatter  every  intelligent</span><span>  colonist  will  look  with  favour,  for  the</span><span>  reasons  we  have  already  assigned.

It  may  well  surprise</span><span>  those  who,  taking  an  interest  in  the</span><span>  events  passing  in  the  northern  portion</span><span>  of  the  American  continent,  anticipated</span><span>  therefrom  an  issue  in  flccordaace  with</span><span>  the  usual  relations  between  cause  and</span><span>  effect  in  such  circumstances.  That  die</span><span>  presence  of  the  French  in  Mexico</span><span>  would  result  in  the  establishment  there</span><span>  of  a  strong  government  of  some  form</span><span>  was  certainly  foreseen  by  many,  but</span><span>  that  the  reduction  of  the  country  would</span><span>  have  been  so  speedily  effected  as  to</span><span>  permit  of  the  consolidation  of  an  cm</span><span>  pireof  French  manufacture  in  the  realms</span><span>  of  the  Artec  so  soon,  could  have  been</span><span>  hardly  looked  for.  The  French  have  had</span><span>  to  overcome  the  most  desperate  resist</span><span>  ance  at  every  step  ;  the  taking  of</span><span>  Puebla  was  for  a  long  time  problemati</span><span>  cal  ;  and  the  City  of  Mexico,  according</span><span>  to  accounts  by  the  last  mail,  was  in</span><span>  every  way  prepared  to  sustain  a  long</span><span>  siege.  But  if  the  telegram  be  correct,</span><span>  Marshal  Fobet  has  accomplished  hiB</span><span>  mission.  Not  only,  however,  have  the</span><span>  French  triumphed  in  the  field.  They</span><span>  have  succeeded  in  establishing  an</span><span>  empire  in  the  country  —  a  fact  which</span><span>  wiU  hereafter  redound  more  to  the</span><span>  credit  of  the  Cabinet  of  the  Tuileries</span><span>  than  the  triumph  of  its  army.  Maxi</span><span>  xnjAN,  a  member  of  the  royal  family</span><span>  of  Austria,  is  to  preside  over  the  desti</span><span>  nies  of  the  new  Empire.  Certainly</span><span>  it  would  be  hard  to  make  ajoelection</span><span>  likely  to  give  more  satisfaction  to  the</span><span>  Powers  that  are  now  interested  is  the</span><span>  affairs  of  Mexico,  viz.,  England,  Fiance,</span><span>  and  Spain.

"<p><span>  i%  g|fov%  5|us;tfaUau.</span><span>  THURSDAY,  OCTOBER  1.  1S63.</span></p> <p><span>  As  the  presence  of  life  in  the  human</span><span>  body  is  evinced  by  the  activity  and</span><span>  motion  of  its  several  parts  and  members,</span><span>  so  the  most  decidpd  evidence  of  consti</span><span>  tutional  life  is  thut  peculiar  movement</span><span>  inseparable  from  '  its  nature  —  political</span><span>  agitation.  It  is  by  a  misconception  of</span><span>  its  real  character  that  the  action  of</span><span>  Constitutional  Government  is  ordinaril  v</span></p> <p><span>  supposed  to  be  limited  to  the  workings</span><span>  of  the  Legislative  body.  Constitutional</span><span>  Government  has  a  much  wider  sphere</span><span>  of  action,  embracing  the  entire  move</span><span>  ment  of  the  Body  politic.</span><span>  In  Absolute  Governments  the  Body</span><span>  politic  is  reduced  to  the  condition  of  a</span><span>  machine,  which  cj-eys,  by  a  movement</span><span>  extraneous  to  and  independent  of  its</span><span>  own  will,  the  impulse  that  is  given  to</span><span>  it  by  a  motive  power  over  which  it  has</span><span>  no  control  whatsoever.  Such  mechan</span><span>  ical  action,  however  admirably  planned</span><span>  and  conducted,  is  degrading  to  the  in</span><span>  dividualities  that  constitute  the  whole,</span><span>  and  hence  no  Absolute  Government  yet</span><span>  devised  has  ever  completely  or  durably</span><span>  satisfied  the  Body  politic  to  which  it</span><span>  was  applied.  It  is  owing  to  this  defici</span><span>  ency  that  Absolute  has  given  place  to</span><span>  Constitutional  Government,  wherever</span><span>  the  sentiment  ofi  individual  independ</span><span>  ence  has  been  Correctly  understood.</span><span>  But  were  thi6  sentiment  of  individual</span><span>  in&ependeoaa  to  «**  ?*—J«rF-iJ  with  .</span><span>  simply  deputing  tbe  direction  of  the</span><span>  Body  politic  to  (  a  few  chosen  in</span><span>  dividuals,  without,  in  any  wise,</span><span>  controlling  their  action,  it  is  plain  that</span><span>  such  a  form  of  government  could  no</span><span>  longer  correctly  be  termed  Consti</span><span>  tutional,  but  would  appropriately  be</span><span>  styled  Oligarchic.  So  tbat,  in  order  to</span><span>  arrive  at  the  true  ideal  of  Constitu</span><span>  tional  Government,  it  is  not  sufficient</span><span>  for,the  individuals  constituting  the  Body</span><span>  politic  to  appoint  deputies  to  superin</span><span>  tend  its  workings,  but  it  is  tbe  duty  of</span><span>  each  individual,  according  to  his</span><span>  capacity,  to  exercise  a  supervision  over</span><span>  the  action  of  the  deputies  so  appointed.</span><span>  In  this  consists  the  admirable  harmony</span><span>  arising  out  of  the  mutual  dependence</span><span>  that  characterises  Constitutional  union.</span><span>  This  perfect  conception  of  Constitutional</span><span>  Government  has,  it  may  be  'said,  been</span><span>  only  obtained  in  Great  Britain.  There,</span><span>  the  free  expression  of  public  opinion,</span><span>  upon  matters  concerning  the  workings</span><span>  of  the  Body  politic,  has  been  deemed  in</span><span>  separable  from  and  essential  to  Consti</span><span>  tutional  Government.  Hence  the  free</span><span>  dom  of  the  Press,  and  the  right  of  hold</span><span>  ing  public  meetings  have  been  pro</span><span>  claimed  by  the  Constitution  to  be  the</span><span>  indisputable  and  sovereign  prerogatives</span><span>  of  the  people.  Other  countries,  in</span><span>  deed,  have  in  modern  times  essayed  to</span><span>  establish  a  mongrel  sort  of  Constitu</span><span>  tional  Government,  their  sovereigns'</span><span>  autocratic  tendencies  leading  them</span><span>  to  suppose  that  they  did  enough  for  the</span><span>  people's  liberties  by  instituting  servile</span><span>  Upper  and  Lower  Houses  of  Parlia</span><span>  ment,  at  the  same  time  that  they</span><span>  wholly  or  partially  gagged  die  Press,</span><span>  and  refused  to  the  people  the  right  of</span><span>  political  assemblage.  But  invariably</span><span>  such  a  system  has  failed.  A  striking</span><span>  instance  of  this  we  find  in  tbe  unfbr-  -?</span><span>  -tmnate  imus  xrf  Louis  Philippe's  Con</span><span>  stitutionalism.  Under  that  sovereign</span><span>  with  representative  government,  tbe</span><span>  Press  was  gagged,  political  meetings</span><span>  were  not  freely  allowed,  and  the  conse</span><span>  quence  was,  that  the  refusal  to  permit</span><span>  a  political  dinner  overthrew  simul</span><span>  taneously  the  so-called  Constitution</span><span>  and  the  reigning  dynasty.  So  essential</span><span>  to  Constitutional  Government  arc  these</span><span>  two  great  privileges  of  the  people.</span><span>  Our  Colonial  Constitutional  life  is  of</span><span>  so  recent  a  date,  the  population  is  so  '</span><span>  sparingly  disseminated  over  a  vast</span><span>  territorial  sur&ce,  and  the  questions</span><span>  that  liave  Mtfaetto  divided  the  public</span><span>  mind  have  been  'eUb.er  bo  unimportant</span><span>  in  themselves  or  so  lightly  viewed  by</span><span>  ?the  people,  that  up  to  the  present  no</span><span>  great  political  agitation  lias  marked  our</span><span>  Constitutional  career.  But  latterly,</span><span>  measures  very  obnoxious  to  large  sec</span><span>  tions  of  the  community  have  been  in</span><span>  Tested  with  tbe  force  of  law.  This  fact</span><span>  must  not  surprise;  it.  is  a  necessary</span><span>  feature  of  Constitutional  Govern</span><span>  ment.  Differences  of  opinion  must</span><span>  prevail,  bat  eventually  reasonably</span><span>  founded  claims  must  also  prevail.  The</span><span>  time  uow  seems  to  have  arrived  when</span><span>  the  exercise  of  the  people's  prerogative</span><span>  is  become  absolutely  necessary.  One</span><span>  sided,  partial  lans  have  been  enacted^</span><span>  indirect  aggressioii  bos  been  made  upon</span><span>  liberty  of  conscience;  national  distinc</span><span>  tions  htm  bees  upheld  tolhe  exclusion</span></p> <p><span>  of  useful  colonists;  land-laws  have</span><span>  been  framed  in  fiivor  of  a  class  to  the</span><span>  detriment  of  the  community  at  large  ;</span><span>  glaring  abuses  and  corruption  have</span><span>  crept  into  the  distribution  of  the</span><span>  revenue,  and  adequate  popular  repre</span><span>  tion  has  been  withheld.  It  is  true,  the</span><span>  existence  of  these  very  grievances  de</span><span>  monstrates  the  necessary  connection</span><span>  between  right  Constitutional  Govern</span><span>  ment  and  political  agitation;  because,</span><span>  it  being  admitted  that  grievances  are  in</span><span>  separable  from  Constitutional  Govern</span><span>  ment,\heir  remedy,  when  they  are  rea</span><span>  sonably  grounded,  is  always  to  be  found</span><span>  in  popular  agitation,  Wherefore,  then,</span><span>  do  not  those  different  sections  of  the</span><span>  community  who  consider  in  the  light</span></p> <p><span>  of  grievances*  the  laws  now  in  force</span><span>  with  reference  to  Education,  to  Immi</span><span>  gration,  to  Land,  to  Representation,  and</span><span>  to  Suffrage,  have  recourse  to  political</span><span>  agitation,  and  hold  public  meetings  to</span><span>  give  expression  to  their  sentiments  upon</span><span>  all  these  questions  ?  This  is  the  true</span><span>  constitutional  course  to  follow.  This  is</span><span>  to  exercise  becomingly  the  prerogative</span><span>  of  the  people.</span><span>  We*  observe  with  satisfaction</span><span>  that  tn|s  course  has  been  recently</span><span>  wick^ithTeterence  toaraylmporSK</span><span>  queation.  We  cannot  too  highly  admire,</span><span>  this  right  appreciation  and  due  exercise,</span><span>  on  the  part  of  the  people  of  Warwick,</span><span>  of  the  people's  prerogative.  We  feel</span><span>  convinced  that  their  constitutional  ac</span><span>  tion  must  eventually  lead,  if  duly  sus</span><span>  tained,  to  satisfactory  results.  And  we</span><span>  feel  that  we  cannot  do  better  than  to</span><span>  invite  all  those  other  sections  of  the</span><span>  community,  who  deem  that  they  are</span><span>  aggrieved  in  their  rights  and  liberties</span><span>  by  the  present  govermcntal  policy,  to</span><span>  imitate  the  .  spirited  and  eminently</span><span>  constitutional  procedure  of  the  inhabi</span><span>  tants  of  Warwick.  While  on  our  part</span><span>  we  pledge  ourselves  that  the  free  ex</span><span>  pression  of  opinion  through  the  medium</span><span>  of  the  Press  —  shall  not,  in  our  instance,</span><span>  I'e  an  idle  and  useless  privilege  of  Con</span></p> <p><span>  stitutional  Government.</span><span>  ♦?  ?</span><span>  We  are  not  quite  sure  tbat  there  is</span><span>  anything  in  the  shape  of  political</span><span>  morality  in  this  colony  of  Queensland.</span><span>  At  any  rate,  if  there  is,  its  public</span><span>  manifestation  is  exceedingly  rare.  And</span><span>  from  its  almost  entire  absence  has</span><span>  arisen  those  otherwise  inexplicable</span><span>  changes  by  constituencies,  and  equally</span><span>  inexplicable  inconsistencies  by  repre</span><span>  sentatives,  which  are  causes  of  wonder</span><span>  ment  to  our  neighbours,  and  in  some</span><span>  respects  even  to  ourselves.  That  such</span><span>  a  degraded  condition  of  public  feeling</span><span>  must  surely,  although  graduaily,operate</span><span>  very  largely  to  the  prejudice  of  tbe</span><span>  colony,  we  cannot  doubt.  If  credit  be</span><span>  the  fruit  of  honesty,  and  the  honesty  be</span><span>  absent,  one  can  expect  nothing  else  than</span><span>  that  credit  will  in  due  time  be  absent</span><span>  also.  It  matters  little  whether  this</span><span>  absence  arises  from  the  incapacity  of</span><span>  public  meu  to  see  where  political  dis</span><span>  jK»Mtijr.iajgins.  orirom  their  total  in</span><span>  sensibility  to  all  considerations  of  the</span><span>  kind,  although  of  the  two  evils  the</span><span>  former  is  the  worst,  as  least  possible  to</span><span>  guard  against.  But  in  either  case  the</span><span>  apparent  or  real  want  of  principle</span><span>  must  tend  to  sap  our  credit,</span><span>  and  with  it  our  prosperity.</span><span>  RetrogradatioB,  carried  by  such  courses,</span><span>  is  not  easily  arrested,  for  with  a  people</span><span>  as  with  an  individual,  a  reputation  lost</span><span>  by  a  continuous  career  of  inattention  to</span><span>  common  honesty,  is  not  to  be  retrieved</span><span>  by  one  or  two  isolated  acts  of  benevo</span><span>  lence  or  fairness.</span><span>  W«  have  bad  some  very  singular</span><span>  manifestations  of  this  kind  of  feeling</span><span>  during  the  last  session,  and  tbe  elections</span><span>  which  preceded  and  accompanied  it.</span><span>  One  point  strongly  insisted  upon  as  of</span><span>  great  importance  upon  all  sides,  was  the</span><span>  relative  positions  of  the  Government</span><span>  and  the  Queensland  Immigration  So</span><span>  ciety  consequent  upon  the  action  of  Mr.</span><span>  HsbbibT;  bat  this  relation  was</span><span>  scarcely,  if  at  all,  canvassed  by  our</span><span>  leading  politicians,  with  respect  to  the</span><span>  real  political  bearing  of  that  action,  or</span><span>  its  conformity  to  or  violation  of  the</span><span>  fundamental  roles  of  the  constitution.</span><span>  On  one  side  it  was  indeed  contended</span><span>  that  the  operations  of  tbe  Society  were</span><span>  objectionable,  and  tbat  in  Buch  case  tbe</span><span>  Ministry  were  right  in  interferingto  stop</span><span>  them.  Why  they  were  objectionable,</span><span>  or  on  what  grounds  was  set  forth  only</span><span>  by  one  or  two  of  the  loudest  advocates</span><span>  of  the  party,  and  they  were  merely</span><span>  based  on  the  fact,  that  tbe  promoters  of</span><span>  the  Society  were  Catholics  and  Irish</span><span>  men,  and  the  bulk  of  those  benefited</span><span>  by  its  movements  would  be  of  the  same</span><span>  creed  and  nation.  If,  therefore,  that</span><span>  objection  were  valid  in  any  shape  it</span><span>  must  necessarily  follow,  that  the  pro</span><span>  scription  of  the  particular  creed  and</span><span>  nation  is  paHruf  the  -duty  of  -»  rehinwt</span><span>  minister.  That  in  its  fullest  extent  few</span><span>  were  bold  enough  to  avow,  although</span><span>  some  ultra-members  of  tbe  opposition</span><span>  even,  found  religious  reasons  to  justify</span><span>  such  an  extreme  opinion.  But  tbe</span><span>  most  important  enquiry  of  all  —  whether,</span><span>  when  laws  have  been  solemnly  enacted,</span><span>  it  is  consistent  with  constitutional  prin</span><span>  ciples  that  those  laws  should  be  sus</span><span>  pended  by  the  action  ofMSS  Executive</span><span>  upon  its  own  mere  motion  —  was  altoge</span><span>  ther  lost  sight  of  by  the  great  majority</span><span>  of  our  public  men  f  That  concurrence</span><span>  in  any  such  a  course  was,  in  feet,  declar</span><span>  ing  the  power  and  decree  of  Parliament</span><span>  :£abject  to  tbe  revision  and  alteration  of</span><span>  the  ministers  of  the  day,  and  was  there</span><span>  fore  most  dangerous  to  the  liberty  of</span><span>  tbe  subject  and  tbe  safety  of  tbe  colony,</span><span>  seems  to  have  been  fotgotten  or  un</span><span>  heeded.  Tbe  opposition,  moved  by</span><span>  questionable  and  jealous  motives,  bad</span><span>  not  courage  or  ability  to  close  with  die</span><span>  real  difficulty  of  die  position.  To  some</span><span>  men  the  name  and  office  of  a  Bishop  is</span><span>  an  abomination.

They  thus</span><span>  escaped  from  a  betrayal  of  ignorance  as</span><span>  to  the  real  nature  of  their  own  func</span><span>  tions  as  well  as  from  an  exhibition  of</span><span>  intolerance,  which,  although  consistent</span><span>  with  their  character  and  ideas,  would</span><span>  hardly  have  been  so  with  the  great  body</span><span>  of  public  opinion.</span><span>  The  fact  that  the  promoters  of</span><span>  the  Queensland  Immigration  Society</span><span>  had  acted  in  strict  conformity  with  law,</span><span>  and  had  only  shown  superior</span><span>  skill  and  energy  in  rendering  its  pro</span><span>  visionseffective  was  entirely  ignored  and</span><span>  evaded,  because  hon.  members  had  a</span></p> <p><span>  suspicion  that  the  law  itself  was  more  libe</span><span>  ral  than  its  first  {ranters  intended  or</span><span>  supposed  it  to  be.  But  if  the  law  were</span><span>  defective,  why  not  alter  it  1  This  all</span><span>  parties  were  ashamed  and  afraid  to</span><span>  openly  attempt.  They  dared  not  pro</span><span>  pose  to  pass  a  retrospective  statute  de</span><span>  claring  the  land  law  of  1861</span><span>  inefficient,  and  the  conduct  of</span><span>  parties  acting  under  it  illegal.  That</span><span>  would  have  been  met  with  disallowance</span><span>  at  home,  no  matter  what  party  had</span><span>  been  in  power  ;  for  the  Imperial</span><span>  tooonsiter  an  executive  as  beyond'  or</span><span>  superior  to  &  legislature,  or  to  indulge</span><span>  in  a  penal  ex  post  facto  legislation  them</span><span>  selves,  or  to  sanction  it  in  others.  But</span><span>  the  correct  procedure  was  sub</span><span>  stituted  by  an  untruthful  reso</span><span>  lution  declaring  Parliament  to  have</span><span>  lessened  tbe  value  of  the  kind  order,</span><span>  although  the  Government  itself  bad</span><span>  ordered  the  change  on  its  own  sole  re</span><span>  sponsibility,  but  rather  than  contend</span><span>  for  a  disagreeable  truth,  the  reso</span><span>  lution  was  agreed  to  ;  and  the</span><span>  records  of  the  Queensland  Legisla</span><span>  ture  were  disgraced  by  as  gross  a  false</span><span>  hood  as  was  ever  perpetrated  by  any</span><span>  body  of  men,  however  ignorant,  stupid,</span><span>  or  corrupt.  Tbe  falsehood  will  go</span><span>  borne  to  exculpate  the  Ministry,  and  to</span><span>  implicate  the  Assembly.  Time  will</span><span>  assuredly  disclose  its  mendacity,  and</span><span>  the  whole  colony  will  be  associated  with</span><span>  a  glaring  disgrace.  Had  two  or  three</span><span>  members  of  dissenting  bodies  been</span><span>  dealt  with  in  like  manner  as  the</span><span>  Queensland  Immigration  Society,</span><span>  certain  loud  speakers  and  writers  would</span><span>  have  made  the  welkin  resound  with</span><span>  tbeir  declamations  on  the  liberty  of  the</span><span>  subject,  the  honor  of  Parliament,  and</span><span>  the  fundamental  principles  of  the  con</span><span>  stitution.  They  were  silent  enough  —</span><span>  temperate  enough  if  it  so  please  them  —</span><span>  and  the  silence  must,  for  the  reasons</span><span>  we  have  adduced,  be  taken  as  that  of</span><span>  either  ignorance  or  consent,  and  be</span><span>  dealt  with  accordingly.</span><span>  Not  the  least  discreditable  circum</span><span>  stance  to  the  knowledge  or  honesty  of</span><span>  Parliament  and  of  the  Government  is</span><span>  the  present  Btate  of  the  Immigration</span><span>  question.  The  Act  of  1861  stands  nn</span><span>  repealed,  except  where  altered  by  tbe</span><span>  Agricultural  Reserves'  Act.  As  re</span><span>  spects  Immigration,  tbe  resolutions  of</span><span>  ti»  ixMuU;  Wlone^—  or  iie  adoption</span><span>  of  a  report  from  one  of  its  own  Com</span><span>  mittees  is  worth  nothing  ;  and  action</span><span>  taken  upon  bo  slender  and  partial  a</span><span>  basis  will  be  illegal.  What  Parliament</span><span>  as  a  whole  have  done,  Parliament  as  a</span><span>  whole  alone  can  alter.  Dispense  with</span><span>  this  rule,  and  the  whole  basis  of  our</span><span>  laws  and  rights  are  overturned.  We</span><span>  are  no  longer  protected  by  our  own</span><span>  power  of  action  upon  the  Legislature,</span><span>  and  representation  is  a  farce,  —  worse</span><span>  than  a  farce  —  a  mischievous  and  dan</span><span>  gerous  delusion.  Yet,  as  matters  now</span><span>  stand,  the  contrary  theory  is  insisted</span><span>  upon  by  Government,  and  practically</span><span>  acquiesced  in  by  the  great  bulk  of  the</span><span>  Opposition.  What  proof  have  we  that</span><span>  the  applicability  of  this  convenient</span><span>  system  to  other  subjects  may  not  be</span><span>  enforced  by  the  existence  pf  this  very</span><span>  precedent  ;  and,  if  so,  who  will  be  to</span><span>  blame  f  Supposing  the  members  of</span><span>  tbe  Assembly  to  know  anything  of  Con</span><span>  stitutional  Law,  can  it  be  denied  that</span><span>  they  trouble  themselves  very  little  with</span><span>  political  morality?</span><span>  The  question  of  an  enlarged  aud</span><span>  equitable  re-distribution  of  Parliamen</span><span>  tary  Representation  should  henceforth</span><span>  receive  a  large  share  of  pnblic  attention.</span><span>  An  Act  to  authorise  tbe  making  of  a</span><span>  Census  early  in  the  coming  year  has</span><span>  passed  the  Legislature  ;  and  in  the  vice</span><span>  regal  speech  at  the  prorogation  of  the</span><span>  last  session  of  Parliament  the  subject  is</span><span>  alluded  to  in  a  marked  manner,  aB  one</span><span>  of  tbe  measures  about  to  receive  tbe</span><span>  attention  of  tbe  Executive  during  the</span><span>  present  recess.  To  die  early  considera</span><span>  tion  devoted  by  the  several  constituen</span><span>  cies  to  the  question  and  its  details,  will</span><span>  any  w4M»rr'»  «-f  p»rH»m«m*.«ry  fieform</span><span>  be  chiefly  indebted  for  its  popularity</span><span>  stances  of  tbe  country.  Although  Par</span><span>  liamentary  Reform  is  a  subject  with</span><span>  which  politicians  have  a  fuller  ac</span><span>  quaintance  than  with  most  others,  the</span><span>  difference  of  opinion  as  to  tbe  true  basis</span><span>  of  representation,  invariably  attaches  to</span><span>  its  discussion  a  factions  blindness  which</span><span>  is  opposed  to  the  reasonable  and  just</span><span>  decision  of  a  measure  which,  more  than</span><span>  any  other,  affects  the  condition  and</span><span>  welfare  of  a  people.  A  debate  on  repre</span><span>  sentative  or  electoral  rights  is  on  roost</span><span>  occasions  a  battle  of  factions.  It  is  the</span><span>  more  necessary,  therefore,  that  consti</span><span>  tuencies  should  make  their  decision  on</span><span>  the  question  known,  so  that  on  it  they</span><span>  should  be  truly  represented.</span><span>  It  is  so  ordinary  an  occurrence  for</span><span>  tbe  representative  to  differ  from  die  re</span><span>  presented  on  measures  of  Ibis  character</span><span>  that  unless  where  an  absolute  pledge</span><span>  exists  there  is.  no  security.  The  repre</span><span>  sentative  and  a  large  proportion  of  bis</span><span>  constituents  belong  to  classes  who  be</span><span>  lieve  their  interests  to  be  opposed  to</span><span>  each  other;  and,  if  unfettered,  tbe  re</span><span>  presentative  can  scarcely  be  blamed  if</span><span>  he  follow,  a  course  dictated  by  e  natural</span><span>  instinct  of  humanity.  Tbe  portion  of</span><span>  bis  constituents,  however,  who  are  likely  .</span><span>  to  be  '  prejudicially  affected  by  bis  act,</span><span>  should  save  him  from  tbe  reproach  of</span><span>  having  misrepresented  them,  and  them</span><span>  selves  from  being  improperly  treated,</span><span>  by  discussing  end  giving  expression  to</span></p> <p><span>  their  will  on  the  subject  long  before  it  '</span><span>  shall  have  become  the  duty  of  their</span><span>  nymbers  to  deoide  upon  it.  By  this</span><span>  means  they  may  avert  undesirable  -con-</span><span>  sequences,  or  at  least  save  themtalves</span><span>  from  the  appearance  of  having  assented</span><span>  to  a  measure,  that  may  withhold  from</span><span>  them  rights  to  which  they  are  justly</span><span>  entitled.</span><span>  Between  the  present  time  and  the</span><span>  opening  of  the  next  ^essian  xjf  Parlia</span><span>  ment,  every  town  and  .  agricultural  con</span><span>  stituency  or  section  of  a  constituency,</span><span>  ought  to  meet  and  discuss  the  question</span><span>  of  Parliamentary  and  Electoral  Reform  ;</span><span>  and  by  petition  make  known  to  their</span></p> <p><span>  members  and  the  Legislature  their  wishes</span><span>  on  a  measure  of  such  vital  import  to</span><span>  tbe  peace,  progress,  and  future  good</span><span>  government  of  the  country.  The</span><span>  course  of  action  we  point  out  must</span><span>  not  be  left  over  until  a  Bill  on  the</span><span>  subject  is  under  discussion.  It  will</span><span>  then  be  too  late,  and  in  the  meantime</span><span>  there  is  no  good  excuse  for  delay.</span><span>  There  are  few,  if  any,  of  the  electorates</span><span>  is  which  the  subject  of  Parliamentary</span><span>  representation  and  the  state  of  the</span><span>  Electoral  franchise  is  not  fully  under</span><span>  stood,  sb  well  as  the  nature  of  the</span><span>  creased  popnlation^anorVbe  defects</span><span>  observable  in  the  working  of  the  present</span><span>  scheme.  Why  delay  to  the  hut  hour</span><span>  a  duty  of  so  much  consequence,  «phen</span><span>  tbe  sooner  it  is  resolved,  the  more  like</span><span>  lihood  there  will  be  of  a  successful  and</span><span>  fair  result  1  It  is  not  when  parties  are</span><span>  contending  for  mastery,  that  conclu</span><span>  sions  arrived  at  from  sound  premises</span><span>  will  have  their  true  force,  nor  is  it</span><span>  then  that  representatives  can  be</span><span>  questioned  and  tested  as  regards  the</span><span>  accordance  of  their  opinions  with  those</span><span>  of  the  majority  of  their  constituents.</span><span>  We  believe  that  scarcely  a  single</span><span>  member  of  the  present  Legislative</span><span>  Assembly  is  pledged  to  his  constituents</span><span>  on  this  subject  No  doubt  there  is  an</span><span>  impression  on  the  minds  of  some  con</span><span>  stituencies,  that  from  the  general  be</span><span>  haviour  of  their  representatives  they  are</span><span>  sure  to  act  rightly  on  Parliamentary  and</span><span>  Electoral  Reform.  An  impression  of</span><span>  that  kind  is  but  a  frail  dependence  in</span></p> <p><span>  so  grave  a  business  as  the  dealing  with</span><span>  the  liberties  of  the  people.  There  have</span><span>  been  so  many  instances  in  -our  short</span><span>  Parliamentary  history  of  representa</span><span>  tives  who  changed  their  opinions  and</span><span>  deserted  principles  at  junctures  when</span><span>  their  manifestation  was  most  needed,</span><span>  tbat  constituencies  who  for  the  future</span><span>  leave  anything  to  chance,  may  be  said</span><span>  to  act  criminally  againBt  tbe  righta^f</span><span>  others  as  well  as  their  own.  But  allow</span><span>  ing  that  there  are  some  members  whose</span><span>  known  principles  and  liberality  are</span><span>  above  suspicion,  would  it  not  be  wise</span><span>  policy  for  them  to  join  their  constitu</span><span>  ents  in  initiating  a  'movement  that</span><span>  would  elucidate  the  opinion  of  the  co</span><span>  lony  on  this  question.

Sufficient  has  been  stated  to</span><span>  prove  the  absolute  necessity  of  early</span><span>  and  combined  action  on  the  part  of</span><span>  those  who  desire  fair  representation</span><span>  and  good  Government.

It.  may</span><span>  be  a  useless  waste  of  time  to  remind</span><span>  this  class,  that  similar  political  turpi</span><span>  tude  to  that  which  they  are  at  present</span><span>  pursuing  has  elsewhere  in  Australia  re</span><span>  ceived  a  heavy  retribution  ;  we  would</span><span>  not  desire  here  its  repetition,  but  we  can</span><span>  only  perceive  one  coarse  by  which  it</span><span>  can  be  averted,  and  that  is,  by  the</span><span>  squatter  resolving  to  act  impartially  for</span><span>  society  as  a  legislator,  or  to  altogether</span><span>  abstain  from  interfering  with  the  politics</span><span>  of  the  colony.</span><span>  As  matters  stand  at  present,  the</span><span>  ignorant  squatter  who  has  a  few</span><span>  loritaods  of  Bounds  invested  in  sheen</span></p> <p><span>  or  cattle,  is  silly  enough  to  assume  ,</span><span>  not  directly  embarked  in  the  6am  ;</span><span>  pursuit  ;  and  to  act,  if  chance  makes</span><span>  him  a  legislator,  in  such  a  manner  as  to</span><span>  mike  it  appsreut,  that  go  long  as  the</span><span>  interests  of  his  class  are  pampered  and</span><span>  protected  he  is  the  willing  and  insolent</span><span>  creature  of  theGovernment.  He  knows</span><span>  little  and  cares  little  for  social  relations</span><span>  or  the  reciprocity  that  subsists  between</span><span>  tbe,  several  sections  of  society.  So</span><span>  arrogant  has  been  the  expression  of</span><span>  these  assumptions  and  so  baneful</span><span>  to  good  Government  has  been</span><span>  the  presence  of  this  class</span><span>  in  the  Legislature  during  the  present</span><span>  session,  that  a  strong  impression  is</span><span>  abroad  that  an  absolute  government</span><span>  lodged  in  an  individual  would  be  less</span><span>  obnoxions  than  a  Parliamentary  system</span><span>  in  which  they  constitute  the  majority.</span><span>  We  do  not  go  bo  far.  But,  we  cer</span><span>  tainly,  think  that  the  time  has  arrived</span><span>  when  the  people  are  in  a.  position  to</span><span>  demand  that  they  should  be  fairly  and</span><span>  honestly  governed,  and  that  any  ob</span><span>  struction  to  so  desirable  a  consumma</span><span>  tion  should  be  at  once  removed.  This</span><span>  is  not  to  be  achieved  by  Parliamentary</span><span>  representation/%ecau6e  under  the  pre</span><span>  sent  system  the  people  are  not  repre</span><span>  sented  in  their  fair  proportion.  Let</span><span>  the  people,  however,  be  true  to  them</span><span>  selves  and  to  the  best  interests  of  the</span><span>  country,  let  petty  differences  be  cast</span><span>  aside,  and  by  united  action  in  public</span><span>  meeting  and  by  petition  claim,  that</span><span>  in  the  reform  of  the  present  law  all  class</span><span>  dominancy  be  swept  away.  Every  man</span><span>  in  the  country  is  interested  in  the  fair</span><span>  treatment  of  fiie  squatter  while  he  iea</span><span>  producer,  but  he  is  also  interested  in</span><span>  the  growth  of  other  industries  and  in</span><span>  the  win  and  equitable  government  of</span></p> <p><span>  abolishing  a  dbminancy  which  has</span><span>  hitherto  been  remarkable  for  tie</span><span>  enrontery  with  which  it  has  bolstered</span><span>  up  bad  government  and  enabled</span><span>  ministers  to  disregard  the  law  and  the</span><span>  wishes  of  the  great  body  of  the  people.</span><span>  Wans  each  succeeding  European  mail</span><span>  brings  intelligence  of  the  increasing</span><span>  complinriions  of  European  politics,</span><span>  arid  the  imminent  likelihood  of  a</span><span>  ?Kuttipfin  war  on  a  vast  scale,  in  which</span><span>  6«ea  Britain  will  eventually  be  com</span><span>  pelledio  take  fextt  our  ntbmtal  legisla</span><span>  tors  i  gem  .to  regsM  such  an  event  with</span><span>  irjail  eftsnee,  as  little  w  not  at  all</span><span>  mfiec  ing  our  interest.

It  does  not  in  fact  keep</span><span>  pace  with  the  requirements  of  the  times.</span><span>  A  considerable  portion  of  what  land  is</span><span>  surveyed  is  unsuited  for  agricultural</span><span>  purposes,  and  f  hus  the  cost  of  survey  is</span><span>  jbo  far  thrown  f.way.  The  limited  extent</span><span>  of.  purvey  is  attributed  to  the  narrow</span><span>  nes  of  the  means  voted  for  its  cost  ;</span><span>  but  the  injudicious  selection  of  country</span><span>  admits  of  no  sueh^excuse;  audit  may</span><span>  not  be  without  good  if  we  consider  how</span><span>  both  defects  can  be  tsest  amended.</span><span>  We  are  not  disposed  to  admit  that</span><span>  iSetspSem  ofjjtfc  Q»rve  J  UEpaMasaiiiTB</span><span>  altogether  asflfficient  or  economical  as</span><span>  it  might  be.  There  seems  to  us  too</span><span>  litUe  classification  of  skill  with  reference</span><span>  to  the  kind  of  work  on  which  it  is  em</span><span>  ployed  to  justify  such  an  admission.  A</span><span>  quantity  of  land  is  directed  to  be  sur</span><span>  veyed,  and  a  surveyor  is  despatched  for</span><span>  the  purpose.  Bte  remains  till  the</span><span>  whole  —  bad  and  good  alike  —  has  been</span><span>  divided  into  the  intended  number  of</span><span>  farms,  and  whtm  he  has  completed  his</span><span>  work  in  one  locality  he  is  sent  to  another</span><span>  if  the  year's  funds  last  out  to  repeat</span><span>  the  process.  This,  we  take  leave  to  say,</span><span>  is  not  in  accordance  with  sound  system,</span><span>  or  with  tiie  economy  which  itis  desirable</span><span>  to  maintain.  ?</span><span>  Iu  all  work  that  is  the  nicest</span><span>  economy  which,  apportions  labor  to</span><span>  service.  It  is  on  this  principle  that</span><span>  the  highest  kinds  of  skill  demand  the</span><span>  highest  rates  of  remuneration.  To  set</span><span>  a  sculptor  upon  merely  squaring</span><span>  stones  for  a  building  and  yet  pay  him</span><span>  for  his  time  at  the  rate  he  would  re-;</span><span>  ceive  for  earring  a  status,  would  be  no</span><span>  slight  folly.  For  the  return  from  b-s</span><span>  labor  would  bo  very  different  in  the</span><span>  two  oases.  In  one  locality  there  nay</span><span>  be,  and  very  frequently  are,  two  ex</span><span>  treme  ussoriptbus  of  Boii-^thfi  verv</span><span>  good  upl  Of  vety  tali  -Yfefl}bronjj!tf</span></p> <p><span>  ^^  '^  ^^  ^  ^^^^M</span><span>  into  the  market  the  first  sells  at  a</span><span>  tolerably  high  prices,  the  second  not  at</span><span>  alL  Now-  to  employ  equally  costly</span><span>  skill  to  survey  both  is  to  imitate  the</span><span>  case  of  the  sculptor  so  for  as  results</span><span>  are  in  question.  In  the  case  of  the</span><span>  bad  laad  it  is  labor  and  expense  fora</span><span>  considerable  time,  if  not  altogether,</span><span>  thrown  away.  We  do  not  contend  for</span><span>  the  mere  picking  out  of  a  farm  here</span><span>  »nd  a  firm  there,  but  what  is  practica</span><span>  ble  and  what  ought  to  be  done  is  the</span><span>  selection  of  generally  good  land  and</span><span>  the  exclusion  of  that  of  kaown  very  in</span><span>  ferior  quality  from  our  detailed  surveys.</span><span>  When  in  time  the  complete  occupation</span><span>  of  really  available  soil  has  affixed  a</span><span>  value  to  that  in  its  'contiguity  which</span><span>  otherwise  it  would  not  possess,  a  value</span><span>  eqnaUingorapproximatingtothcpresent</span><span>  price  of  good  land,  it  will  be  time</span><span>  enough  to  expend  the  outlay  necessary</span><span>  for  .its  division,  until  then  it  had  better</span><span>  be  left  undisturbed  iu  its  sterility.</span><span>  It  appears  to  us  that  the  attainment</span><span>  of  such  an  object  is  easy.  If  the  sur</span><span>  veyors  in  the  direct  employment  of  the</span><span>  department  were  instructed  to  carry</span><span>  the  boundary  lines  of  continuous  and</span><span>  connected  areas,  and  to  report  on  the</span><span>  character  of  the  soil  composed  within</span><span>  them  as  they  proceeded,  the  Surveyor*</span><span>  General  would  accumulate  a  mass  of  in</span><span>  iBffgtt.  jSaBttWE,  tire  CPuntrjEr</span><span>  to  towns  and  gradually  expanding,</span><span>  which  otherwise  he  will  not  find  it  easy</span><span>  to  get.  He  wonld  besides  be  really</span><span>  surveying  the  colony  as  the  population</span><span>  settled  it,  and  obtaining  correct  and</span><span>  connected  outlines  radiating  from  the</span><span>  different  centres  where  his  branch  offi</span><span>  ces  are  settled,  instead  of  isolated  bits</span><span>  of  survey  here  and  there  connected</span><span>  with  nothing.  The  character  of  the</span><span>  country  being  known,  and  the  most</span><span>  valuable  portions  chosen  for  division,</span><span>  that  process  might  be  subjected  to  con</span><span>  tract.  There  are  numbers  of  experi</span><span>  enced  and  competent  bush  surveyors  in</span><span>  the  adjoining  colonies  who  would  readily</span><span>  tender  for  the  subdivision  of  blocta  at</span><span>  prices'  much  below  the  average  cost  of</span><span>  filling  in  at  present.  And  this  economy</span><span>  would  be  obtained  by  a  double  process.</span><span>  The  land  brought  into  the  market  would</span><span>  fetch  a  higher  price  in  proportion  to</span><span>  the  cost  of  bringing  it  there  than  it</span><span>  does  now,  while  the  actual  cost  of  the</span><span>  work  would  be  lessened  from  the  com</span><span>  petition  for  it.  The  votes  of  Parlia</span><span>  ment  would  then  be  so  expended  as  to</span><span>  secure  the  utmost  possible  return  for  its</span><span>  outlay.</span><span>  We  make  the  suggestions  iu  no  spirit</span><span>  of  hostility  to  the  Surveyor-General  or</span><span>  his  officers,  but  simply  with  a  desire</span><span>  that  the  department  should  be  brought</span><span>  up  to  the  requirements  of  the  time.</span><span>  We  are  quite  sure  that  now—  with  all</span><span>  the  activity  that  has  been  shown  in  the</span><span>  early  portion  of  the  year,  there  is</span><span>  scarcely  any  really  good  land  available</span><span>  for  selection,  while  there  is,  no  doubt,  a</span><span>  considerable  quantity  of  bad  land  sur</span><span>  veyed,  and  likely  to  remain  unselected.</span><span>  If,  indeed,  one  were  to  judge  of  the</span><span>  object  of  settlement  from  the  quality  of</span><span>  the  land  provided  for  it,  one  might  often</span><span>  mentahzing  1ipon*T5ad  soil.  'But  we</span><span>  submit  this  sort  of  philosophic  enquiry</span><span>  B  not  that  most  likely  to  tempt  immi</span><span>  grants  or  make  good  colonists.  First</span><span>  come  first  served  is  the  best  maxim  in</span><span>  this  instance,  and  ought  to  be  acted</span><span>  upon.  There  are,  indeed,  some  persons</span><span>  who  cannot  grasp  two  ideas  at  once  ;</span><span>  who  cry  out  against  the  non-survey  of</span><span>  the  inferior  laud,  on  the  ground  that</span><span>  we  are  prodigally  expending  our  best</span><span>  material  at  once,  instead  of  selling  good</span><span>  and  bad  together  to  realize  a  fair</span><span>  average  price.  But  such  objections</span><span>  are  exceedingly  absurd.  Practically,</span><span>  to  carry  the  principle  out  in  its</span><span>  thorough  integrity,  no  good  land  ought</span><span>  to  be  sold  at  all  until  the  bad  is  ex</span><span>  hausted.  That  would  be  one  way  of</span><span>  getting  a  good  price  for  it.  In  the  next</span><span>  place,  the  survey  of  bad  land</span><span>  soon  becomes  futile,  for  settlers</span><span>  won't  buy  it,  and  the  time</span><span>  occupied  in  bringing  it  into  the</span><span>  market  is  thus  lost.  It  might  have</span><span>  been  far  more  profitably  employed  in</span><span>  in  surveying  more  good  land.  And,</span><span>  lastly,  the  inferior  land  must  ultimately</span><span>  bring  its  highest  price  when  occupation</span><span>  in  its  vicinity  has  given  it  the  value  it</span><span>  could  never  otherwise  possess.  Mean</span><span>  time  we  should  sell  more  of  our  sur</span><span>  veyed  land,  and  thus  practically  reduce</span><span>  the  cost  of  survey,  as  well  as  facilitate</span><span>  the  process  of  settlement  For  both</span><span>  these  purposes  we  trust  to  see  an</span><span>  amendment  in  the  survey  system.</span><span>  ?  ?</span><span>  At  length,  after  difficulties  innumerable,</span><span>  we  have  succeeded  in  'getting  up  steam'</span><span>  on  oar  own  account.

To  these  we  reply  that</span><span>  all  precedent  in  the  caBe  of  Emigration</span><span>  is  against  them.  New.  South  Wales</span><span>  could  atone  time  indue*  die  Emigration</span><span>  of  thousands'  yearly  ?  the  'scheme  was</span><span>  interfered  with  and  fell  into  disuse:</span><span>  and,  lately  two  of  the  most  talented</span><span>  men  in  the  fcplony  eent  to  Great</span><span>  Britain  as  Commissiqners  could  not</span><span>  revive  it.  Victoria,  at  one  time  the</span><span>  cynosure  in  the  eyes  of  the  British</span><span>  laborer,  objected  to  Emigration:  and  eet.</span><span>  its  face  against  voting  a  penny  to  assist</span><span>  the  emigrant.  The  fetnous  lector?  of</span><span>  Mr.  Mechie  on  the  subject  will  prove</span><span>  how  sincerely  the  wise  men  '  cf  the</span><span>  country  afterwards  bewailed  the  suicidal</span><span>  policy  ;  and  late  votes  of  the  legislature</span><span>  and  the  presence  of  Mr.  Knight  in</span><span>  England  explain  hpw  glad  the  colony</span><span>  would  be  to  regain  her  former  standiug</span><span>  in  the  estimation  of  emigrants.</span><span>  Looking  at  the  assisted  scheme  of</span><span>  MessHs.  Hebbe&t  and  Jordan,  one  is</span><span>  inclined  to  doubt  the  eanity  of  its</span><span>  framers.  It  proposes  to  do  for.  £14,</span><span>  that  tUckoadV  oT  the  Qeiehbourine</span></p> <p><span>  colonies  are  ready  to  do  for  £6  %?  —  viz  :</span><span>  —  to  bring  a  man  and  his  wife,  in,  «very</span><span>  way  suitable,  to  Australia.  Wherein</span><span>  exists  the  inducements  to.  pay  tie  ad</span><span>  ditional  £6  V  Are  our  wages  higher,  is</span><span>  our  climate  better,  or  do  ire  stand  on  a</span><span>  par  with  our  neighbours  in  the  numer</span><span>  ous  appliances  for  comfort,  for  easy</span><span>  trapsit,and  for  enjoyment  of  spare  time?</span><span>  In  none  of  these  respects  are  we</span><span>  superior  to  our  neighbours,  and  in  most</span><span>  of  them  very  much  inferior.  Is  it  to</span><span>  be  fiunposed  that  the  other  colonies  will  I</span><span>  not.  make  use  of  these  facts?  So  all  i</span><span>  engrossing  to  Messrs.  HebbesH</span><span>  and  Jordan  was  the  successful</span><span>  action  of  the  Queensland  Emigration</span><span>  Society  that  they  could  see  no  -other</span><span>  aspect  of  the  subject  than  that  '.which</span><span>  would  enable  them  to  place  themselves</span><span>  in  the  position  of  that  Society.-  But</span><span>  even  there  they  betrayed  gross  .igno</span><span>  rance  of  the  whole  matter.  Admitting</span><span>  for  the  sake  of  argument,  that  the  -people</span><span>  of  Ireland,  who  could  afford  such  a  con</span><span>  tribution,  were  willing  to  give  donations</span><span>  of  £6  or  £8  to  the  immigration  Society,</span><span>  these  were  to  obtain  services  and  ensure</span><span>  social  decencies  that  ihe  Colonial  Sec</span><span>  retary  and  his  Emigration  .Commis</span></p> <p><span>  sioner  can  never  provide.  So  that  in</span><span>  taking  as  their  model  a  special-  institu</span><span>  tion  they  displayed  their  want  of</span><span>  knowledge  and  incapacity.</span><span>  It  may  be  that  the  distress  in  the</span><span>  cottou  manufacturing  districts,  and  the</span><span>  desire  of  Poor  Law  Guardians  to  get</span><span>  rid  of  a  class  who  are  paupers  at  all</span><span>  times  but  in  the  most  busy  seasons,  may</span><span>  enable  Mr.  Jordan  to  carry:  on  his</span><span>  scheme  for  a  time  ;  but.  when  we  look</span><span>  on  the  opinions  expressed  on  Emigra</span><span>  tion  to  Queensland  in  England,'  to  the</span><span>  rivalry  -with  -which  it  will  have  to  con</span><span>  tend,  and  to  the  illiberal  and  sectarian</span><span>  believe  that  the  first  blow  has  been  dealt</span><span>  to  pur  Immigration  .  Jt  may.  suit  men</span><span>  whose  stake  in  the  colony  is  represented</span><span>  by  their  salary  to  impede  Immigration,</span><span>  rather  than  allow  the  introduction  of  a</span><span>  people  who  differ  with  them  in  faith,  or</span><span>  against  whom  they  have  an  unmeaning</span><span>  antipathy,-  bat  will  their  prejudices</span><span>  increase  the  rent-roll  of  the  landlord,</span><span>  the  operations  and  profits  of  the'  squat</span><span>  ter  or  agriculturist,  the  business  of  the</span><span>  merchant  or  trader,  the  Customs'  re</span><span>  venue,  public  works,  or  people  our  al</span><span>  most  countless  acres  %  —  Assuredly  not</span><span>  And  time  will  prove  that  the  late  re</span><span>  strictions  on  Immigration  will  preju</span><span>  dice  -every  interest  in  the  country.</span><span>  Going  from:  the  -scheme  of  assisted</span><span>  Immigration  to  the  class  which  are  to</span><span>  pay  their  own  passages,  the  alterations</span><span>  made  are  in  every  respect  disadvantage</span><span>  ous  to  the  colony.  The  reduction  in</span><span>  the  case  of  steerage  passengers,  to</span><span>  eighteen  acres,  when  generally  rinown</span><span>  in  Great  Britain,  will  greatly  decrease</span><span>  the  number  of  this  class  of  emigrants.</span><span>  Persons  at  all  desirous  of  coming  to</span><span>  Queensland  as  paying  passengers,  will</span><span>  by  some  means  raise  the  difference  be</span><span>  tween  a  eteerage  and  intermediate  pas</span><span>  sage,  which  is  only  £3  per  adult  ;  the.</span><span>  colony  2wiU  have  to  give  the  thirty  acres</span><span>  of  land,  and  both  the  colony  and  -the</span><span>  Immigrant  '  will  be  made  poorer  by  the</span><span>  sum  paid  additional  by  him  for  inter</span><span>  mediate  passages.  Then,  agpn,  the</span><span>  changing  the  Land  Order  *  into  a</span><span>  'location  ticket'  for  thirty  acres</span><span>  of  land  not  transferable,  and</span><span>  which  the  Immigrant  cannot  con</span><span>  vert  for  two  years,  will  in  many  cases</span><span>  be  a  direct  barrier  in  the  waj_of  the</span><span>  emigrant  in  selecting  Queensland  as  his</span><span>  home.

The</span><span>  Opposition  organ  of  the  time  (the</span><span>  Courier)  did  not  hesitate  to  express  that</span><span>  suspicion,  aad  with  it  no  mild  censure</span><span>  of  its  object.  Prior  to  that  resignation</span><span>  there  were  not  wanting  hints  and</span><span>  regrets  and  all  tbe  machinery  which  a</span><span>  suspecting  party  put  in  operation  of  a</span><span>  fax  more  popular  leader  than  Mr.  Baff</span><span>  has  ever  been.  We  take  but  the  expres</span><span>  sion  of  opinion  emanating  from  the  bulk</span><span>  of  the  Opposition  themselves,  and  taking</span><span>  this  we  are  at  liberty—  nay,  we  have  a</span><span>  legitimate  right  —  to  ask  an'what  prin</span><span>  ciple  are  the  gentlemen  calling  tiem</span><span>  eelyes  tbe  Opposition  banded  together  ?</span><span>  Circumstanced  as  this  colony  ie,  the</span><span>  question  of  Education  is  one  of  no</span><span>  email  importance.  The*  heads  of  the</span><span>  two  religious  bodies  which  are  the  most</span><span>  important  in  number  and  property,  are</span><span>  opposed  to  the  existing  system.  What</span><span>  are  the  opinions  of  Mr.  Mackenzie,</span><span>  Mr.  Douglas,  Mr.  IiiLMY,  and  Mr.</span><span>  Raff,  as  we  collect  from  their  speeches  ?</span><span>  Mr.  Mackenzie  and  Mr.  Raff  are  de</span><span>  cidedly  in  favor  of  things  as  they  arc.</span><span>  Mr.  Ltixev's  sentiments  remain  in  a</span><span>  clever  and  lawyer-like  obscurity  —  nei-</span><span>  ther  precisely  national  as  things  are,</span><span>  nor  denominational  as  they  might  be  —</span><span>  and  Mr.  Douglas  bas  scarcely  spoken</span><span>  with  that  erplieitiiess  which  we  have</span><span>  a  right  to  expect  from  so  clear-headed</span><span>  a  man,  although  indications  are  not</span><span>  wanting  of  the  real  bent  of</span><span>  his  mind.  Let  us  pursue  the  enquiry</span><span>  farther,  and  ask  what  is  the  agreement</span><span>  upon  the  franchise  and  upon  the  distri</span><span>  bution  of  electoral  districts.  They</span><span>  would  be  puzzled  to  tell,  and  we  to</span><span>  understand.  The  Ministerial  phalanx</span><span>  in  this  matter  are  far  dearer  in  their</span></p> <p><span>  purpose  and  steadier  in  their  aim.  The</span><span>  followers  have  only  to  settle  their  own</span><span>  interest,  and  the  leaders  fix  its  direc-  '</span><span>  tion.  The  Opposition  leaders  have  j</span><span>  not  yet  agreed  upon  what  their  aim  is,  I</span><span>  if  they  have  any  ;  and  upon  a  very  I</span><span>  grave  question  —  tbe  whole  basis  of  the</span><span>  financial  operations  of  the  colony  —  the</span><span>  laEt  night  or  tiro  of  the  Ecssion  dis</span><span>  closed  a  marvellous  disagreement.  The</span><span>  cause  was  clear  enough.  Mr.  Douglas</span><span>  did  know  on  what  princij/le  he  acted.</span><span>  The  doctrines  of  expediency  guided  his</span><span>  then  colleagues,  and  the  result  was  just</span><span>  what  might  have  been  expected  to,  and</span><span>  did  actually,  occur.  They  were  left  to</span><span>  a  happy  unmopolT  of  'Vbai  acquleseace</span><span>  which  left  tbe  Ministry  leaders  and</span><span>  themselves  something  less  than  tools.</span><span>  This  being  the  state  of  things,  there</span><span>  is,  to  nse  tbe  language  of  the  law,  at</span><span>  least  a  court  of  ultimate  resort  —  the</span><span>  feeling  of  the  public  at  large.  Up  to</span><span>  the  present  time,  except  as  regards  the</span><span>  emigration  question,  that  feeling  has</span><span>  been  culpably  allowed  to  slumber.  In</span><span>  times  when  political  honesty  is  derelict,</span><span>  and  they  who  should  lead  the  fight</span><span>  give  no  souud,  or.  at  least  an  uncertain</span><span>  one,  such  a  result  is  not  to  be  wondered</span></p> <p><span>  at.  They  who  daub  the  wall  with  un</span><span>  tempered  mortar  must  not  wonder  if  it  :</span><span>  fiill  beneath  them.  But,  for  the  good</span><span>  o-  the  public  —  for  the  direct  prosperity</span><span>  of  every  individual  it  numbers,  it  is</span><span>  essential  that  some  understanding</span><span>  should  be  come  to  —  some  agreement</span><span>  arrived  at  —  as  to  the  course  which  is  to</span><span>  be  followed  on  the  inside  of  Parliament,</span><span>  and  supported  by  those  who  may  hap*</span><span>  pen  to  be  without  ita  sacred  walls.</span><span>  Without  that  support,  the  Opposition</span><span>  are  but  a  shadow  —  with  it,  they</span><span>  must  command  the  respect,  if  they</span><span>  do  not  just  now  ensure  the  defeat  of</span><span>  their  opponents.  Let  us  then  see  what</span><span>  remains  in  onr  power  to  ensure  that</span><span>  organization  without  which  any  party</span><span>  is  but  a  wretched  sham.  Tbe  organi</span><span>  zation  based  upon  principle  —  upon</span><span>  principle  so  plain  that  all  can  under</span><span>  stand,  and  which  even  those  who  abhor</span><span>  must  still  respect</span><span>  What  are  tbe  principles  upon  which</span><span>  opposition  to  the  present  Ministry  is  to</span><span>  be  based  %  Are  they  constitutional  —</span><span>  are  they  founded  upon  local  circum</span><span>  stances-—  do  they  arise  oat  of  a  well</span><span>  grounded  suspicion  of  the  character  of</span><span>  tbe  men  with  whom  we  have  to  deal?</span><span>  Whether  one  or  all  are  to  be  the  reli</span></p> <p><span>  able  grounds  of  public  action  it  behoves</span><span>  public  men  to  weigh  them  well,  to</span><span>  eliminate  from  them  '  the  guide</span><span>  to  their  own  procedure  —  and</span><span>  when  in  all  care,  and  temper,</span><span>  and  prudence  this  has  been  done  to</span><span>  arm  the  public  mind  with  argument  —</span><span>  to  strengthen  it  with  the  consciousness</span><span>  of  right  —  to  bring  it  down  with  the  ir</span><span>  resistable-potrer  of  universal  opinion  —</span><span>  upon  tbe  enemies  to  our  social  and  po</span><span>  litical  progress.  No  public  opinion  bas</span><span>  ever  yet  been  framed  unless  spon  the</span><span>  action  of  some  energetic  and  sagacious</span><span>  leaders.

G.  WtLsoK  has  begged  the</span><span>  real  issue,  that  be  has  wilfully  miscon</span><span>  strued  tbe  object  of  our  remarks,  and</span><span>  that  he  has  made  uncalled  for,extraneous</span><span>  allusions  and  statements  in  his  com-  '</span><span>  munication.  ?  ?</span><span>  When  first  referring  to  the  official</span><span>  Chaplaincy  of  tbe  Fiery  Star,  we  em</span><span>  bodied  in  our  remarks  the  anticipation</span><span>  of  each  an  accusation  as  the  one  whiob.</span><span>  has  since  been  made  by  Mr.  Wilson  ;</span><span>  and,  therefore,  were  not  surprised</span><span>  when  it  was  made,  although</span><span>  we  might  have  reasonably  looked  for</span><span>  more  candour  and  fewer  insinuations  :</span><span>  than  have  resulted.  But  having  entered</span><span>  on  the  only  course  compatible  with</span><span>  public  duty,  we  shall  not  shrink  from</span><span>  its  pursuit,  because  onr  treatment  of  it</span><span>  has  been  cavilled  at  on  very  insufficient</span><span>  and  flimsy  arguments.</span><span>  Tbe  grievance  of  which  complaint</span><span>  was  made,  was  the  appointment,  by  the</span><span>  Emigration  Agent,  of  an  individual  to</span><span>  the  official  Chaplaincy  of  tbe  vessel,</span><span>  who  neither  by  agreement  in  religious</span><span>  opinion  with  three-fourths  of  the  pas</span><span>  sengers,  nor  by  bis  conduct  in  defining</span><span>  propriety  and  moral  behaviour  was</span><span>  fitted  for  the  position.  The  question  of</span><span>  free  passage  or  gratuity  was  of  secon</span><span>  dary  importance,  and  although  it  would</span><span>  have  increased  the  ill-consequences  of</span><span>  Mr.  Joiidas's  excess  of  authority,  the</span><span>  mere  fact  of  the  service  beiug  per</span><span>  formed  gratuitously  was  no  justification</span><span>  for  the  commission  of  au  unauthorised</span><span>  act  or  for  subjecting  the  officers</span><span>  and  passengers  of  the  vessel</span><span>  to  an  official  censorship  which</span><span>  they  could  neither  respect  nor</span><span>  acknowledge,  aud  whose  interference</span><span>  they  viewed  as  aa  insult.  Mr.  Wilson</span><span>  is  as  well  aware  of  the  nature  of  Mr.</span><span>  Jordan's  authority  for  the  appointment</span><span>  of  Chaplains  to  Emigrant  vessels  as  we</span><span>  are  ;  therefore  he  avoided  the  main</span><span>  question,  as  well  as  any  statement  of  the</span><span>  number  of  Mr  Hixtos's  co-religionists</span><span>  on  board  of  the  '  Fiery  Star,'  kuowing</span><span>  that  the  evidence  would  not  serve  bis</span><span>  purpose.</span><span>  In  placing  the  just  complaint  of  the</span><span>  passengers  of  the  '  Fiery  Star'  before</span><span>  the  public.it  was  oawntial  to  ollnrlo  to</span><span>  soino  of  tbe  objections  nindc  to  sub</span><span>  mission  to  Mr.  Uiktok's  official  autho</span><span>  rity  as  Chaplain.  Tiie  fen*  which  we</span><span>  stated  were  taken  at  random  from</span><span>  a  whole  host  detailed  to  us,  aud  were</span><span>  certainly  not  more  personal  than  tbe</span><span>  others.  In  our  selection  we  were</span><span>  guided  by  the  bearing  of  the  complaints</span><span>  on  the  grievance  and  not  by  motives  of</span><span>  personal  consideration.  Mr.  Wilson</span><span>  may  erect  any  standard  of  fitness  which</span><span>  he  pleases  for  the  ministry,  iu  regard  to</span><span>  1  himself  and  those  who  think  with</span></p> <p><span>  him  ;  but  as  the  majority  of</span><span>  Christians  eotertain  very  dif</span><span>  ferent  views  to  those  which  may  be</span><span>  inferred  from  bis  arguments,  it  is</span><span>  absurd  to  plead  a  sectional  practice  as</span><span>  a  warrant  for  an  action  mainly  of  con</span><span>  sequence  to  individuals  who  do  not</span><span>  believe  in  that  practice.  Did  we  con</span><span>  sider  it  at  all  necessary  to  the  treatment</span><span>  of  the  subject,  we  could  show  that  Mr.</span><span>  Button's  qualification  for  the  ministry</span><span>  of  religion  is  neither  upon  a  level  with</span><span>  the  fishermen  of  Galilee,  nor  tbe  tent</span><span>  maker  of  Tarsus  ;  but  such  an  argument</span><span>  is  beyond  our  province.  With  tbe</span><span>  theological  aspect  of  the  question  we</span><span>  have  nothing  to  do.  We  take  the</span><span>  practice  of  tbe  various  sections  of</span><span>  Christians  as  we  £nd  it  in  relation  to</span><span>  the  ministry,  and  also  in  relation  to</span><span>  other  professions  of  less  importance,</span><span>  aud  we  know  that  society  requires  that</span><span>  the  doctor,  tie  lawyer,  and  the  clergy</span><span>  man  should  each  be  educated  and  set</span><span>  apart  for  bis  vocation.  Society  gene</span><span>  rally  demands  that  persons  engaged  in</span><span>  either  of  these  callings  should  be,  in</span><span>  the  best  sense  of  the  designa</span><span>  tion,  gentlemen.  It  is  no  argu</span><span>  ment  against  the  practice,  be</span><span>  cause  a  fraction  may  be  con</span><span>  tent  with  tbe  nostrums  of  a  quack</span><span>  doctor,  or  be  led  into  endless  litigation</span><span>  by  a  bosh-lawyer,  or  receive  tbe  ordi</span><span>  nances  of  religion  at  the  hands  of  an</span><span>  arrogant  pretender,  or  weak-minded  and</span><span>  uneducated  enthusiast,  that  therefore</span><span>  a  nnmber  of  people,  holding  the  general</span><span>  belief  on  the  essentials  for  the  learned</span><span>  professions,  should  be  compelled  to  re</span><span>  cognise  their  authority.</span><span>  .  Mr.  Wilson  has  endeavoured  to  make</span><span>  capital  out  of  onr  silence,  with  reference</span><span>  to  two  Catholic  clergymen  who  came  as</span><span>  passengers  -  by  die  Fiery  Star,  asking,</span><span>  whether  we  bad  enquired  into  their</span><span>  1  pcevious  calling,  or  whether  or  not  they</span><span>  had  receive  free  passages  ?  We  can  see</span><span>  no  possible  connection  between.  the</span><span>  position  of  these  gentlemen,  and  tbe</span><span>  question  relating  to'  the  official  Chap</span><span>  iJaincy  of  Mr.-  HlNTOtf.  But,  for  Mr.</span><span>  -Wosoifc  satisfaction,  we  are  glad.to  be.</span><span>  Able  to  inform  him,  that  as  a  general</span><span>  rale,  Catholic  clergymen  are  'trained</span><span>  from  -  yoatk  :  to  ?  flieir.  voca</span><span>  tion  ;  that  -  these  clergymen's</span><span>  passages  were  neither  the  gift  of  the</span><span>  Government  nor  thesbippers,  that  they</span><span>  had  -  no  official  appointments  as  C9uu-</span><span>  laiBB,.  and  jonly  looked  to  the  spiri</span><span>  tual  welfare  of  those  who  agreed</span><span>  with  them  in  fcith,  and  that  their  cbn</span><span>  dnot  asugeudemen  met  the  approval</span><span>  eod  respect  of  their  feUow-paBscngers.</span><span>  ttis  query  of  tbe  writer,  aud  an  allu</span><span>  sion  elsewh*r%iirhis  letter  to  protesting</span><span>  against  the  evils  of  the  world  while</span><span>  'shnt  ap  in  i  doister,'  indicate  the</span><span>  animus  ia  Itr.

In  this,  however,  he  will  be  as</span><span>  unsuccessful  as  he  has  been  rash  in  at-  i</span><span>  tempting  to  defend  a  most  unjustifiable</span><span>  stretch  of  authority  on  the  part  of  tbe</span><span>  Emigration  Agent.</span><span>  Had  Mr.  Hinton  restricted  bis  offl</span><span>  ciousnesa  to  reprehending  the  drunkard</span><span>  or  to  reproving  young  men  who  forgot</span><span>  how  to  conduct  themselves,  no  man  of</span><span>  sense  or  discretion  would  have  objected</span><span>  to  his  interference.  But  when  an  indi</span><span>  vidual's  notions  of  godliness  are  so</span><span>  sombre  as  to  cause  him  to  interfere</span><span>  with  every  species  of  rational  recreation</span><span>  and  to  insult  all  who  would  not  join  in</span><span>  his  condemnation,  the  exercise  of  any</span><span>  authority  by  such  a  person  in  tbe  nar</span><span>  row  limits  of  a  ship  during  a  long  voy</span><span>  age  is  little  less  than  a  commonnuisauce.</span><span>  With  Mr.  Bikton'9  authority  in</span><span>  the  Baptist  connection  we  have  nothing</span><span>  to  do,  and  if  he  bad  come  in  the</span><span>  '  Fiery  Star  '  as  Chaplain  to  such  of</span><span>  that  sect  as  were  on  board,  instead  of</span><span>  coming  .as  the  official  Chaplain  of  the</span><span>  vessel,  his  gratuitous  efforts  to  .  do  good</span><span>  and  set  a  good  example  would  -in  all</span><span>  probability  have  gained  Mm  general</span><span>  respect  instead  of  enmity.  He  chose</span><span>  for  himself,  however,  and  in  accepting</span><span>  a  title  to  which  he  had  no  claim  left</span><span>  himself  open  to  the  question  of  his</span><span>  motives  and  criticism  as  a  public  ser</span><span>  vant.  That  Mr.  Hinton  understood</span><span>  the  mistake  which  he  had  made,  is  to  be</span><span>  iufcrred  from  the  letter  which  he  ad</span><span>  dressed  to  us  after  the  publication  of</span><span>  the  comments  to  which  Mr.  Wilson</span><span>  takes  exception;  in  that  letter  he</span><span>  makes  no  deuial  of  our  statements  nor</span><span>  accuses  us  of  dealing  unfairly  by  him.</span><span>  It  remained  for  Mr.  Wilson  to  agitate</span><span>  a  question  which  would  have  been  better</span><span>  allowed  to  rest  aftercalline  the  attention</span><span>  of  the  Government  to  Sir.  Jordan's</span><span>  unauthorised  act,  so  as  to  prevent  ita</span><span>  repetition.  In  the  agitation  of  the</span><span>  subject,  Mr.  Witsox  has  displayed  bis</span><span>  powers  of  insinuation,  exaggeration,</span><span>  and  equivocation.  As  a  sample  of  this</span><span>  latter  qualification  we  refer  to  his  as</span><span>  sertion,  that  Mr.  HixtoN  was  ordained</span><span>  a  minister  by  a  '  Metropolitan  Bishop,</span><span>  tliat  is  by  a  Bishop  of  a  Metropolitan</span><span>  Church.'  Now  as  there  are  only  two</span><span>  denominations  which  use  the  name  or</span><span>  office  of  bishop,  and  as  we  are  credibly</span><span>  informed  that  Mr.  IIixton  was  never</span><span>  associated  with  either  of  these  two,  how</span><span>  is  the  statement  to  be  reconciled  with</span><span>  truth  ?  It  is  not  sufficient  for  a  per</span><span>  son  iu  Mr.  Wilson's  present  position</span><span>  to  be  able  to  explain  away  the  seeming</span><span>  untruth  by  dubbiug  himself  or  any</span><span>  person  in  a  like  position  with  such  a</span><span>  title  ;  if  any  number  of  men  were  asked</span><span>  to  name  tbe  Bishops  in  Brisbane,  they</span><span>  would  certainly  not  include  Mr.  Wu-</span><span>  eon  amongst  the  number.  Nor  can</span><span>  any  statement  requiring  such  au  expla</span><span>  nation  be  accepted  as  being  in  strict</span><span>  conformity  with  the  injiiiiftioti  —  «  T^»t</span><span>  your  yea  be  yea,  and  nay,  nay.'</span><span>  Mr.  Wilson  also  makes  an  effort  to</span><span>  place  us  iu  a  false  position  with  the</span><span>  Baptists  of  Brisbane.  As  to  our  fellow</span><span>  citizeus,  iu  our  public  capacity,  we</span><span>  kuon-  none  of  them  as  belonging  to  any</span><span>  religious  denomination  ;  so  that  in</span><span>  commenting  on  any  occurrence  not</span><span>  purely  religious,  but  forced  into  con</span><span>  tact  with  it,  we  recognise  no  individu</span><span>  ality  save  that  of  the  movers,  and</span><span>  therefore  can  intend  no  offence.

Instead  of</span><span>  the  most  careful  scrutiny  injuriug  the</span><span>  well-behaved  immigrants,  it  would  be</span><span>  the  surest  means  of  raising  them  above</span><span>  calumny  —  to  which  they  would*  be</span><span>  open,  if  the  Government  continued  to</span><span>  hold  insufficient  and  unsatisfactory</span><span>  Star  (Thamber  enquiries.  It  is  due  to</span><span>  every  immigrant  setting  foot  on  pur</span><span>  shores,  that,  they  should  not  be  made  to</span><span>  suffer  for  the  wrongs  done  by  othersfand</span><span>  the  only  way  to  relieve  them  is  by  plac</span><span>  ing  guilt  on  the  proper  shoulders  in  the</span><span>  most  public  manner.  The  argumcuVnf</span><span>  Mr.  Hjobbbx  for  being  ssont  on  these</span><span>  cases  of  immorality,  has  about  as  macu</span><span>  soundness  as  the  generality  of  his  argu</span><span>  ments  where  the  little  reason  he  has  is</span><span>  blinded  by  his  self-will.  It  is  a  similar</span><span>  argument  to  that  used  forconfining  steer</span><span>  age  passengers  to  one  firm  of  shippers  ;</span><span>  for  the  necessity  of  the  present  scheme  of</span><span>  Emigration,  because  the  Government</span><span>  had  not  sufficient  financial  knowledge  to</span><span>  maintain  the  value  of  the  {and  orders,</span><span>  under  the  older  and  better  system  ;  or</span><span>  for  throwing  up  the  present  scheme</span><span>  because  Messrs.

If  it  be  charity  to</span><span>  allow  the  many  to  suffer  for  the  acts  of</span><span>  the  few,  by  leaving  tbe  imputations  in</span><span>  doubt,  then  we  say  save  us  from  being</span><span>  tbe  objects  ot  such  charity,  and  we</span></p> <p><span>  believe  every  honost  and  moral  immi</span><span>  grant  will  join  us  in  the  supplication.</span><span>  But  although  Mr.  Herbert's  pretext</span><span>  for  secrecy  might  bHad  strangers  or</span><span>  persons  at  a  distance,  all  who  judge</span><span>  him  fairly  will  assign  to  a  far  different</span><span>  motive  thau  charity  towards  the  immi</span><span>  grants.  He  knew  he  was  responsible</span><span>  for  the  present  scheme,  and  he  feared  to</span><span>  meet  the  consequences  of  its  mismanage</span><span>  ment.  Every  immigrant,  coming  in  any</span><span>  of  tbe  ships  complained  of,</span><span>  investigation  as  theiest  means  of  re</span><span>  taining  it  ;  while  the  greatest  kindness</span><span>  that  can  be  done  them  by  the  commu</span><span>  nity  is  to  give  a  hearty  support  to  their</span><span>  demand.</span><span>  Let  us  compare  the  Emigration  of</span><span>  Messrs.  Herbert  and  Jordan  with  that</span><span>  of  tbe  Emigration  Society,  they  so  viru</span><span>  lently  assailed  and  treated  so  unjustly.</span><span>  A  dispute  about  a  land  order  and  tbe</span><span>  receipt  of  a  gratuity  were  the  most</span><span>  serious  charges  they  could  bring  agaiust</span><span>  it.  The  ships  of  the  same  firm,  be  it</span><span>  remembered,  were  used  by  that  society,</span><span>  but  under  proper  management  ;  there</span><span>  was  do  complaint  of  Doctor  or  Officers,</span><span>  or  of  any  immorality  in  ship  after</span><span>  ship.  The  Government  and  their</span><span>  agents  were  bo  enamoured  of  die  scheme</span><span>  of  the  Queensland  Emigration  Society,</span><span>  that  they  determined  to  steal  it;  but,</span><span>  like  all  stolen  property,  it  has  done  very</span><span>  little  good  to  those  who  possessed  them</span><span>  selves  of  it.  Their  failure,  however,  is</span><span>  ?uo  reproach  to  the  system  ;  it  was</span><span>  worked  successfully  in  tbe  outset,  aud</span><span>  mav  be  so  again,  under  proper  care.</span><span>  To  forego  a  scheme  that  answers  the</span><span>  circumstances  of  the  colony,  and  saves</span><span>  us  from  running  into  debt  for  popula</span><span>  tion,  because  a  few  incapableshad  failed</span><span>  to  work  it  fairly,  would  be  downright</span><span>  folly  and  feebleness.</span><span>  No  rther  conclusion  can  be  drawn</span><span>  from  the  interview  of  tbe  deputation</span><span>  with  Mr.  Hebbebx  than  that,  while  re</span><span>  luctantly  acknowledging  his  capability</span><span>  to  perform  the  duties  which  he  has  un</span><span>  dertaken  withrespeotto  emigration,  he</span><span>  has  resolved  to  cloak  his  inability  be</span><span>  hind  his  official  position.

'</span><span>  The  coarse  that  England  will  adopt,</span><span>  in  case  Snssia  obstinately  persists  in</span><span>  refusing  to  accept  of  the  amicable  in</span><span>  tervention  of  the  Great  Powers,  most</span><span>  materially  affects  the  ultimate  solution</span><span>  of  the  difficulty.

But</span><span>  it  seems  tenable  that  the  true  policy  of</span><span>  England  in  this  difficult  complication</span><span>  would  |be  to  maintain  a  cautious  neu</span><span>  trality,  'leaving  to  France  and  Austria</span><span>  the  task  of  enforcing  upon  Russia  the</span><span>  views  of  the  three  Great  Powers.</span><span>  Should,  -france  and  Austria  alone</span><span>  undertake  an  armed  intervention  in</span><span>  favor  of  the  Poles,  the  non-participation</span><span>  of  England  in  the  struggle  would  afford</span><span>  a  feasible  basis  of  arrangement,  what</span><span>  ever  might  be  tbe  final  result  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  impending  war.  ''he  actual  fighting  is</span><span>  a  secondary  feature  of  modern  warfare,</span><span>  of  for  less  importance  than  the  ultimate</span><span>  pacification.

After</span><span>  the  fight  liad  ragsd  to  that  pitch,</span><span>  when  the  most  pugnaciously  disposed</span><span>  begin,  to  find  the  »ork  of  mutual</span><span>  destruction  a  'tiresoile  game,  then</span><span>  might  '.the  British  libn  step  in,  and</span><span>  W&  m.itfiftegjhmaivab  psbohisw  npa</span><span>  peace.

Ever  in  his  congenial</span><span>  element,  when  engaged  in  bigoted</span><span>  suggestion  or  in  striving  to  arouse  sec</span><span>  tarian  ill-will  and  uncharitableness,  he</span><span>  appears  to  exist  and  subsist  by  vile</span><span>  attacks  on  those  who  differ  from  him  in</span><span>  religion  or  politics.  No  pretexf  is  too</span><span>  slight  which  can  afford  .  him  an  oppor</span><span>  tunity  of  returning  to  his  favorite</span><span>  theme;  and,  no  assertion  is  sufficiently</span><span>  untruthful  or  improbable  to  be  beneath</span><span>  his  use,  if  it  be  calculated  to  produce'</span><span>  the  desired  object  of  his  wretched  and</span><span>  unenviable  existence  —  sectarian  ani</span><span>  mosity  between  Protestant  and</span><span>  Catholic.</span><span>  The  last  effusion  opens  with  a  mild</span><span>  reproof  to  the  Government  for  vague</span><span>  ness  in  their  mode  of  describing  the</span><span>  laud  which  they  offer  for  sale.  But  as</span><span>  tbe  public  are  well  aware,  the  blame  of</span><span>  Government  from  that  quarter  is  a</span><span>  mere  blind  to  cloak  an  attack  on  Roman</span><span>  Catholics.  The  true  object  of  the  ar</span><span>  ticle  is  an  endeavor  to  enlist  religious</span><span>  intolerance  in  a  competition  for  a  few</span><span>  town  allotments  required  by  the  Roman</span><span>  Catholics  on  which  to  erect  a  Convent</span><span>  and  Schools  in  connection  with  their</span><span>  Church.  We  are  very  far  from  thinking</span><span>  so  meanly  of  the  people  of  Ipswich  as</span><span>  to  believe,  that  any  bnt  a  handful  of</span><span>  bigots  like  himself,  would  be  led  to  act</span></p> <p><span>  upon  bis  spiteful  suggestion.  But  the</span><span>  principle  and  tolerant  spirit  of  the  great</span><span>  bulk  of  the  community  —  which  he  libels</span><span>  by  the  bare  supposition  that  they  would</span><span>  degrade  themselves  by  becoming  the</span><span>  took}  of  bis  design  —  affords  no  palliation</span><span>  for  his  bitter  and  contemptible  ani</span><span>  mosity.</span><span>  Was  it  not  that  a  consideration  for</span><span>  the  peace  and  welfare  of  society  claims</span><span>  the  exposure  and  reprobation  of  hypo</span><span>  crites,  who  pander  to  the  vilest  passions</span></p> <p><span>  of  humanity  under  the  guise  of  religion,</span><span>  we  should  turn  away  with  contempt  and</span><span>  sickened  disgust,  from  a  production</span><span>  conceived  in  uncharitableness,  and</span><span>  breathing  throughout  its  entire  length</span><span>  a  spirit  directly  opposed  to  the  teach</span><span>  ings  of  Christianity,  of  toleration,  aud</span><span>  of  honor.  But  enough  of  the  effects</span><span>  produced  by  such  instructors,  en  the</span><span>  miuds  of  the  young  aud  the  uneducated,</span><span>  are  to  be'traced  in  the  history  of  social</span><span>  commotions,  to  induce  every  liberal</span><span>  minded  man,  no  matter  what  his  creed</span><span>  may  be,  to  use  his  influence  to  destroy</span><span>  their  impression  on  a.  siew  suid  paaoefn!</span><span>  society.  In  that  light,  and  in  that</span><span>  light  only,  do  we  regard  them,  or</span><span>  deem  them  worthy  of  our  notice  or  con</span><span>  sideration.</span><span>  The  Catholics  of  Ipswich  some  ten</span><span>  months  since,  asked  the  Secretary  for</span><span>  Lauds  and  Works  to  grant  them  a  piece</span><span>  of  ground  adjoiuing  the  allotment  on</span><span>  which  their  Church  is  built,  whereon</span><span>  to  erect  a  Convent  aud  Orphanage.</span><span>  The  request  was  made  on  account  of</span><span>  the  charitable  purpose  to  which  a  por</span><span>  tion  of  the  buildings  was  -to  be  devoted.</span><span>  But  the  request  having  been  refused,</span><span>  on.the  plea  that  the  law  would  not  -per-</span><span>  mit  of  the  grant  being  :  made,  the'</span><span>  Catholics  expressed  their  wish  to  have</span><span>  the  land  offered  for  sale,  so  that  they</span><span>  might  purchase  it  and  carry  out.  their</span><span>  intention.  It  was  understood  that</span><span>  every  facility  would  be  afforded  to  them</span><span>  for  doing  so,  and  there  the  matter</span><span>  rested.  until  the  land  was</span><span>  advertised  for  sale  in  two  rood</span><span>  lots.  As  it  was  '  believed  that  it</span><span>  would  neither  'be  a  breach  of  law,  nor</span><span>  any  great  concession  from  the</span><span>  Government  to  ask  that  the  land  re</span><span>  quired  for  the  object  should  be  sold  in</span><span>  one  block  it  was  requested  that  it</span><span>  should  be  withdrawn  from  sale  until  the</span><span>  request  had  been  made  to  the  Execu</span><span>  tive.  The  land  is  again,  however,  ad</span><span>  vertised  for  sale  in  the  usual-sized  town</span><span>  lots,  and  our  contemporary  fearing  that</span><span>  the  publicity  given  to  its  sale  in  the</span><span>  Government  Gazette  and  in  his  own</span><span>  advertising  columns,  would  not  be  BufE</span><span>  dent  to  prevent  the  Catholics  from  ob</span><span>  taining  it  for  the  required  purpose,  at</span><span>  something  near  the  minimum  .'price;</span><span>  uses  his  leading  columns  and  tries  to</span><span>  work  on  the  bigotry  and  cupidity  of</span><span>  land  speculators,  in  order  to  truaUjuta</span><span>  (be  object  of  the  Catholics  or  failing</span><span>  ?«Ma  feiotopel  them  to  pay  the  high</span><span>  est  price-for  the  land.</span><span>  Little  more  is  needed  than  a  bare</span><span>  relation  of  the  facts,  to  induce  every</span><span>  right-minded  man  to  look  upon  the</span><span>  journal  that  could  pursue  «uoh  a  oourse</span><span>  with  contempt  and  suspicion.

'</span></p> <p><span>  The  Ipswich  Municipal  Council  have  t</span><span>  juoicionily  rescinoed  the  illegal  vote</span><span>  for  the  purchase  of  a  Corporation  J</span><span>  6gtolaYthi£  in  the  Grammar  School.  1</span><span>  Tte  discassion  on  the  rescission  of  the</span><span>  motion  touched  on  most  of  the  argu</span><span>  ments  pro  and  con,  and  elicited  frum</span><span>  its  mover  as  able  a  defence  as  could  be</span><span>  made  for  it.  Alderman  Chubb  failed</span><span>  in  showing  any  clause  in  the  Munici</span><span>  palities  Act  giving  power,  to  make  such</span><span>  a  grant  ;  the  provisions  in  relation  to</span><span>  gardens  and  public  libraries,  have  so</span><span>  analogy  to  the  patronage  of  an  educa</span><span>  tional  establishment  which  one-half  of</span><span>  the  ratepayers  do  riot  approve  of.  It  is</span><span>  to  be  regretted  that  Alderman  Chubb</span><span>  hosjaet  the  just  disapproval  of  the  vote</span><span>  in  an  angry  spirit,  few  who  know  him</span><span>  would  assign  his  action  in  the  first  in</span><span>  stance  to  any  sectarian  or  political</span><span>  motive,  and  even  the  attempt  to  defend</span><span>  his  former  action  might  admit  of  ex</span><span>  case  ;  but  the  proposal  to  carry  the</span><span>  illegal  grant  in  another  form,  and  to</span><span>  interfere  with  a  highly  useful,  legal</span><span>  provision  from  a  feeline  of  chagrin,  is</span><span>  conduct  we  should  not  have  expected</span><span>  from  a  gentleman  of  his  liberal  and</span><span>  enlightened  views.</span><span>  .  '''Seeing  that,  however  good  might  be</span><span>  the  motive  of  his  original  action,</span><span>  frwn&tmpalatabltiuto  a,  large  section  oF</span><span>  the  ratepayers,  as  well  asan  unwarrant</span><span>  able  stretch  of  the  law,  the  dignified</span><span>  course  would  have  been  to  have  ad</span><span>  mitted  the  error  and  let  the  matter</span><span>  drop.  We  should  not  think  he  covets</span><span>  the  position  of  champion  to  a  faction</span><span>  which,  Uy  annoy  those  who  differ  from</span></p> <p><span>  it,  would  willingly  sustain  any  illegal</span><span>  proceeding;  but  bis  recent  notices  of</span><span>  motion  Are  certainly  susceptible  -rf  such</span><span>  an  interpretation.  Mr.  Chubb  is  well</span><span>  aware  that  the  72nd  clause  of  the</span><span>  Municipal  Act,  which  empowers  the</span><span>  Council  to  make  bye-laws  'for  the  pre</span><span>  vention  and  extinguishing  of  fires,'</span><span>  vests  in.  them  the  authority  to  provide</span><span>  the  required  apparatus  for  carrying</span><span>  such  bye-laws  into  effect  So  that  the</span><span>  onlyobjection  to  the  vote  for  a  fire  engine</span><span>  applies  more*  to  the  point  when  the</span><span>  vote  should  be  made  —  whether  before</span><span>  or  after  the  passage  of  the  bye-law  —</span><span>  and  not  to  the  legality  of  the  appropri</span><span>  ation  of  the  ifands  to  such  a  purpose.</span><span>  The  entire  of  the  arguments  on  Coun</span><span>  cil  expenditure  in  carrying  out  its</span><span>  functions,  are  met  in  the  same  way  ;  the</span><span>  necessity  for  the  outlay  being  directly</span><span>  implied  by  the  powers  and  functions  of</span><span>  the  .Council.  An  Alderman  may  cause</span><span>  labor  and,  it  may  be,  injury,  by  plans</span><span>  able  but  unsound  objections,  because</span><span>  some  motiou  of  bis  own,  clearly  illegal,</span><span>  has  been  rejected  or  resciuded  ;  but</span><span>  such  conduct,  whatever  may  be  its</span><span>  more  immediate  result,  will  not  tend  to</span><span>  raise  him  in  the  estimation  of  the  body</span><span>  of  ratepayers.</span><span>  The  endowment  of  a  Grammar</span><span>  School,  is  evidently  an  appropriation  of</span><span>  Municipal  funds,  which  the  framers  of</span><span>  the  Act  uevcr  contemplated;  it  is  not</span><span>  the  amount  of  the  graut  that  con</span><span>  stitutes,  the  illegality,  but  the  grant</span></p> <p><span>  itself,  ?wtretoer  it  »-e  tot  a  'pmxmi  tjr</span><span>  a  hundred.  Alderman  Chubb  is  too</span><span>  good  a  lawyer  to  be  ignorant  of  that</span><span>  fact  j  let  him  review  what  he  has  done</span><span>  in  connection  with  this  scholarship,</span><span>  and  he  will  probably  arrive  at  the  con</span><span>  clusion,  that  he  has  done  enough  to</span><span>  establish  his  appreciation  of  the  Gram</span><span>  mar  School,  which  he  would  make  the</span><span>  ratepayers  endow  did  the  law  permit  ;</span><span>  but  as  the  latter  important  requisite  to</span><span>  the  act  does  not  exist,  the  supporters</span><span>  of  the  School  must  take  the  will  for  the</span><span>  deed.  In  return  for  his  favor,  they</span><span>  certainly  do:  not  require  him  to  make</span><span>  himself  obstructive  to  such  measures</span><span>  of  general  utility  as  the  provision  of</span><span>  the  requisite  material  for  extinguishing</span><span>  fires,  or,  if  they  do,  they  are  most  tin</span><span>  Just  and  ungrateful.</span><span>  For  the  share  we  have  taken  in  op</span><span>  posing  the  illegal  expenditure  of  Mu</span><span>  uicipal  funds,  we  are  quite  content  to</span><span>  take  the  censure  of  the  organ  of  bigotry</span><span>  aud  illiberality  in  Ipswich  as  the  high</span><span>  est  compliment  which  could  be  paid</span><span>  us.  Any  advocacy  meeting  abuse  in</span><span>  that  quarter,  may  fairly  be  taken  as</span><span>  reasonable  sad  liberal.

In  this</span><span>  sense  we  accept  it,  as  quite  distinct  and</span><span>  apart  from  the  proceedings  of  the  Mu</span><span>  nicipal  Council,  as  a  sort  of  '  honorable</span><span>  mention'  than  which  there  could  be  no</span><span>  greater  praise.</span><span>  ?  ;  ?  ?»  ?</span><span>  Tog  possibility  of  the  invasion  of</span><span>  British  India  by  the  Tzar,  either  alone</span><span>  or  in  league  with  some  other  potentate,</span><span>  oiana.

Few  will  credit  that  any</span><span>  intelligent  Protestant,  much  less  a</span><span>  Catholic,  would  patronise  a  publica</span><span>  tion  that  displayed  such  uncompromis</span><span>  ing  ill-will  to  any  section  of  the  com</span><span>  munity.  Talk  of  intelligent  Catholics</span><span>  bciug  on  the  subscription-lUt  of  a  paper</span><span>  which  fixes  its  emissary  at  their  very</span><span>  altar  to  misreport  their  Bishop  and  ac</span><span>  cuse  him  of  robbery,  which  assailed  the</span><span>  immigration  of  their  countrymen  and</span><span>  co-relgionists,  which  tried  to  magnify</span><span>  differences  aud  put  false  constructions</span><span>  on  the  proceedings  of  their  churches,</span><span>  which  raised  a  cry  against  their  hold</span><span>  ing  office  in  the  Municipal  Council  and</span><span>  originated  a  society  to  keep  them  out  of</span></p> <p><span>  position  iu  either  Municipality  or  Par</span><span>  itatnent,  irblcb  wo'uia  deprive  them  of</span><span>  any  but  a  godless  education,  and  which</span><span>  would  ruu  the  land  sharks  into  com</span><span>  petition  with  them  in  the  purchase  of  a</span><span>  piece  of  ground  on  which  to  erect  an</span><span>  asylum  for  their  orphans  and</span><span>  schools  for  their  children.  If</span><span>  there  are  Roman  Catholics  who</span><span>  subscribe  to  such  a  journal,  we  can  only</span><span>  observe  that  they  aud  our  contemporary</span><span>  are  well  fitted  to  keep  couipaay  and</span><span>  we  wish  them  a  long  career  of  mutual</span><span>  regard.</span><span>  Our  offences  in  the  eyes  of  our  con</span><span>  temporary  are  in  reality  only  two,</span><span>  whatever  he  may  state  to  the  contrary.</span><span>  Oue  of  these  is  that  we  have  principles</span><span>  which  we  honestly  announce  and  fear</span><span>  lessly  adhere  to  ;  which  are  in  their</span><span>  truthfulness  and  general  acceptance  too</span><span>  wide  and  sound  to  be  injured  by  his</span><span>  puny  assaults.  We  ask  freedom  of</span><span>  opinion  for  every  man  and  are  as  ready</span><span>  to  defend  the  rights  of  the  Protestant,</span><span>  or  Jew,  as  those  of  the  Catholic  ;  or  of</span><span>  the  Scotchman  as  the  Irishman.  Let</span><span>  him  assail  any  of  them  unjustly  and  we</span><span>  will  prove  the  truth  of  our</span><span>  assertion.  So  broad  a  policy  is</span><span>  not  to  his  liking,  for  as  he</span><span>  reckons  so  large  a  number  of  intelli</span><span>  gent  Catholics  on  his  subscription  list,</span><span>  he  would  like  to  have  a  monopoly  of</span><span>  thejir  country  and  creed  to  assail  and</span><span>  trample  on  it  at  will-  He  accuses  us</span><span>  of  being  a  supporter  of  forgery,  because</span><span>  in  reply  to  an  article  of  his  on  the  3rd</span><span>  instant,  we  could  uot  go  to  the  extent</span><span>  of  tbe  criminality  with  which  he</span><span>  charged  them,  and  inferred  from  the</span><span>  loose  way  in  which  he  put  the  charge</span><span>  that  lie  was  ridiculiug  their  want  of</span><span>  education,  not  charging  them  with  the</span><span>  crime  of  forgery.  He  is  not  content</span><span>  that  he  should  be  misunderstood,  and</span><span>  cause  we  thought  he  alluded  to  igno</span><span>  rance  and  not  crime.  Hear  that,</span><span>  intelligent  Catholic  subscribers  !</span><span>  We  unmasked  one  of  bis  most  evi</span><span>  dent  and  bitter  attacks,  written  with</span><span>  the  view  of  depriving  the  Catholics  of</span><span>  a  site  for  their  Orphanage  and  Convent</span><span>  or  making  them  pay  the  Jiighest  market</span><span>  price  for  it  ;  charging  them  at  the  same</span><span>  tune  with  forgery  and  speaking  in  well</span><span>  understood  terms  to  bigotry  and  cupi</span><span>  dity.  He  knows  he  has  not  a  single</span><span>  justification,  still  he  smarts  and  fears</span><span>  for  his  Catholic  subscription  list.</span><span>  How  is  be  to  satisfy  both  sides  ?  Await</span><span>  some  other  opportunity,  .and  by  jamb</span><span>  ling  up  detached  sentences  from  differ</span><span>  ent  articles  attempt  a  make-believe</span><span>  .reply.  That  he  lias  miserably  tailed</span><span>  in  doing  more  than  placing  himself</span><span>  in  a  greater  dilemma  most  be  dear</span><span>  to  everyone  of  his  readers.  He  suo</span><span>  eeeds  in  proving  to  bis  Catholic  sub</span><span>  scribers  that  the?  or  their  coreligion</span><span>  ists  are  capajblc  of  forgery,  and  that</span><span>  their  clergymen  are  tyranta,  who  will</span><span>  not  let  item  send  thejr  ^children  to  a</span><span>  ybtid  -Gratnmar  School.

As  he  liiw  a  mission,  to  assail</span><span>  'priests,  parsons,  or  ministers,'  but</span><span>  more  especially  the  first;  so  we  have  a</span><span>  mission  to  unmask  and  Btigmntise</span><span>  bigotry  and  false  assumption  wherever</span><span>  we  discover  them.  It  is  in  furtherance</span><span>  of  that  mission  that  we  notice</span><span>  his  attacks  on  the  Catholics,  other</span><span>  wise  we  should  allow  them  to  pass</span><span>  unheeded.  But  as  every  time  he  gives</span><span>  utterance  to  his  narrow  views  regarding</span><span>  this  body  or  on  political  questions  in</span><span>  which  they  are  interested,  he  affords  us</span><span>  an  opportunity  of  advocating  a  more</span><span>  liberal  and  Christian  policy  and  a</span><span>  more  equitable  settlement  of  questions</span><span>  affecting  the  education  and  morality</span><span>  of  the  people.

Sut  it  is  to  be</span><span>  observed  that  this  extraordinary  circum</span><span>  stance  in  the  Customs'  returns  is  not  so</span><span>  frequent  as  to  justify  us  in  assuming</span><span>  that  the  habit  o%  increased  tippling  is</span><span>  characteristic  of  ar  settled  population.</span><span>  We  believe  that  '  e  have  not  retrograded</span><span>  in  onr  general  standard  of  morality</span><span>  during  the  last  twelve,  months.

"<p><span>  SATURDAY,  SEPTEMBER  26,  1863.</span></p> <p><span>  In  another  place  in  our  columns  will</span><span>  be  found  tbe  repor;  of  the  Academic</span><span>  fete,  which  was  duly  celebrated  at  Ips</span><span>  wich  on  yesterday.  ?  In  ordinary  cir</span><span>  cumstances,  an  eve  at  of  such  a  nature,</span><span>  arising  out  of  a  well  devised  plan  of</span><span>  affording  increas*!  facilities  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  education  of  our  cfilomal  youth,  would</span><span>  have  evoked  our  'warmest  sympathies</span><span>  and  met  our  unqualified  approbation.</span><span>  The  due  and  becoriing  education  of  the</span><span>  rising  generation  'is  one  of  the  most</span><span>  imperative  duties  o'f  the  generation  that</span><span>  is  passing  away  front  the  scene  of  life.</span><span>  By  a  fctrict  attention  to  tbe  fulfilment</span><span>  of  this  doty,  the)  present  generation</span><span>  acquits  itself  towards  that  which  fol</span><span>  lows  it  of  the  obligation  which  itself</span><span>  had  contracted  towards  that  which  pre</span><span>  ceded  it.  Thus  its  place  in  the  pro</span><span>  gressive  march  of  humanity  has  been</span><span>  usefully  filled,  and  its  action  within</span><span>  the  sphere  of  life  lias  not  been  without  a</span><span>  beneficial  influenc's  upon  the  human</span><span>  race.  Hence  ir±  all  rationally  cMsti</span><span>  tuted  societies,  where  tits  responsibility</span><span>  of  human  existemje  and  its  neoessary</span><span>  consequence,  perpetuation,  has  been</span><span>  rightly  understood,  the  rearing  of  the</span><span>  youth  has  always  formed  a  most</span><span>  marked  and  important  feature  of  their</span><span>  organization  and  an  unerring  criterion</span><span>  of  their  enlightenment  and  civilization.</span><span>  A  state  of  society  where  die  brute</span><span>  instinct  of  perp  nation  should  alone</span><span>  prevail,  undignif  id  and  unezalted  by</span><span>  the  enobling  Be  timent  of  parental  re</span><span>  jponsibilitj,  wo  Id  be  justly  stigma</span><span>  tized  as  the  most  sorrupt  and  depraved</span><span>  condition  of  hu;  tan  degradation.  So</span><span>  that  it  may  com  tly  be  laid  down  that</span><span>  it  isthesentimei  t  of  parental  responsi</span><span>  bility  which  constitutes  the  basis  of</span><span>  of  ftmily,  social,  and  political  life.</span><span>  Vow,  if  this  sentiment  of  paternal  re</span><span>  sponsibility  be  tho  indispensable  ground</span><span>  work  of  the  triple  status  of  the  rational</span><span>  existence  of  man,  it  is  plain  that  any</span><span>  attempt  which  would  tend  to  impair  or</span><span>  diminish  it  is  alike  pernicious  to  family</span><span>  life,  to  society,  and  to  the  body  politic</span><span>  or  State.  -  Hence,  in  pronouncing  upon</span><span>  the  merit  of  any  system  of  education,  it</span><span>  is  necessary  before  all  to  determine</span><span>  whether  due  regard  has  been  had,  in</span><span>  its  conception  and  application,  to  the</span><span>  responsibility  of  the  parent.  And</span><span>  wherever  such  responsibility  has  been</span><span>  totally  or  partially  ignored  or  unduly</span><span>  coerced,  or  even  influenced  unwar</span><span>  rantably,  it  is  plain  that  every  such</span><span>  attempt  to  interfere  with  the'  funda</span><span>  mental  principle  of  rational  life  is  con</span><span>  demnable  in  sound  morality.  Since,</span><span>  moreover,  the  force  and  extent</span><span>  of  paternal  responsibility  must  de^</span><span>  pend  upon  the  judgment,  duly</span><span>  and  conscientiously  guided,  '.  :of</span><span>  the  parent  hinself,  it  is  apparent</span><span>  that  a  system  of  Education  which,  in</span><span>  the  case  of  a  certain  class  of  parents</span><span>  may  nave  nothing  condemnable  would</span><span>  be  altogether  demoralizing  with  refer-</span><span>  ence  to  another  class.  And  this  brings</span><span>  us  from  ethics  to  matter  of  fact</span><span>  We  have  said,  that  under  ordinary  cir</span><span>  rumstances  we  would  heartily  rejoice  at</span></p> <p><span>  an  event  such  as  Oat  which  came  off</span><span>  yesterday  in  Ipswich.  We  mean  thereby</span><span>  that,  if  this  Government  Grammar</span><span>  School  were  established  upon  the</span><span>  ordinary  principle  of  regard  for  parental</span><span>  responsibility,  we  could  have  no  manner</span><span>  of  reason  for  not  according  to  it  our</span><span>  unlimited  approval  and  support;  but</span><span>  when  we  reflect  that  the  principle  upon</span><span>  which  this  school,  with  others  similar,</span><span>  is  now  sought  to  be  founded  in  our</span><span>  midst,  directly  tends  to  set  aside</span><span>  parental  responsibility.,  we  feel  bound</span><span>  to  withhold  from  it  that  approbation</span><span>  which  educational  establishments,</span><span>  founded  upon  sound  moral  principles,</span><span>  are  in  every  way  entitled  to.  With  a</span><span>  numerous  class  of  the  parents  for  whose</span><span>  children  thir  system  of  Education  is</span><span>  being  established,  to  avail  themselves</span><span>  of  the  teaching  it  offers  would  be  to</span><span>  ignore  the  responsibility  that  rests  upon</span><span>  their  shoulders,  with  their  own</span><span>  full  conviction  of  its  weight</span><span>  and  reasonableness.  It  is  sum</span><span>  cient  that  those  parents,  unless  they</span><span>  do  violence  to  their  most  solemn  con-'</span><span>  victions,  be  forced  to  the  conclusion,</span><span>  themselves  responsible  to  secure  for</span><span>  their,  children  can  not.  be  obtained</span><span>  under  this  system.  Immediately  that</span><span>  sueh  is  the  case  —  immediately  that  the</span><span>  parent's  sentiment  of  responsibility</span><span>  takes  alarm  —  this  system,  however  ad</span><span>  missible  in  the  case  of  parents  who</span><span>  form  a  different  judgment  of  parental</span><span>  responsibility,  becomes  obnoxious,  be</span><span>  cause  demoralizing,  for  that  class  of</span><span>  parents  to  whom  we  allude.  Now  that</span><span>  such  a.  class  of  parents  exists  in  this</span><span>  colony,  and  that  they  form  a  large  ma</span><span>  jority  of  the  population,  there  can  be</span><span>  no  manner  of  doubt  whatsoever.</span><span>  Already  on  several  occasions  large  and</span><span>  influential  sections  of  the  community</span><span>  have  protested  that  they  can  not,  with</span><span>  out  doing  violence  to  their  conscientious</span><span>  convictions,  hold  themselves  thus  quit</span><span>  of  that  responsibility  which  the  con</span><span>  dition  of  parent,  according  to  their</span><span>  understanding  of  its  onns,  imposes  upon</span><span>  them.  They  have  declared  that  they</span><span>  can  approve  of  no  system  of  education</span><span>  which  is  not  based  upon  religion,  of</span><span>  which  religious  teaching  does  not  form</span><span>  an  important  and  inseparable  part.</span><span>  They  have  pronounced  it  to  be  their  con</span><span>  scientious  conviction  that  they  would</span><span>  be  wanting  in  the  tull  acquittal  of  their</span><span>  parental  responsibility  were  they  to  avail</span><span>  themselves  for  their  children  of  any  sys</span><span>  tem  of  Education  which  excluded  from</span><span>  the  school  that  first  and  all  important</span><span>  duty  of  both  parent  and  child,  prayer  ;</span><span>  which  banned  from  the  school,  lessons</span><span>  in  the  great  class-book  of  Christianity,</span><span>  the  Bible  5  which  deprived  the  child  of</span><span>  the  opportunity  and  advantage  of  being</span><span>  instructed  in  the  dogmas  of  religion,</span><span>  and  taught  to  fix  in  his  memory  the</span><span>  tenets  of  his  belief;  which  reared  up</span><span>  the  youthful  mind  in  an  unhealthy  at</span><span>  mosphere,  from  which  the  pnrifying  in</span><span>  the  sublime  principle  that  the  know</span><span>  ledge  of  the  Creator  is  before  all  know</span><span>  ledge,  and  practically  illustrate,  its</span><span>  transcendental  importance  by  giving</span><span>  priority  in  the  workshop  of  the  youth</span><span>  ful  mind  to  the  simple  lesson  of  the</span><span>  love  of  the  Creator  over  all  human</span><span>  learning.</span><span>  This  class  of  parents  can  never</span><span>  be  convinced  by  the  argument</span><span>  of  expediency,  which  is  propoun</span><span>  ded  by  the  advocates  of  tbe  present</span><span>  Government  System  of  Education.</span><span>  .This  class  of  parents  will  never  consent</span><span>  to  deprive  their  children  of  the  incal</span><span>  culable  advantages  which  a  system  of</span><span>  Education  based  upon  religion,  possesses</span><span>  in  their  estimation,  over  this  Non</span><span>  religious  State  System;  because,  fay  so</span><span>  doing,  they  would  be  reproached  by</span><span>  their  own  consciences  witb  not  bavins</span><span>  acquitted  themselves  'of  the  parental</span><span>  responsibility  that  rests  upon  them.</span><span>  Hence  it  is  impossible  for  this</span><span>  class  of  parent?  to  approve  of  '  the</span><span>  present  Government  system  of  Educa</span><span>  tion,  and  it  is  an  evident  injustice  to</span><span>  wards  them  to  essay  to  force  upon</span><span>  them  such  a  system.  Such  an  attempt</span><span>  assails  the  most  sacred  right  of  tbe</span><span>  subject  —  liberty  of  conscience.  A  per</span><span>  sistence  in  such  an  attempt  betrays  an</span><span>  iniquitous,  a  depraved,  and  demoralizing</span><span>  policy.</span><span>  True,  this  class  of  parents  are</span><span>  not  forced  to  send  their  children  to</span><span>  these  Government  Schools  ,  but  they</span><span>  are  not  the  less  obliged  by  law  to  pay</span><span>  for  a  system  of  Education  of  which  they</span><span>  cannot  conscientiously  avail  themselves</span><span>  for  their  children.  It  is  plain,  then,</span><span>  that  a  system  of  Education  which  is</span><span>  founded  upon  a  two-fold  injustice  tothe</span><span>  eonsaences  and  pockets  of  a  large  class</span><span>  of  the  parents  of  this  colony,  can  never</span><span>  ?fce^-Twwfflimaj^.^iwtfl^^</span><span>  midst.-  The  time  must  come  when-the</span><span>  public  mind  will  'take  a  just  and  rea</span><span>  sonable  view  of  this  grave  question.</span><span>  Then  another  system  of  State  Educa</span><span>  tion  will  be  inaugurated  in  this  colony,</span><span>  of  such  a  nature  as  that  all  classes  of</span><span>  parents  will  be  able  to  avail  themselves</span><span>  of  it,  lor  their  children,  in  the  lull  con</span><span>  viction  that,  in  so  doing,  they  are  not</span><span>  doing  violence  to  -tiwir  sentiment  '  of</span><span>  parental  responsibility.</span><span>  ??  ?  ,„?-  ??  .

Taking  tbe  litter  into  ac</span><span>  count,  we  may  be  excused  for  a  little  in</span><span>  credulity  oow  as  to  the  objest  of  the</span><span>  present  Brisbane  Registration  Associa</span><span>  tion.</span><span>  We  dtfeotjn  any  vray  desire  to  throw</span><span>  mra-iranr  oftws  action,  vre  suppose^</span><span>  for  we  are,  told  that  the  real  object  of</span><span>  those  who  originated  and  those  who</span><span>  continue  it  is,  to  place  upon  the  roll  of</span><span>  electors  all  who  ought  by  the  present</span><span>  electoral  system  to  be  there.  We  be</span><span>  lieve  this,  and  believing  it,  hint  with  '</span><span>  all  respect  that  a  little  more  publicity</span><span>  would  more  efficiently  serve  the  osten</span><span>  sible  purpose  than  the  present  apparent</span><span>  quietude.

The</span><span>  men  who  are  supposed  to  head  this</span><span>  movement  do,  by  this  sort  of  limitation,</span><span>  great  injustice  to  themselves  and  their</span><span>  intentions.</span><span>  We  suppose  that  the  real  object  of</span><span>  any  registration  society  must  necessarily</span><span>  be  the  placing  on  the  roll  all  persons</span><span>  entitled  to  vote,  wherever  they  may</span><span>  live,  or  whatever  may  be  their  avoca</span><span>  cation.'  It  may  farther  be  assumed</span><span>  that  the  greater  the  distance  of  the</span><span>  electoral  district  from  those  cities  (like</span><span>  Brisbane  for  instance)  in  which  intelli</span><span>  gence  and  numbers  weigh,  the  greater</span><span>  the  necessity  for  an  active  and  intelli</span><span>  gent  electorate  or  registration  commit</span><span>  tee.

If  it  is</span><span>  necessary  to  increase  and  redistri</span><span>  bute  Representation  because  population</span><span>  has  increased,  it  is  equally  requisite</span><span>  that  tbe  whole  of  tbe  industrious  adult</span><span>  male  population  should  be  represented.</span><span>  Under  the  present  liw,  however  liberal</span><span>  it  may  appear,  there  is  a  large  number</span><span>  of  the  population  excluded  from  the</span><span>  franchise  :  all  pastoral,  agricultural,</span><span>  trade,  or  domestic  servants,  who  receive</span><span>  a  less  salary  than  £100  a  year,  and</span><span>  who  are  boarded  and  lodged  by  their</span><span>  employers,  cannot  in  the  terms  of  the</span><span>  law  claim  the  suffrage.

To</span><span>  argue  that  a  disability  of  this  descrip</span><span>  tion  should*  be  allowed  -to  continue,</span><span>  until  the  individuals  who  suffer  the</span><span>  disfranchi&eraent  raise  an  agitation  for</span><span>  its  repeal,  manifests  a  want  of  liberality</span><span>  and  principle  discreditable  to  a  states</span><span>  man,  and  dangerous  to  tbe  peace  of  a</span><span>  country.</span><span>  If  it  be  desirable  at  present</span><span>  to  interfere  with  the  representative</span><span>  and  electoral  Iaw6  of  the  colony,  the</span><span>  judicious  course  will  be  to  consider</span><span>  and  provide  for  every  existing  defect.</span><span>  There  are  examples  enough  of  the</span><span>  evils  prodnded  by  frequently  tinkering</span><span>  at  such  laws,  to  warn  an  Executive</span><span>  against  the  policy  of  following  them.</span><span>  Where  from  expediency  or  illiberality,</span><span>  consequence  is  an  agitation  hurtful  to</span><span>  industry  and  steady  progress,  terminat</span><span>  ing  in  hasty  and  ill-considered  legisla</span><span>  tion.

Better</span><span>  by  far  is  the  policy  which  having</span><span>  justly  and  dispassionately  consi</span><span>  dered  the  principle  on  which</span><span>  a  law  should  be  based,  proceeds  to  make</span><span>  the  whole  of  its  details  accord  with  the</span><span>  principle,  irrespective  of  every  consider</span><span>  ation  whether  this  or  that  feature  has</span><span>  been  agitated  for  ;  as  it  is  certain  that</span><span>  a  measure  the  details  of  which  but  par</span><span>  tially  complies  with  tbe  principle  on</span><span>  which  it  is  founded  will  sooner  or  later</span><span>  call  for  amendment  or  repeal.</span><span>  We  have  before  stated  that  manhood</span><span>  suffrage  —  when  applied  to  schemes  of</span><span>  representation,  where  limited  subdi</span><span>  vision  of  country  and  population  possess</span><span>  the  sole  elective  power  —  has  not  worked</span><span>  so  satisfactorily  as  those  could  have</span><span>  wished,  who  desired  that  every  man</span><span>  should  have  a  voice  in  tbe  election  of</span><span>  the  representatives  who  made  the  laws</span><span>  he  was  bound  to  obey.  We  have  also</span><span>  stated  our  belief  that  the  evil  was  not</span><span>  in  the  suffrage,  bat  in  die  systems  to</span><span>  which  it  was  applied,  which  possessed</span><span>  none  of  the  checks  required  to  meet</span><span>  an  excess  of  the  suffrage.  So  con</span><span>  vinced  are  we  that  manhood  suff</span><span>  rage  is  discordant  with  the  pre</span><span>  sent  schemes  of  representation  that</span><span>  although  we  look  on  it  as  absolutely</span><span>  essential  to  true  representative  Govern</span><span>  ment,  so  long  as  the  system  of  narrow</span><span>  representation  exists,  we  would  look</span><span>  upon  its  introduction  as  an  evil  rather</span><span>  than  a  good  ;  because  we  foresee  that</span><span>  every  abuse  that  could  arise  would  be</span><span>  blamed  on  the  6uflrage  and  not  on  the</span><span>  defective  scheme  of  representation  to</span><span>  which  it  would  be  attached,  ?  „,,  ?  ,  ?  n,  .—</span><span>  filled  the  principle  that  the  representa</span><span>  tives  were  in  feet  tbe  elect  of  the  ma</span><span>  jority  of  the  body  of  electors  for  whom</span><span>  they  made  laws,  tbe  evils  of  the  de</span><span>  mocratic  and  levelling  tendencies  of</span><span>  manhood  suffrage  which  are  produced</span><span>  when  the  principle  is  applied  to  a  sys</span><span>  tem  of  electoral  subdivisions,  would  be</span><span>  adequately  checked.

"<p><span>  TUESDAY,  SEPTEMBER  15,  1863.</span></p> <p><span>  The  report,  purporting  to  be,  of  ""  the</span><span>  ""  Select  Committee  appointed  to  inquire</span><span>  ""  into  and  report  on  the  operation</span><span>  ''  and  working  of  the  Immigration  laws,</span><span>  ""  and  the  legality  and  effect  of  the  regu-</span><span>  ""  lations  affecting  same,  which  have  from</span><span>  ""  time  to  time  been  issued  by  the</span></p> <p><span>  ""  Government,""  is,  in  many  respects,  an</span><span>  exceedingly  perplexing  document.</span><span>  For  not  only  does  the  evidence  disclose</span><span>  directly  opposite  statements  from  quar-</span><span>  ters  whence  such  opposition  might</span><span>  reasonably  have  been  expected,  but</span><span>  between  persons  who  might  be  sup-</span><span>  posed  to  live  together  in  that  harmony</span><span>  which  official  companionship  engenders.</span><span>  There  is  a  discord  for  which  it  is  not</span><span>  easy  to  account.  And  the  report  itself</span><span>  differs  from  most  parliamentary  reports</span><span>  of  the  kind,  in  that,  we  are  left  in  total</span><span>  ignorance  of  the  proceedings  of  the</span><span>  Committee  itself.  As  respects  its</span><span>  dealing  with  the  facts  upon  which  it</span><span>  came  to  the  conclusion  it  sets  forth.</span><span>  Had  it  not  been  for  the  refusal  of  the</span><span>  Chairman  of  the  Committee,  Mr.  RAFF,</span></p> <p><span>  to  follow  the  usual  course,  and  move</span><span>  the  adopion  of  the  report  by  the  As-</span><span>  sembly,  we  should  not  have  been  aware</span><span>  that  anything  but  the  utmost  union  pre-</span><span>  vailed  in  the  Committee,  or  that  their</span><span>  conduct  had  not  been  guided  by  a  com-</span><span>  men  concurrence  towards  a  common  end.</span><span>  But  the  extraordinary  circumstance</span><span>  that  Mr.  HERBERT—one  of  the  parties</span><span>  inculpated  by  the  demand  for  the  ap-</span><span>  pointment  of  any  such  Committee—</span><span>  and  not  Mr.  RAFF  its  Chairman,  comes</span><span>  before  the  House  as  its  patron  and  advo-</span><span>  cate,  coupled  with  the  total  absence  in</span><span>  the  document  laid  on  the  table  of  the</span><span>  Assembly  of  the  usual  record  of  debate</span><span>  and  division  in  the  Committee  itself,</span><span>  leads  us  to  view  the  whole  matter  as</span><span>  open  to  the  gravest  possible  suspicion.</span><span>  There  is  more  mystery  in  this  report</span><span>  than  we  like  and  we  shall</span><span>  apply  ourselves  to  such  consideration  of  the  evidence  taken,  as  the  time  will</span><span>  allow.  And  we  do  this  that  the  public</span><span>  may  be  aware  of  the  magnitude  of  the</span><span>  questions  involved,  and  of  the  probable</span><span>  causes  which  led  to  the  Ministerial  de-</span><span>  sire,  if  not  to  shirk  discussion,  at  least</span><span>  to  hide  all  traces  of  its  existence  in  the</span><span>  Committee,  and  consequently  of  those</span><span>  points  upon  which  such  disagreement</span><span>  having  occurred,  the  attention  of  the</span><span>  Assembly  would  be  very  naturally  con-</span><span>  centrated.</span><span>  It  is  no  secret  and  no  novelty,  that</span><span>  the  conduct  of  the  Government  in</span><span>  affecting  to  carry  out  the  law  relating</span><span>  to  Immigration  has  been  from  time  to</span><span>  time  attacked  as  illegal,  unjust,  and  in</span><span>  a  degree  liable  to  the  imputation  of  be-</span><span>  ing  corrupt.  Upon  the  two  former  of</span><span>  those  accusations  Mr.  HERBERT  was</span><span>  directly  examined—upon  the  latter  the</span><span>  evidence  affords  curious  indications</span><span>  apart  from  his  examination.  We  shall</span><span>  take  the  two  points  illegality  and</span><span>  injustice  first.</span><span>  It  will  be  in  the  recollection  of  our</span><span>  readers  that  the  20th  clause  of  the  Act,</span><span>  24  Victoria,  No.  15,  provides  that  land</span><span>  orders  shall  be  given  to  persons  coming</span><span>  from  Europe  to  this  colony,  provided</span><span>  that  they  conform  to  the  regulations</span><span>  issued  by  the  Government  in  pursuance</span><span>  of  the  power  given  to  them  by  that</span><span>  Act.  These  land  orders  were  to  be  for</span><span>  £18  each  to  the  immigrant  on  arrival,</span><span>  and  for  £12  each  further  on  his  stay  in</span><span>  the  colony  for  two  years.  The  question</span><span>  then  arises  whether,  the  Government</span><span>  practically  suspended  the  issue  of  the</span><span>  second  land  order,  and  limited  that  of</span><span>  the  first  by  restricting  the  kind  and</span><span>  number  of  persons  coming  from</span><span>  Europe  its  conduct  was  legal.  That</span><span>  must  be  determined  by  a  consideration</span><span>  of  the  powers,  of  the  Executive  with</span><span>  reference  to  Acts  of  the  Legislature—</span><span>  and  no  amount  of  sophistry  will  be</span><span>  able  to  evade  the  conclusion  which  that  consideration  irresistably  enforces.</span><span>  When  an  Act  of  Parliament  declares</span></p> <p><span>  in  plain  language,  that  certain  things</span><span>  shall  be  done  and  enables  an  Executive</span><span>  to  make  further  regulations  for  more</span><span>  effectually  doing  them,  it  is  absurd  to</span><span>  say  that  those  regulations  may  override</span><span>  the  directions  they  were  limited  to  ex-</span><span>  plaining  and  carrying  into  effect.  It</span><span>  is,therefore,  inconsistent  with  common</span><span>  sense  to  say  that  a  government  has</span><span>  power,  by  a  regulation  earned  under  an</span><span>  Act  expressly  declaring  that  two  land</span><span>  orders  shall  be  given  to  immigrants,  to</span><span>  on  the  contrary  affirm  that  such  immi-</span><span>  grants  shall  only  have  one.  Again,</span><span>  when  an  Act  of  Parliament  embodies  a</span><span>  declaration  of  the  purposes  for  which  it</span><span>  is  passed,  and  amongst  these  has  one</span><span>  express  limitation  of  the  class  of  persons</span><span>  intended  to  be  benefitted  by  the  opera-</span><span>  tion  and  no  others,  it  is  again  inconsis-</span><span>  tent  with  common  sense  to  affirm  that</span><span>  a  government  acts  in  conformity  with</span><span>  the  provisions  or  purposes  of  the  act  by</span><span>  enforcing  limitations  not  included  with-</span><span>  in  the  Act  itself.  If  we  test  the  con-</span><span>  duct  of  the  Government  by  these  incon-</span><span>  trovertible  propositions  we  shall  find  it</span><span>  grossly  illegal,  and  on  the  face  of  it,  un-</span><span>  just.  The  Act  we  have  quoted  directs</span></p> <p><span>  two  land  orders  to  be  given.  The</span><span>  Ministry,  in  order  to  carry  tbat  into</span><span>  effect,  says  only  one  shall  be  gtanted.</span><span>  TKe  law  limits  the  issue  of  land  orders''</span><span>  to  immigrants,  'coming  from  Europe,</span><span>  without  distinction  otherwise  of  country</span><span>  or  creed.  The  GovemmentEay  that  im</span><span>  migrants  from  Ireland  shall  not  come</span><span>  nere  beyond  a.  proportion  derived  from</span><span>  the  relative  numbers  of  English,  Scot</span><span>  tish,  and  Irish  population  at  home.  If</span><span>  this  be  legal,  it  is  odd  law,—  law  not  to</span><span>  be  paralleled  in  any  court  or  any  legis</span><span>  lature  in  the  world,  where  the  dictates</span><span>  of  common  sense  and  common  honesty</span><span>  prevails  i.^If,  indeed,  this  government,</span><span>  or  any  government,  are  to  be  entitled  to</span><span>  declare  their  jpwn  view  of  the  powers</span><span>  and  intentionl%f  the  Legislatare,  and</span><span>  to  act  upon  that  view  without  fRm'bling</span><span>  themselves  to  consult  the  iSpiffion</span><span>  of  that  Legislature,  then  ?par-</span><span>  liamentary  government  is  a  very</span><span>  wretched  force.  The  report  of</span><span>  tjhis  Committee,  however,  dispenses</span><span>  with  all  reasoning  j  and,  indeed,  with</span><span>  OlfOOBisbuicy.  li  its  eleventh  clause</span><span>  the  'fulejuiggested  by  the  Govern</span><span>  ment'  (in  wtioh  that  exception  forms  a</span><span>  cardinal  point)  'is,  your  Committee</span><span>  think,  the  best  that  can  be  adopted.'</span><span>  But  what  is  more  absurd,  still,  the  Com</span><span>  mittee  do  -actually  condemn  the  conduct</span><span>  of  the  Government,  by  -suggesting  in</span><span>  their  concluding  recommendation,  that</span><span>  the  20th  clause  of  the  Alienation  of</span><span>  Crown  Lands  Act  should  be  repealed</span><span>  'to  make  it  lawful  for  the  Govern</span><span>  ment;'—  ^to  do  what?  'Why,  what  they</span><span>  Eire  and  have  .  for  some  time  past  been</span><span>  practically  doing,  —  to  limit  the  issue  of</span><span>  land  orders  to  Bteerage  passengers  to</span><span>  £18,  and  to  give  thirty-acre  land  grants</span><span>  to  immigrants  coming  in  intermediate</span><span>  and  first  class  cabins.  If  the  conduct</span><span>  of  the  Government  in  either  of  these</span><span>  respects  has  been  legal,  why  alter  the</span><span>  law  ?  But  if  the  law  must  be  altered</span><span>  that  conduct  has  been  illegal.  We</span><span>  submit  that  the  functions  of  Govern</span><span>  ment  do  not  include  the  commission  of</span><span>  illegality,  or  of  the  Legislature  the</span><span>  ieliberate  sanction  of  it  when  com</span><span>  mitted.</span><span>  It  is  impossible  for  any  one  to  read</span><span>  the  evidefte  of  Mr.  Hekbeet  and  not</span><span>  to  discover  the  animus  he  felt  towards</span><span>  the  Queensland  Immigration  Society,</span><span>  toirarde  its  patron,  the  Right  Reverend</span><span>  Dr.  Quinn,  and  towards  every  one  con</span><span>  nected  with  the  Society  or  its  opera</span><span>  tions.

We  -say  we  are  exceedingly</span><span>  anxious  to  direct  the  attention  of  the</span><span>  public  and  the  Assembly  to  one  great</span><span>  characteristic  of  the  Ministerial  plan</span><span>  now  recommended,  and  that  is  its  ine</span><span>  ritable  and  universal  tendency  to  the</span><span>  profit  of  Messrs.  Mackat,  Baines.  and</span><span>  Company  —  the  pets  of  Mr.  Henbx</span><span>  Jordan  —  at  the  expense  and  damage</span><span>  of  the  colony,  hut  with  the  greatest</span><span>  possible  facility  to  themselves.  And</span><span>  both  these  points  we  now  proceed  to</span><span>  prove.</span><span>  The  proposition  firstly  is,  that  Mr.</span><span>  Jordan  shall  grant  £18  land  orders  to</span><span>  the  shippers  of  immigrants,  which  could</span><span>  be  transferred  by  them  to  the  Govern</span><span>  ment  for  £16  cash.  Messrs.  Maceat,</span><span>  Baxnes  &  Co.  are  to  be  the  only  per</span><span>  sons  allowed  to  act  as  shippers.  In</span><span>  other  words,  Messrs.  .  Mackat,  Baines</span><span>  and  Co.,  are  to^be  paid  £16  in  cash  for</span><span>  every  immigrant  they  send  out.  Now,</span><span>  we  have  it  in  the  evidence  before  us  that</span><span>  Messrs.  Bright  Brothers  &  Co.  are  ',</span><span>  now  bringing  immigrants  to  Melbourne  ;'</span><span>  for  £13  19s.  5d.  per  statute  adult,</span><span>  while  another  firm  of  high  respecta</span><span>  bility,  Messrs.  Fet,  Davidson  -fc  Co.  are</span><span>  ready  to  bring  immigrants  here  for</span><span>  £14  per  head.  Take  the  last  as  a  fair  ,</span><span>  price  and  the  probable  immigration,  as</span><span>  stated  by  Mr.  Jordan,  at  10,000  per</span><span>  annum,  and  there  is  a  clear  nti»H  cash</span><span>  loss  to.  the  colony  of  £20,000,  which</span><span>  amount  goes  into  the  pocket  of  Messrs.</span><span>  Mackat,  Bathes  &  Co.  In  addition</span><span>  to  this,  they  are  to  receive  £3  per  head</span><span>  from  each  passenger,  to  compensate</span><span>  them  for  the  ordinary  charges  to  which</span><span>  shippers  are  liable.  This  would.make</span><span>  another  £30,000  per  annum.

Bat  we  shall  not  on  that</span></p> <p><span>  account  imitate  the  periodical  statistic</span><span>  jubilation  which  is  won*  10  be  poored</span><span>  forth  for  -par  delight,  -and  ascribe  all</span><span>  onjr~|progre8S  to  the'  tWBrgy  ,'  and  wisdom</span><span>  of  his  '  Excellency's  government.  .  The</span><span>  progress  we  may  &$Ay  allonr  ;  ihat  it</span><span>  has  been  what  it  might,  and  most  in</span><span>  disputably  ought  to  have  been,  we  may</span><span>  as  safely  deny.  What  we  have  done</span><span>  lias  been  Tather  in  spite  of  than  at  tbe</span><span>  instahoe  or  by  the  exertions  of  that</span><span>  Government  —  ?  Gpvernment  distui</span><span>  gnished  principally  by  the  'Utmost  eer</span><span>  'vility  of  oopyism,  combined  with  »n</span><span>  That  the  oonntry  has  advanced,  we  iure</span><span>  ,giad  to'  concede  ;  bat  oar  concession  can</span><span>  go  no  farther.  There  is  a  progress  in</span><span>  spite  of  impediment.  -  Oar  Government</span><span>  has  been,  the  great  obstacle  to  every</span><span>  thing  in  ^  way  «f  real  improvement.  .</span><span>  Great  praise  has  been  given  it  for  tbe</span><span>  initiation  of  the  land-order  system—  for</span><span>  to  that  syetem  we  owe  the  iinmigradon</span><span>  Which  has  been  'the  grand  source  -tf  all</span><span>  oar  prosperity.  'To  admit  this  fiwtiB</span><span>  ito  ^^  proclaim  'their  inoonaiBteney.  IF</span><span>  the  land  order  were  really  the  valnabie</span><span>  agent  described,  with  what  grace  pan</span><span>  the  GoTOraroftnt  daim  on  the,  gne</span><span>  hand  praisk&r  its  introduction,  aid  m*</span><span>  *b»  «tlwr  foe  their  ua-^i.ham</span></p> <p><span>  crippled  its  utility  br  deteriorating  its</span><span>  valae  and  availability.  If  Immigra</span><span>  tion  is  tbe  blessing  ttt  have  all  found</span><span>  it,  and  the  land  order  tbe  most  effective</span><span>  a-*ent  in  its  promotion,  to  lessen  the</span><span>  ueuve  ralneof  the  agent  was  to  impede</span><span>  the  flow  of  those  benefits  it  was  created</span><span>  to  induce.  That  the  Government  bave</span><span>  done  their  best  to  destroy  the  ralno  uf</span><span>  the  land  order  no  one  can  doubt.  Their</span><span>  works  bear  testimony  to  their  inteatioor).</span><span>  la  this  case  then,  th?  Immigration,  ou</span><span>  which  we  congratulate  ourselves,  has</span><span>  resulted,  not  from  the  eflorts  --f  Go</span><span>  vernment  to  promote,  but  in  spite  of</span><span>  their  exertions  to  prevent  -it.  Immi</span><span>  gration  has,  indeed,  been  directed  to</span><span>  oar  shores,  but  neither  in  number  uor</span><span>  in  qoality  to  one  half  the  extent  that</span><span>  we  might  au4  ought  to  have  expe</span><span>  rienced.</span><span>  Oae  advantage  may,  however,  be</span><span>  fairly  ascribed  to  the  present  adminis</span><span>  tration.  On  the  10th  December,  1859,</span><span>  the  then  population  forgot  their  sepa</span><span>  rate  nationalities,  in  their  joy  at  having</span><span>  achieved  a  distinct  political  existence</span><span>  —  they  were  all  Queeuslanders  We  owe</span><span>  it  to  the  Hebbebt  Government  that</span><span>  the  Irishman,  and  above  ail  the  Irish</span><span>  Catholic,  is  the  pariah  of  Legislative</span></p> <p><span>  concern  ;  and  that  a  feeling  of  national</span><span>  dislike  and  distrust  once  fast  4yu*K</span><span>  away,  basagaiu  assumed  an  undeniable</span><span>  existence  in  our  midst.  On  this  10th  day</span><span>  of  December,  8G3,  we  turn  our  eyes</span><span>  backward  ;  we  review  'the  march  of</span><span>  events;  and  we  find  recorded  in  the</span><span>  reports  of  Parliament,  in  natnberieR?</span><span>  official  documents,  in  deliberate  ex</span><span>  pression  and  unguarded  exclamation,</span><span>  that  the  introduction  of  the  Irush</span><span>  element  into  this  colonv  beyond  the</span><span>  proportion  that  may  be  deduced  from  a</span><span>  reference  to  the  fluctuating  population</span><span>  of  the  home  c-untry,  will  be  determin</span><span>  ately  opposed  by  the  Government  of</span><span>  which  Mr.  Herbert  is  the  head  He</span><span>  is  to  be  at  once  tbe  leader  of  political</span><span>  movement,  the  apostle  of  economic</span><span>  ratios,  and  the  grand  conservator  of  in</span><span>  tolerant  bigotry  in  Queensland.  Was</span><span>  ever  a  colony  so  carefully  watched</span><span>  over?  It  may  be  that  the  result  of</span><span>  such  sedulous  fostering  is  to  damage</span><span>  our  own  country,  and  inflict  incalculable</span><span>  wrong  upon  the  people  of  Great  Britain</span><span>  and  Ireland  ;  but  what  does  that</span><span>  matter?  Is  it  not  just  possible  that</span><span>  the  great  bulk  of  the  new  comers</span><span>  might  not  place  implicit  faith  in  the</span><span>  Government,  which  finds  comfort  in</span><span>  official  despatches  and  self-imposed</span><span>  laudation  i  In  that  case,  why  bring</span><span>  more  Irishmen  ;  indeed,  so  far  as  that</span><span>  is  concerned,  why  bring  anybody  ?</span><span>  And  on  the  lOtli  December,  1859,</span><span>  the  colour  was  tolerably  united.  There</span><span>  were  some  little  bickerings  about  the</span><span>  site  of  a  capital,  bat  had  anything  like</span><span>  justice  beeu.donc,  those  would  have</span><span>  been  silenced  by  the  voice  of  a  reason</span></p> <p><span>  able  gratulitioa.  Ou  this  10th  Decem</span><span>  ber,  1863,  all  the  disputes  that  ever</span><span>  rankled  amongst  as  are  abroad</span><span>  iu  tenfold  bitterness.  Prom  the</span><span>  Mary  to  Port  Denison  there  iB  one</span><span>  unceasing  clamour  against  the  into</span><span>  ISgayg%itf^'a'rf  Tfe&SK'feky?'</span><span>  If  we  find  ourselves  sorrowful  iy  com</span><span>  pelled  to  admit  that  there  is  some  pro</span><span>  bability  of  a  disruption  in  fonn  as</span><span>  well  as  in  troth,  —  that  at  this  moment</span><span>  the  voice  ot  the  great  mass  of  oar</span><span>  Northern  brethren  is  for  separation  —</span><span>  we  owe  it  to  our  progressive  govern</span><span>  ment.  They  have  cheated,  deluded,</span><span>  goaded,  and  insulted  the  penple  of</span><span>  the  North,  in  liko  manner  us</span><span>  they  have  cheated  and  insulted</span><span>  Brisbane  :  and  now  we  are  about  to</span><span>  reap  the  harvest  of  their  exertions  in</span><span>  that  distrust  and  disiike  which  separate</span><span>  communities,  as  well  as  individuals,  and</span><span>  with  like  evil  results  to  both.  If  we</span><span>  bave  prospered  in  spite  of  this  disunion,</span><span>  they  by  whom  that  disunion  wa$  caused</span><span>  can  surely  claim  little  hand  in  the  pro</span><span>  motion  of  our  prosperity.</span><span>  It  is  a  common,  and  we  do  not  doubt</span><span>  to  some  estc.it,  a  jost  remark,  that  the</span><span>  Parliament  we  now  have  will  not  bear</span><span>  comparison  in  ability  or  in  directness  -jf</span><span>  purpose  to  that  which  met  immedi</span><span>  ately  after  Separation.  But  what  is</span><span>  more  mournful  still  is,  that  the  very</span><span>  name  of  political  honesty  seems  to  have</span><span>  dwindled  out  of  fashion,  and  political</span><span>  principle  has  became  something  to  be</span><span>  supposed,  batnot  to  be  met  with  in  any</span></p> <p><span>  thing  approaching  a  tangible  shape.</span><span>  Had  our  government  beeu  entrusted  in</span><span>  the  first  instance  to  men  of  common</span><span>  sense  notions,  as  to  political  honesty,</span><span>  we  might  have  fared  better,  snd</span><span>  could  not  have  fared  worse.</span><span>  Bat  we  owe  to  Mr.  Herbert</span><span>  and  his  colleagues  tbe  most  unblusu</span><span>  ing  system  of  audacity  and  corruption</span><span>  that  has  been  yet  seen,  in  any  colony—</span><span>  as  bad  a  system  as  has  found  root  in</span><span>  anycountry  or  undei  any  circamstances.</span><span>  From  the  buying  off  the  patriots  who</span><span>  formed  tbe  Opposition  of  Jane,  1861,</span><span>  to  the  purchase  of  the  last  police  ma</span><span>  gistrate,  who  being  liberal  to  the</span><span>  beart's  core,  left  his  liberality  to  nestle</span><span>  there  in  sight  of  a.  billet—  -whether  the</span><span>  impudent  coalition  of  Mr.  Haoausteb</span><span>  with  the  Government  '  he  'had  more  than</span><span>  once  loaded  with  opprobrium,  be  con</span><span>  sidered  the  greatest  or  the  junc</span><span>  tion  of  Dr.  -Jhilmnob  the  meanest  '</span><span>  instance—  there  .has  been  daring</span><span>  the  four  years  of  our  present  Govern</span><span>  itnent,  J-ne  unceasing  cumulative  course</span><span>  of  puttie  worruption.  By  menace  snd</span><span>  by  cajolery,  by-open  purchase  and  by</span><span>  secret  bribe-  Whatever  art  was  wort</span><span>  Mnb/«Bed  or  most  certainly  effective—</span><span>  opposition  has  been  silenced  and  sup</span><span>  port  secured.  Ana  this  flagitioas  dis</span><span>  honesty  has  grown  to  be  admired,</span><span>  quoted,  and  when  possible  imitated.</span><span>  We  do  not  suppose  it  possible  to  find  in</span><span>  airy  'history  more  direct  instances  Of</span><span>  opeo^and  nnrecanted  falsehood  -on  the</span><span>  part  of  Government,  and  morenibeisble</span><span>  acqaiesjnence  in  it  on  the  part  of  a  people,</span><span>  than  are  to  be  found  mwrded  inths</span><span>  recants  of  Queensland.  Happily  the</span><span>  time  is  approaching  when  these  things</span><span>  shall  find  their  due  appreciation,  when</span><span>  wejBhall  bejMmpelled  to  wonder  at  tbe</span><span>  &Urju^«ruahiaIttywenow  endare.</span><span>  '*-'  YfHj  Rppantttiin  ftsfl  brought  ub  great</span><span>  U^wBBk  So  '  ttff  '  fUniitfj  vtn&  ttwir</span></p> <p><span>  sycophants  it  has  brought  substantial</span><span>  blessings.  In  this  we  see  no  causa  to</span><span>  be  thankful,  however  odd  oar  unsym</span><span>  pathising  nature  may  seem.  For  what</span><span>  real  good  .we  have  experienced,  we</span><span>  thank,  under  Providence,  ourselves  j  as</span><span>  for  them  the  greatest  title  they  could'</span><span>  possibly  earn  to  the  gratitude  of  tbe</span><span>  colony-  would  be  to  take  themselves  and</span><span>  their  doctrines  as  quick  as  possible  from</span><span>  oar  shores.  The  10th  of  December,</span><span>  1864,  may  afford  us  some  hope  of  such</span><span>  an  event.  Should  it  occur  then  we</span><span>  shall  have  double  cause  to  commemo?</span><span>  rate  the  Day  of  Separation.  *  -</span><span>  The  effect  of  the  lately  proclaimed'</span><span>  Emigration  Regulations^  and  of  the</span><span>  scheme  concocted  by  Messrs.  Hebbeet</span><span>  and  Jordan  in  London,  on  emigration</span><span>  from  the  continent  of  Europe,  is  calcu</span><span>  lated  to  do  considerable  evil  to  the</span><span>  colony.  Emigration  from  Europe,  if</span><span>  we  omit  the  British  Empire,  is  now</span><span>  virtually  at  an  end.  True,  the  handful</span><span>  of  Germans  who  are  at  present  iu  the</span><span>  colony  are  to  enjoy  the  privilege  of</span><span>  bringing  ont  their  relations  on  like</span><span>  terms  to  those  afforded  to  the  people</span><span>  of  Great  Britain.  But  let  any  rational</span></p> <p><span>  man  endeavor  to  realise  the  dimensions</span><span>  of  soil  available  for*  purposes  of  profit</span><span>  able  .culture  within  the  bounds  of  the</span><span>  -colony,  of  Queensland,  its  varieties  of</span><span>  climate,  its  natural  resources  in</span><span>  minerals,  in  woods,  and  in  vegetation,</span><span>  and  its  accessibility  to  the  great</span><span>  thoroughfare  of  nations;  and  6ay,  if  it</span><span>  is  jot  a  crime  against  humanity  in</span><span>  general  and  (ogainst  the  best  interests</span><span>  of  this  young  colony  in  particular,  to</span><span>  raise  up  obstacles  to  its  speedy  and</span><span>  permanent  settlement  with  that  skill</span><span>  snd  labor  for  which  it  languishes  and</span><span>  yearns.  ?</span><span>  Could  the  men  who  compose  the</span><span>  present  Government  and  legislators  of</span><span>  the  country  raise  themselves  superior</span><span>  to  the  petty  schemes  and  sympathies</span><span>  whicn  give  existence  to  their  narrow</span><span>  policy,  eo  that  they  might  see  in  the</span><span>  future  the  action  of  the  great  social</span><span>  development  which  they  are  ignorantly</span><span>  lending  their  puay  endeavours  to</span><span>  impede,  they  would  relax  their</span><span>  efforts  in  consternation,  when  im</span><span>  bued  with  a  just  perception  of</span><span>  their  own  insignificance,  and  their</span><span>  utter  inability  to  do  more  than</span><span>  momentarily  interfere  with  the</span><span>  designs  of  a  benevolent  Providence,  in</span><span>  providing  this  fertile  Jand  as  a  resource</span><span>  and  an  asylum  for  the  ill-fed  and  over</span><span>  crowded  peoples  of  the  nations  of  the</span><span>  Old  World.

We  have  J-een</span><span>  solicitous  to  hear  the  opinions  and</span><span>  arguments  of  honorable  members,  and</span><span>  pained  by  their  -.poverty  of  thought,</span><span>  .lapgnage.  and  :infor£aation.  ffiAy  the</span><span>  legislation,  of  the  fine  principles  of</span><span>  government,  and  of  the  history  and</span><span>  theory  of  the  constitution  ace  to  be  .con</span><span>  sidered  essential  qnalifioationE^^t  would</span><span>  not  be  easy  to  find  any  body  of  twenty</span><span>  six  commonly  educated  men  less  deserv</span><span>  ing  our  respect  The  discussionurereof</span><span>  the  spirit  and  elevation  which  might  rea</span><span>  sonably  be  supposed  to  belong  to  the</span><span>  smallest  of  parish  vestries  —  unredeemed</span><span>  by  humour  —  unenlightened  by  research.</span><span>  As  to  a  Parliamentary  Opposition,  and</span><span>  the  achievements  which  we  were  told</span><span>  to  expect  from  its  exertions,  the  thing</span><span>  very  soon,  became  a,  shadow  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  puniest  dimensions.  It  had  no  coher</span><span>  ency  of  principle,  and  little  of  action,</span><span>  and,  as  a  body,  was  great  only  in  the</span><span>  extreme  littleness  of  the  opinions  it</span><span>  enunciated  and  the  feebleness  it  dis</span><span>  played  in*  dealing  with  the  questions</span><span>  -that  came  before  it  Constitutional</span><span>  principles  and  policy  of  procedure  were</span><span>  forgotten  for  mere  quibbles  as  to  the</span><span>  smallest  dotails.  Tbe  grave  question  as</span><span>  to  the  right  of  any  Executive  to  inter</span></p> <p><span>  fere  with  and  virtually  suspend  the</span><span>  operation  if  an  existing  law  was  post</span><span>  poned  forj  tbe  consideration  of  what</span><span>  profit  might  have  been  made  by  the</span><span>  Queensland  Immigration  Society.  And</span><span>  the  propriety  of  suspending  any  large</span><span>  expenditure  in  Railway  works  until  a</span><span>  full  and  satisfactory  enquiry  had  been</span><span>  instituted  into  all  the  requirements  of</span><span>  the  schema,  was  a  matter  scarce  worth</span><span>  considering  when  Parliament  had  sanc</span><span>  tioned  the  mere  initiation  of  tbe</span><span>  scheme.  .Whether  further  money  was</span><span>  or  was  not  to  be  wasted  —  whether  an</span><span>  Executive  notorious  for  its  determined</span><span>  self  interpretation  of  the  law  to  suit  .</span><span>  its  own  purposes,,  was  to  be  left  with  a  '</span><span>  loan  admittedly  beyond  itsrequiremenle,  ,</span><span>  seems  to  have  been  a  question  of  less  -</span><span>  Executive  should  not  be  tied  in  its  ad</span><span>  ministrative  action—  just  as  if  the</span><span>  whole  Janctions  of  Parliamentary</span><span>  vitality  (light  not  to  be  concentrated</span><span>  on  that  jpery  point.  Altogether  the</span><span>  Opposition  cut  a  very  sorry  figure  —  nor</span><span>  perhaps  considering  all  the  circumstan</span><span>  ces  was  it  much  to  be  wondered  at  If</span></p> <p><span>  it  had  no  real  bond  of  principle  —  so</span><span>  vital  spark  of  party  —  the  defect  may</span><span>  have  sprung  from  the  very  cause  of  its</span><span>  birth.  Its  leader  asd  organiser  repre</span><span>  sented  nothing  but  a  personal  griev</span><span>  ance,  and.  left  to  himself,  had  really  very</span><span>  little  poli;jr  to  lay  down  save  that  of  op</span><span>  position  flbr  opposition's  sake.

Two  sentiments,</span><span>  moreover,  which  have  ever  found  a  j</span><span>  throne  in  the  British  heart  —  humanity</span><span>  and  liberty  —  are  grossly  outraged  in  the</span><span>  present  European  crisis,  while  a  prudent</span><span>  regard  for  self-interest  and  the  natural</span><span>  impulse  of  a  great  people  to  take  part</span><span>  in  all  that  occurs  of  a  nature  to  shed</span><span>  new  lustre  upon  the  glories  of  its  past,</span><span>  are  super-added  as  all-powerful  reasons</span><span>  wherefore  the  British  Nation  cannot</span><span>  r  tand  aloof  and  look  on  with  an  indif</span><span>  ferent  eye  at  the  grand  and  important</span><span>  events  now  being  enacted  in  the  political</span><span>  arena  of  Europe.</span><span>  But  while,  *in  the  actual  European</span><span>  crisis,  indifference  and  inaction  are  un</span><span>  worthy  the  enlightened  policy,  repug</span><span>  nant  to  the  humane  sentiment,  and</span><span>  incompatible  with  the  honorable  ambi</span><span>  tion  of  the  British  Nation,  the  course  to</span><span>  be  followed  is  sodifficultto  be  determined,</span><span>  owing  to  the  immense  complications  of</span><span>  tbe  question  at  issue,  that  the  most  dis</span><span>  tinguished  statesmen  of  the  country  are</span><span>  at  variance,  and  their  counsels  aremarked</span><span>  by  perplexity  and  indecinon.

Looking  beyond  the  actual  ques</span><span>  tion  of  armed  intervention  in  favour</span><span>  of  the  Poles,  he  canvassed  tbe  results  of</span><span>  the  success  of  such  a  measure,  and</span></p> <p><span>  plainly  showed  that  the  real  difficulty</span><span>  would  only  begin  after  the  armed  in</span><span>  tervention  of  the  Great  Powers  .had</span><span>  been  crowned  with  success.  And</span><span>  wherefore  1  Because,  says  Earl</span><span>  RTJ66BLL,</span><span>  '  When  yon  are  told  that  a  war</span><span>  on  behalf  of  Poland  wonia  be  jnsti</span><span>  fiable,  the  question  arises,  what</span><span>  is  Poland?  There  is  a  Poland  of  the</span><span>  Treaty  of  Vienna,  really  defined,  in  regard</span><span>  to  which  die  Powers  of  Europe  have  certain</span><span>  rights  of  interference  or  remonstrance,</span><span>  Bnt  that  is  not  the  Poland  which  is  looked</span><span>  toby  tho«e  who  are  urging  a  war  on  its  be-  !</span><span>  halt  So  far  is  this  from-being  so  that  from</span><span>  the  very  beginning  of  this  agitation,  when  I</span><span>  Count  Zamoyski  made  his  representation  to</span><span>  the  Emperor  of  Bussia,  the  claim  liaa  been</span><span>  that  the  ancient  lungaom  of  Poland  should</span><span>  be  restored,  and  that  kingdom  is  to  consist</span><span>  of  tbe  various  countries  and  province!  in</span><span>  which  any  great  number  of  Poles  are  to  be</span><span>  found.  I  say,  *  any  great  number  of  Poles,'</span><span>  because  there  are  some  of  these  provinces</span><span>  claimed1  by  Poles  in  which  the  Poles  are</span><span>  clearly  not  in  a  majority.  (Hear,  hear.)</span><span>  Then,  If  we  look  aVttie  matter  historically,</span><span>  we  find  that  the  Poles  who  have  been  rising</span><span>  in  insurrection,  or-vho  say  they  have  been</span><span>  driven  into  insurrection,  are  not  confined</span><span>  even  to  those  provinces  which  belonged  to</span><span>  Poland  in.1772.al  the  time  at  thefirstpartj</span><span>  tum.  As  yonrloFdshineananran.attempts</span><span>  at  insurrection  have  been  made  in  the</span><span>  Ukraine,  which  was  yielded  by  John  60</span><span>  bieski  sometime  in  1730..

It  is  a  vise  dispensation  of</span><span>  Providence  by  which  we  ana  impelled  to</span><span>  connect  men  vilh  the  proceedings  they</span><span>  initiate;  and  to  test  politicians  by  the</span><span>  honesty  of  their  schemes,  not  lesB  than</span><span>  by  the  fidelity  they  display  in  working</span><span>  them  out  If  ml  —  downright,  indis</span><span>  putable  eril  patent  to  all  who  an  not</span><span>  gifted  «ith  that  tnocal  obligrdty  which</span><span>  sees  nothing  fait  personal  interest—</span><span>  has  been  brought  into  jour  midst—  if  it</span><span>  oaniebyineans&rshMBgovenunBiit</span></p> <p><span>  is  itself,  of  itsj-wn  free  choice,  the  sole</span><span>  directors  and  controllers  —  it  will  not</span><span>  do  for  their  apologists  to  think  that</span><span>  they  can  palliate  the  mischief  by  at</span><span>  tributing  its  origin  to  causes  beyoflP</span><span>  the  reach  of  the  men  wbo  voluntarily</span><span>  made  themselves  the  absolute  dictators</span><span>  of  the  whole.  The  Government  have</span><span>  done  this  of  their  own  will,  with  a  zeal</span><span>  and  ardour  beyond  that  which  on  com</span><span>  mon  occasions  can  be  evoked  from  them.</span><span>  They  practically  destroyed  tbe  right  of</span><span>  free  immigration  —  they  made  the  whole</span><span>  system  dependent  upon  their  own  roles</span><span>  and  their  own  agent  —  they  allowed</span><span>  no  immigrant  asking  a  land  order</span><span>  to  have  even  tbe  right  of  claim</span><span>  ing  it  without  the  agent's  consent  ?</span><span>  they  limited  the  ships  employed</span><span>  to  the  ownership  of  one  firm,  at  a  price</span><span>  some  pounds  beyond  what  other  houses</span><span>  of  equal  weight  offered  to  charge  ;  and</span><span>  having  constituted  themselves  the  sole</span><span>  and  absolute  managers  of  our  Immi</span><span>  gration  system,  they  are  not  now  going,</span><span>  when  that  system  most  miserably  fails,</span><span>  to  evade  the  just  consequences  of  their</span><span>  own  acts.  Party,  indeed  !  Party—  to</span><span>  charge  men  who  bare  undertaken  a  task</span><span>  beyond  their  powers  with  the  failure</span><span>  that  fairly  belongs  to  them  !  If  this  be</span><span>  party;  may  ire  never  be  otherwise  than</span><span>  amongst  the  foremost  of  partisans.</span><span>  ?  The  whole  blame  of  Che  long  continu</span><span>  n  '  «_?  I  11  r  i  ?  is;  despotism  Which</span><span>  has  culminated  by  a  most  fit  wretched</span><span>  ness  of  vice  on  the  Sunda  and  the</span><span>  Bockhampton  —  that  vice  of  which</span><span>  these  vessels  are  not  the  only  instances  —</span><span>  may  be  traced  to  the  cowardice  or  the</span><span>  dishonesty  of  the  great  bulk  of  those</span><span>  who  have  assumed  to  take  the  lead  in</span><span>  exposing  it  We  must  not  meet  a  grow</span><span>  ing  evil  with  an  energy  and  persistency</span><span>  commensurate  with  its  own,  lest  we  are</span><span>  thought  too  thoroughly  identified  with</span><span>  party.  Wfi  may  admit  the  eril,  but</span><span>  we  must  not  denounce  the  causes,  lest</span><span>  that  be  personal  ;  and  when  at  last  the</span><span>  foundations  of  our  natural  prosperity  —</span><span>  the  preservation  of  domestic  honor,  and</span><span>  the  purity  of  our  own  homes  —  are</span><span>  menaced  by  an  inflood  of  licentiousness,</span><span>  which  startles  even  the  most  timid,  and</span><span>  retiring  into  something  like  exertion.</span><span>  We  are  told,  that  to  admit  the</span><span>  semblance  even  of  party  feeling  is  to</span><span>  prejudice  the  success  of  the</span><span>  effort.  We  are  to  .  condemn</span><span>  tbe  system  in  as  strong  terms  as  we</span><span>  choose,  but  most  not  venture  to  in</span><span>  fringe  the  privileges  of  'a  faint  respec</span><span>  tability  by  a  single  word  condemnatory</span><span>  of  those  to  whose  incompetence,  or  neg</span><span>  ligence,  or  ignorance,  or  even  corruption</span><span>  the  great  mass  of  the  mischief  is  due,</span><span>  Is  this  cowardice?  Is  it  ignorance  ?  Is</span><span>  it  dishonesty  ?</span><span>  For  what  is  the  real  history  of  the</span><span>  immigration  business?  In  the  first</span><span>  place,  the  Government  suppress  all  pri</span><span>  vate  combinations  for  the  introduction</span><span>  of  immigrants.  In  the  nest  place,</span><span>  they  concentrate  in  their  own  hands  the</span><span>  whole  machinery  of  immigration.  In  the</span><span>  last  place,  they  will  have  no  ships  but</span><span>  those  of  one  firm  —  that  firm  of  their</span><span>  own  chosing  —  in  which  immigrants  can</span><span>  come  here.  Now  in  doing  all  this  tbeyare</span><span>  Co  be  assumed  em  Icnovrtncj  what  dtxlleei</span><span>  they  imposed  upon  themselves,  and</span><span>  their  own  intention  or  capacity  to  per</span><span>  form  them.  If  they  were  able  to  do  all</span><span>  that  was  necessary  to  secure  a  health</span><span>  ful  flow  of  population  to  these  shores,</span><span>  how  is  it  that  the  wretched  licentious</span><span>  ness,  at  which  we  are  all  ashamed  and</span><span>  disgusted,  has  grown  and  multiplied</span><span>  most  since  the  Government  assumed</span><span>  their  self-imposed  functions.  Either</span><span>  they  could  or  could  not  have  prevented</span><span>  it.  If  they  could  we  can  find  no  terms</span><span>  strong  enough  in  which  to  condemn</span><span>  their  wickedness;  if  they  could  not,</span><span>  are  we  to  Bcreen  them  from  the  con</span><span>  sequences  of  their  own  incapacity  i</span><span>  The  suffering  to  the  com</span><span>  munity  is  plain  enough.  We</span><span>  are  giving  to  the  ?firm  of</span><span>  Mackat,  Baines,  and  Co.  a  monopoly</span><span>  of  shipping  —  we  are  giving  to  Mr.</span><span>  Jo&dan  a  monopoly  of  selection  —  we</span><span>  pay  Mackat,  Baines,  and  Co.  at  least</span><span>  £3  per  head  more  passage  money  than</span><span>  we  should  have  to  pay  were  immigra</span><span>  tion  left  to  take  its  own  course  —  we</span><span>  leave  the  Government  here  to  deal  in</span><span>  all  ways  as  they  think  fit  at  this  end  of</span><span>  the  line  with  the  conduct  of  their</span><span>  agents  at  the  other  —  and  we  have  a</span><span>  right  to  ask  them,  as  the  authors  and</span><span>  managers  of  the  scheme,  why.  we  pay  a</span><span>  higher  sum  than  any  other  Australian</span><span>  colony  only  to  get  a  worse  result.  Does</span><span>  Mr.  Jordan  Touch  for  the  honesty  and</span><span>  virtue  of  his  selections  ?  If  not,  why</span><span>  the  farce  of  committing  to  him</span><span>  that  selection,  on  the  ground  that</span><span>  only  by  it  can  those  qualifica</span><span>  tions  in  immigrants  be  secured.

Mackat,  Bainzs,  and  Go.</span><span>  assure  themselves  of  the  decency  and</span><span>  sobriety  oF  tbeir  captains  and  oBboers</span><span>  *re*»e~'&oTe&!5mng  a,  tody  of  Immi</span><span>  grants,  who  have  no  other  protectors,  to</span><span>  their  care?  If  they  do,  whence  the</span><span>  undisguised  vileness  of  the  Bockhamp</span><span>  ton,  and  tbe  more  specious  but  thinly</span><span>  veiled  practices  of  tbe  Sunda!  In</span><span>  what  respect  are  the  fruits  of  Messrs.</span><span>  Mackax,  Baines,  &  Co'fi  claims  so</span><span>  marked  as  to  entitle  them  to  tie  £3</span><span>  extra  for  which  Mr.  Jordah  so  strongly</span><span>  pleads.  If  we  ate  to  appraise  them  at</span><span>  their  real  value,  how  many  of  OB  are</span><span>  there  who  would  not  exclaim  in  grati</span><span>  tude  to  any  dispensation  that  got  rid  of</span><span>  the  shipowners  and  ships  together  ?</span><span>  No,  we  repeat  it,  let  us  have  a  truce</span><span>  to  this  sort  of  hypocrisy.  Heaven</span><span>  knows  the  number  of  respectable  tnne</span><span>  curiste  and  parasites  is  large  enough  to</span><span>  cover  a  decent  amount  of  iniquity,  bnt</span><span>  to  public  men,  properly  so-called,  the</span><span>  pathway  is  npen  and  clear.

To</span><span>  meet  these  objections,  Mr.  Geegort</span><span>  proposes  a  smaller  and  nearer  Jlesercoir,</span><span>  a  less  copious  stream  oftlwate.-,  and  a</span><span>  possible,  though  not  certain,  less  cost.</span><span>  We  in  no  way  sympathise  with  the</span><span>  objections,  and  fee  no  justification  for</span><span>  the  means  proposed  to  'meet  (hem.  On</span><span>  the  contrary,  we  shall  do  our  best  to</span><span>  show  that  the  first  are  futile  and</span><span>  the  second  not  only  supererogatory  but</span><span>  mischievous.  And,  moreover,  it  is  too</span><span>  late  now  to  take  such  a  grouml  The</span><span>  locality  of  the  proposed  works  or  reser</span><span>  voir  is  settled  by  the  Act  for  regu</span><span>  lating  the  water  supply,  passed  iu  the</span><span>  last  Session.  If  any  objection  existed</span><span>  when  that  Act  was  under  consideration</span><span>  it  should  have  been  made  then  —  if  it</span><span>  was  not  valid  then  it  is  not  valid  now.</span><span>  We  are  not  to  be  everlastingly  treated</span><span>  to  a  set  of  dissolving  views,  always</span><span>  shadowing  something  very  grand  in</span><span>  promise  and  fading  into  dim  nothing</span><span>  I  ness  in  performance.  What  the  Act</span><span>  promised,  the  good-fi»ith  of  the  colony</span><span>  demands  should  be  fulfilled—  neither</span></p> <p><span>  ]Ithioa  Creek  won't  do.  We  have</span><span>  nonght  to  do  with  it  ;  give  as  our  Bill</span><span>  ?  the  whole  Bill  —  and  nothing  but  the</span><span>  BilL  Anything  else  is  beside  the</span><span>  matter.</span><span>  But  if  the  Corporation  scheme  does</span><span>  contemplate  a  supply  beyond  our</span><span>  present  requirements,  we  regard  this  as</span><span>  a  merit  to  be  extolled  Dot  a  defect  to</span><span>  vitiate  their  plan.  While  we  are</span><span>  squabbling,  disputing,  and  planning,</span><span>  population  increases.  By  the  time  the</span><span>  works  are  complete,  we  may  look  to  our</span><span>  numbers  being  nearly  doubled.  Are  we</span><span>  every  four  years  to  run  about  for  fresh</span><span>  reservoirs  and  new  works—  to  behold  a</span><span>  continuous  and  self-renewing  stream</span><span>  of  Snnrevors,  Engineers,  Contractors,</span></p> <p><span>  Acts  of  Parliament,  Lawyers,  aria</span><span>  Loans  i  This  would  be  the  idea  of  a</span><span>  peddler  and  a  tinker  in  public  economy.</span><span>  The  loan,  if  we  recollect  rightly,  is  to</span><span>  be  payable  in  twenty-five  years.  Let</span><span>  the  snpply  which  the  loan  is  to  promise</span><span>  us  be  good  for  twenty-five  years</span><span>  too.  Less  than  that,  after</span><span>  taking  into  consideration  the  ordinary</span><span>  increase  of  population,  it  would  be  folly</span><span>  to  provide—  unless,  indeed,  the  local</span><span>  peculiarities  are  irresistibly  opposed  to</span><span>  the  provision.  And,  if  Mr.  Gregory's</span><span>  plan  is  based  upon  any  smaller  idea,</span><span>  the  sooner  he  deposits  it  in  the  archives</span><span>  of  his  oftice,  to  repose  with  other  re</span><span>  gistered  applications,  the  better.</span><span>  And  then  comes  the  question  of</span><span>  what  is  an  adequate  permanent  supply</span><span>  for  the  population  of  a  city  like  -Bris-</span><span>  bane.  We  are  to  remember  that  effec</span><span>  tive  sewerage  is  a  want  that  is^fast</span><span>  making  itself  known,  and  when  known</span><span>  i*  nf  a  kind  to  impress  its  lessons  upon</span></p> <p><span>  us  by  the  strong  hands  of  pestilence</span><span>  and  death.  We  cannot  have  efficient</span><span>  seneraco  without  a  constant  and  copi</span><span>  nature  of  our  levels  must  be  derived</span><span>  from  a  source  of  considerable  elevation,</span><span>  hence  we  are  inclined  to  believe  that</span><span>  an  average  supply  of  less  -than  100</span><span>  eallons  per  soul  daily  should  be  con</span><span>  templated  as  the  really  efficient  quan</span><span>  tity  and  50  gallons  the  minimum  com</span><span>  patible  with  health  and  cleanliness.</span><span>  Take  the  latter,  and  with  our  present</span><span>  population  we  should  have  some  400,000</span><span>  eallons  a  day  poured  into  oiur  houses</span><span>  i  Ind  streets.  Whether  Mr.  Gregory's</span><span>  plan  comes  up  to  this  we  do  not  now</span><span>  know,  but  if  it  does  not  we  should  an</span></p> <p><span>  hesitatingly  reject  it  ;  and  if  the  Cor</span><span>  poration  scheme  will  do  more,  it  is  eu</span><span>  titled  to  the  preference.  We  shall</span><span>  wait  to  see  the  official  reports  of  both</span><span>  (schemes,  when  we  may  compare  them</span><span>  with,  the  rates  of  supply  maintained</span><span>  elsewhere,  and  perhaps  draw  some  useful</span><span>  deductions.  More  especially  if,  as  we</span><span>  have  heard  it  rumoured,  Mr.  Gregory's</span><span>  notion  of  an  adequate  quantity  is  not</span><span>  equal  to  balf  50  gallons  per  ami  per</span><span>  ,  diem.,  ?</span><span>  -Bat.-tnislp6mng  the  comparative  ex</span></p> <p><span>  amination,  we  revert  to  the  mam  prin</span><span>  ciple  to  be  observed  in  this  matter,  and</span><span>  giatis,  the  provision  in  the  main  reser</span><span>  voir  of  the  very  largest  quantity  that</span><span>  can  be  got  ;  in  other  words,  availing  of</span><span>  that  water-shed  which  presents  the</span><span>  largest  effective  area.  There  appears</span><span>  to  be  no  dispute  that  the  Enoggera</span><span>  Creek  heads  give  the  most  available</span><span>  site,  keeping  this  consideration  in</span><span>  view,  within  many  miles  of  Brisbane.</span><span>  .Tn  that  case,  to  remove  the  reservoir  to</span><span>  a  much  smaller  one  would  be  a  wilful</span></p> <p><span>  and  nnjuBtifiable  infringement  on  tlie</span><span>  powers  conferred  by  the  Water  Supply</span><span>  Act.  We  cay  nothing  -as  to  whether</span><span>  Mr.  Oidham's  estimate  of  cost  is  correct</span><span>  or  not.  That  can  only  be  determined</span><span>  lgincr  the  works  went  betore  Jr  ariiamenc,</span><span>  since  they  said  nothing  about  it,  and</span><span>  took  the  plans  as  those  upon  which  the</span><span>  Bill  was  based  —  nothing  has  -occurred</span><span>  since  to  render  them  less  reliable.  In</span><span>  that  view  of  the  case  let  the  experiment</span></p> <p><span>  be  made,  -and  let  the  actual  tenders  for</span><span>  the  work  Settle  whether  it  is  within  the</span><span>  bounds  of  a  .  decent  economy  or  not.</span><span>  And,  indeed,  without  this,  the  inter</span><span>  ference  of  the  Executive  iB  in  the  high</span><span>  est  degree  unjustifiable.  Mr.  Gregory</span><span>  is  not  infallible  as  an  engineeer.  They</span><span>  went  themselves  in  the  .teeth  of  his  opi</span><span>  nion  on  tiie  railway  question,  and  they</span><span>  caMot  now  decree  infi01ibiIi|y  to</span><span>  him  on  the  no  less  techical  and  difficult</span><span>  matter  of  waterworks.  For  aUjhat  they</span><span>  areT  ratiUed  to  altegeHiat'a*  opinion</span><span>  of  one  engineer  is  as  good  as  anotherk</span><span>  On  mere  contrariety  of  opinion  .  the</span><span>  Government  lave  no  right  to  uuspead</span><span>  die*  effective  action  of  a  legislative</span><span>  enactment.  We  hare  the  Waterworks</span><span>  Bill  —  we  collect  from  it  the  intention</span><span>  of  Parliament.

'  '  Let  the  Executive  as</span><span>  such,  ataxy  out  the  law  :  we  should  have</span><span>  thought  that  by  this  time  they  had</span><span>  found  its  suspension  and  constructive</span><span>  interpretation  quite  troublesome  enough</span><span>  without  entering  upon  a  new  course  in</span><span>  the  same  reprehensible  direction.</span><span>  In  our  issue  of  the  20th  ultimo  we</span><span>  suggested  a  scheme  of  electoral  and</span><span>  representative  reform,  and  promised  on</span><span>  subsequent  opportunities  to  enter  into</span><span>  the  details  of  the  plan  we  then  out</span><span>  lined....  Since  then  an  attempt  was</span><span>  made  to  give  the  scheme  a  party  aspect</span><span>  and  strange  as  it  might  appear,  one  of</span><span>  the  objections  taken  to  it  was  that  the</span><span>  suffrage  was  of  too  conservative  a  cha</span><span>  racter  because  it  stipulated  a  minimum</span><span>  annual  inewne  by  wage  or  property  of</span><span>  Twenty  Poundv.  ?</span><span>  The  two  great  features  which  appear</span><span>  necessary  as  the  basistof  a  suffrage  or</span><span>  electoral  right  are  permanent  japidence</span><span>  and  actual  income  from  labor,  property,</span><span>  or  capital  To  secure  either  of  these</span></p> <p><span>  no  lower  standard  _could^-o  takei^wjtfc</span><span>  i  ffujnaim-yffise  we  pointed  out.

Objections  to  the</span><span>  scheme  might  hare  been  expected  on  very</span><span>  different  grounds.  Individuals  who</span><span>  assume  that  a  high  property  qualifica</span><span>  tion  is  essential  to  save  legislation  and</span><span>  Government  from  an  ultra-democratic</span><span>  character,  might  object  to  the  scheme</span><span>  on  the  plea  that  the  money  qualification</span><span>  was  not  sufficiently  high  to  serve  that</span><span>  purpose.  Again,  a  school  of  politicians</span><span>  particular  to  Queensland,  who  assert</span><span>  that  to  enfranchise  the  employee  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  pastoral  tenant  would  increase  the</span><span>  political  power  of  the  latter,  might  ob</span><span>  ject  because  a  minimum  of  wage  which</span><span>  would  include  the  whole  of  that  class</span><span>  has  been  adopted.  It  must  be  borne  in</span><span>  mind,  however,  by  all  who  are  disposed</span><span>  to  examine  a  new  scheme  with  fairness,</span><span>  that  the  class  of  objections  which</span><span>  would  apply  to  the  old  system  may  be</span><span>  so  provided  against  in  a  different</span><span>  scheme,  that  that  which  amounted  to</span><span>  an  evil  in  the  former  may  be  a  source</span><span>  of  advantage  and  content  in  the  latter.</span><span>  The  recent  unfortunate  complications</span><span>  in  the  United  States  of  America,  and</span><span>  the  excesses  produced  by  the  great  pre</span><span>  ponderance  of  the  Democratic  element</span><span>  in  some  of  the  British  colonies  where</span><span>  Universal  or  Manhood  Suffrage  has  been</span><span>  admitted  into  the  scheme  of  Constitu</span><span>  tional  Government,  has  dealt  a  severe</span><span>  blow  to  the  theories  of  some</span><span>  of  the  greatest'  political  authori</span><span>  ties  of  the  age.  The  question</span></p> <p><span>  may  be  said  to  be  re-opened  as  to  what</span><span>  element  forms  the  best  basis  of  electoral</span><span>  suffrage  socially  considered.  Timid  |</span><span>  ber  is  added  to  those  who  from  educa</span><span>  tion  or  conviction  are  opposed  to  the</span><span>  direct  representation  of  the  mass  of  a</span><span>  community,  they  form  so  powerful  a</span><span>  section  as  to  be  able  to  control  legisla</span><span>  tion.</span><span>  All  must  admit  that  of  late  many</span><span>  flagrant  acts  of  wrong  have  been  com</span><span>  mitted  under  the  cover  of  Manhood</span><span>  Suffrage  ;  but  the  approval  or  condem</span><span>  nation  of  a  principle  which  seems  just</span><span>  and  reasonable  in  theory  should  not  be</span><span>  judged  by  isolated  and  it  may  be  ill</span></p> <p><span>  directed  experiments.  Manhood  bun</span><span>  rage  may  be  an  essential  part  of  a  pure</span><span>  system  of  representative  Government,</span><span>  which,  when  worked  with  consonant</span><span>  parts,  would  forma  harmonious  scheme  ;</span><span>  but  which  when  required  to  act  with</span><span>  defective  parts  would  produce  derange</span><span>  ment  and  confusion.  itfc&  difficult  to</span><span>  arrive  at  the  conclusion  that  the  whole</span><span>  school  of  politicians  which  has  J.  S.</span><span>  Mill  in  its  foremost  rank  should  have,</span><span>  after  years  of  study,  given  the</span><span>  weight  of  their  authority  to  an  imprac</span><span>  ticable  fiction.  No  more  moderate</span></p> <p><span>  -conclusion  is  admitted  by  those  who</span><span>  now  assail  Manhood  Suffrage  because,</span><span>  in  the  forms  of  Government  of  which</span><span>  it  has  made  a  part  excesses  and  abuses</span><span>  detrimental  to  individual  right  and  ge</span><span>  neral  peace  have  manifested  themselves</span><span>  in  a  remarkable  manner.  We  incline</span><span>  to  a  belief  that  these  are  unfair  stric</span><span>  tures  an  Manhood  Suffrage,  and  that</span><span>  that  Electoral  element  can  no  more</span><span>  reasonably  be  charged  with  the  mischief</span><span>  arising  from  a  defective  combination,  or</span><span>  the  excesses  of  peoples  unused  to</span><span>  political  power  or  liberty,  than  is  any</span><span>  other  political  or  scientific  truth  for  its</span><span>  defective  application.</span><span>  Constitutional  Government  should</span><span>  lie  a  complete  system  of  checks,  bo  that</span><span>  no  single  part,  should  be  independent  of</span><span>  -?-..  gm,».frrol  of  the  'VDtok  |  r  ^  a.^</span><span>  electoral  scheme  successfully,,  requires</span><span>  that  there  should  be  elements  in  the</span><span>  scheme  effective  to  check  its  excess</span><span>  whenever,  it  arose,  and  without  the</span><span>  system  .  contained  such  .  powers,  the  in</span></p> <p><span>  troduction  of  Manhood  Suffrage  could</span><span>  only  be  expected  to  result  in  abuse.</span><span>  A  reason  of  this  character  is  die  true</span><span>  solution  of  the  difficulties  which  have</span><span>  attended  the  operation  of  Manhood</span><span>  Suffrage  when  introduced  into  political</span><span>  systems,  contrived  to  work  in  unison</span><span>  with  other-  electoral  -machinery.</span><span>  There  is  so  principle  of  representa</span><span>  tion  that  has  been  propounded  which</span><span>  I  seems  so  well  adapted  to  supply  the</span><span>  requisite  checks  to  manhood  suffrage  as</span><span>  the  scheme  propounded  by  BLaBK.

The  contrast  to  such  ;</span><span>  conduct  presented  by  writers,  who  see</span><span>  every  argument  of  an  antagonist</span><span>  through  a  veil  of  prejudice  and  deny</span><span>  all  merit  to  those  who  differ  with  them,</span><span>  not  on  the  merits  of  any  separate  sub</span><span>  ject,  but  on  the  general  ground  of  dif</span></p> <p><span>  ference  is  so  humbling  a  reflection  to  I</span><span>  all  who  pursue  the  career  of  journalism  j</span><span>  with  any  more  exalted  idea  than  that  of  J</span><span>  lucre,  as  to  make  them  dread  the  conse-  I</span><span>  quences  on  society  and  look  with  con-  I</span><span>  tempt  on  the  mental  powers  of  those  ]</span><span>  who  can  be,  even  in  seeming,  restricted  I</span><span>  to  such  narrow  bounds.  j</span><span>  To  difference  of  opinion  and  con</span><span>  sistent  advocacy  of  that  which  each  I</span><span>  man  of  mind  believes  to  be  right,  the</span><span>  human  family  is  largely  indebted  for  its</span><span>  progress  and  die  discovery  of  the  forces</span><span>  and  appliances  which  conduce  to  com-  I</span><span>  fort,  enlightenment,  and  independence,  j</span><span>  The  right  to  differ  and  discuss,  under-  '</span><span>  stood  in  its  proper  application,  is  most  \</span><span>  valuable  and  should  be  respected  and</span><span>  guarded  by  all  who  undertake  to  direct</span><span>  or  enlighten  their  fellow-men.  Tory,</span><span>  Whig,  Conservative,  or  Radical,  or  by</span><span>  whatever  other  designation  any  political</span></p> <p><span>  section  may  be  known,  should  ever  keep</span><span>  before  them  in  their  enunciation  of</span><span>  opinions  or  theories  of  liberty  and  Go</span><span>  vernment,  and  in  their  teachings,  that</span><span>  all  are  equally  liable  to  err  and  that</span><span>  most  men  are  equally  sincere  in  their</span><span>  convictions,  however  great  may  be  the  J</span><span>  disparity  between  their  opinions  and</span><span>  those  of  their  neighbours.

It  is  not  our</span><span>  purpose  on  the  present  occasion  to  dis</span><span>  cuss  the  general  question,  whether  the</span><span>  said  antipathy  of  our  brethren  in  the</span><span>  other  -hemisphere  is-  real,  or  merely</span><span>  affected  to  suit  the  circumstances  of  the</span><span>  social  fabric  and  tbe  education  of  the</span><span>  generation  to  which  its  restraint  is  ap</span><span>  plied  ;  but  it  is  impossible  to  pass  the</span><span>  subject  without  remarking  that,  how</span><span>  ever  persistent  and  continuous  may</span><span>  have  been  the  objections  to  change</span><span>  and  novelty,  no  nation  on  the  face</span><span>  of  the  earth  has  made  so  many</span><span>  salutary  alterations  in  its  polity</span></p> <p><span>  and  Government  as  our  nominally</span><span>  conservative  Fatherland.  The  con</span><span>  struction  placed  upon  the  doctrines  of</span><span>  the  parly  by  the  Tory  of  1863,  is  as</span><span>  different  from  the  construction  of  the</span><span>  same  doctrines  a  century  ago,  as  are  the</span><span>  supposed  doctrines  which  divide  the</span><span>  Liberal  from  the  Tory  of  the  present</span><span>  day.</span><span>  The  portion  of  our  contemporary's</span><span>  objections  which  we  desire  to  review  on</span><span>  the  present  occasion  has  reference  to  the</span><span>  bads  of  representation.  The  principle</span><span>  is  the  more  worthy  of  consideration</span><span>  because  whatever  system  may  be  placed</span><span>  on  the  base,  there  are  only  as  yet  known</span><span>  in  Parliamentary  Governments  three</span><span>  schemes  of  right  to  representation.</span><span>  These,  speaking  generally,  are  popula</span><span>  tion,  property  or  intelligence,  and:  a</span><span>  mixed  form  combining  in  -  diverse</span><span>  proportion*  ..Alia,  .tfcio*  iBgroUriHB—  '</span><span>  population,  'wealth,  and  education.</span><span>  To  the  first  in  order,  die</span><span>  principle  of  basing  representation  on</span><span>  population,  our  contemporary  objects  on</span><span>  the  ground  that  the  scheme  would  be</span><span>  unfair  to  Ceatr^  andNorUifini^Jucej^ov</span><span>  support  of  the  proposition  the  sparse</span><span>  ness  of  poj^aiion  in  these  divisions'of</span><span>  tbe  -colony,  and  the  proportion  .  of  toe  '</span><span>  contributions  of  these  districts  to</span><span>  the  revenue  as  compared  with  that  of</span><span>  the  densar-  population  of  the  Southern,</span><span>  division.  '  We  an  prepared  to  diner</span><span>  -with  our  contemporary  on  this  principle,</span><span>  and  to  maintain-that,  as  a  general  rule</span><span>  population  is  the  justeet  and  most</span><span>  liberal  basis  of  representation.</span><span>  -  It  is  our  desire  not  to  be  immediately</span><span>  identified  with  any  locality  in  the</span><span>  colony  on  this  question,  or  any  other</span><span>  of  general  political  importance:  We</span><span>  have  endeavoured  to  prove  jbj  our  part</span><span>  condnct,  that  on  subjects  *f  this  nature</span><span>  we  are  -not  bound  by  any  local  consider</span><span>  ation,  but  by  that  which  we  look  spon</span><span>  as  jthe  general,  good.  Therefore,  we</span><span>  deny  .the  i^undness  of  «ur  oontompo</span><span>  rar^s  argument,  and  are  at  issue  on</span><span>  the  nine  of  tiie  evidence  brought  for</span><span>  wari  to  -support  #.  3!fo:*taitrtiMt  j</span><span>  large  .jpongrijgMwnB  «rT  pqraUiioa</span><span>  massed  in  towns  Cannot  expect  to  be</span><span>  represented  in  the  time  proportioa  «s</span></p> <p><span>  smaller  urban  or  subnrban  communi</span><span>  ties;  but  this  exception  to  the  rule</span><span>  granted,  we  hold  that  population  is  the</span><span>  most  equitable  basis  of  representation.</span><span>  The  admission  just  made  clears  the</span><span>  controveay  .of  one  of  our  contemporary's</span><span>  arguments,  aud  leads  to  -one</span><span>  which  has  little  reason  to  be  relied  on.</span><span>  It  is  argued  that  because,  immigration</span><span>  has  not  been  sent  to  these  divisions  of</span><span>  the  colony  in  the  ratio  in  which  they</span><span>  had  a  claim  to  receive  it,  that  therefore</span><span>  they  should  have  the  representation  al</span><span>  though  minus  the  population.  It  may*</span><span>  be  freely  admitted  that  if  North  and:</span><span>  Central  Queensland  have  not  received</span><span>  their  fair  share  of  immigration,</span><span>  that  is  a  grievance  to  the  redress  of</span></p> <p><span>  which  they  are  justly  entitled  ;  but  to</span><span>  assert  (hat  country  should  be  represented</span><span>  without  population  would  be  m  greater</span><span>  injustice  to'  the  people  of  the  South</span><span>  than  any  which  is  likely  to  'be  borne  by  j</span><span>  the  .  other  divisions  from  a  want  of  a  j</span><span>  fair  share  of  representation.  Let  the  I</span><span>  people  in  these  divisions  change  places  J</span><span>  with  their  neighbours  in  the  South,  and</span><span>  then  say,  whether  they  would  be  willing</span><span>  to  admit  the  argument,  that  because</span><span>  population  was  not  there  which  should</span><span>  have  been,  hut  was  elsewhere  in  the</span><span>  ferath,-  therefpqa  the  North  should  have</span><span>  the  representation  of  these  people.</span><span>  The  third  and  last  argument  which</span><span>  we  shall  allude  to  at  present,  appears  to</span><span>  be  a  statistical  feet  ;  it  is,  however,  un</span><span>  sound  and  opposed  to  the  experience  of</span><span>  years  and  of  the  mother  country  as</span><span>  well  as  the  British  OClonles:  Itis  alleged</span><span>  that  the  people  of  Central  and  Northern</span><span>  I  Queensland  pays  numerically  a  greater</span><span>  contribution  to  the  taxation  of  the</span><span>  country  than  their  Southern  neighbours,</span><span>  and  that  therefore  they  should  be  re</span><span>  presented  according  to  their  proportion</span></p> <p><span>  of  taxation  and  not  their  numbers.</span><span>  If  this  was  a  fact,  the  result</span><span>  of  the  calculations  of  years</span><span>  and  of  careful  averages,  we  are  ready  to</span><span>  allow  that  it  would  be  a  strong  plea  in</span><span>  favor  of  exceptional  treatment.  But  it</span><span>  is  not  a  new  argument,  for  it  has  been</span><span>  urged  elsewhere,  and  its  fallacy  proved.</span><span>  The  result  of  one,  two,  or  three  years</span><span>  after  the  settlement  of  a  district  may</span><span>  furnish  exceptional  figures  as  they  show</span><span>  the  value  of  stock,  chattel  property,</span><span>  and  trade  appliances,  but  these  require</span><span>  ments  satisfied  which  have  before,  been</span><span>  met  in  the  older  districts,  taxation  is</span><span>  found  to  be  in  proportion  to  popu</span><span>  lation.  During  the  controversy</span><span>  on  the  British  Reform  Bill,  the  fact  was</span><span>  also  proved  ;  and  further,  it  was</span><span>  established  beyond  question,  that  in</span><span>  different  districts,  whether  agricultural</span><span>  or  manufacturing,  equal  numbers  of</span></p> <p><span>  population  gave  the  like  value  ot  pro</span><span>  perty.  We  have  not  time  at  present  to</span><span>  proceed  farther  with  the  argument,</span><span>  but  shall  return  to  it  on  an  early  occa</span><span>  sion.</span></p> ",Article,1863-12-01,"The North Australian.

In  the  Gazette  of  the  14th  we</span><span>  find  a  notice  that  tenders  will  be  re</span><span>  ceived  at  the  Colonial  Secretary's  Office</span><span>  until  11  a.m.  on  the  31st  December  and</span><span>  until  11  a.m.  on  the  31st  March,  1864,</span><span>  for  the  conveyance  of  passengers  from</span><span>  Great  Britain  ?o  Queensland.

The  most  remarkable  cir-</span><span>  cumstance,  however,  is  that  by  this  no</span><span>  tice  '  attention  is  called  to  the  Immi</span><span>  '  gration  Regulations  published  in  the</span><span>  '  Queensland  Government  Gazette  of</span><span>  «  this  date  ;'  the  fact  being  that  6uch</span><span>  Gazette  contains  nothing  of  the  kind.</span><span>  Under  these  circumstances  the  call  for</span><span>  tenders  will  be  of  little  use  this  mail,</span><span>  none  of  the  conditions  or  restrictions</span><span>  upon  the  contractor  being  apparent.  We.</span><span>  presnme  this  is  a  sample  of  the  great</span><span>  accuracy  of  business  under  the  Govern</span><span>  ment  genejrauy.</span><span>  Along  with  this  notice  appears</span><span>  another  adverting  to  tbe  construction  of</span><span>  a  new  Immigration  Board,  consisting  of</span><span>  the  Immigration  Agent,  the  Water£Po</span><span>  lice  Magistrate,  the  Port  Master,  the</span><span>  Health  Officer,  Dr.  Cannan,  the  Coro</span><span>  ner,  and  Mr.  Shaw,  the  BaiTister—  a</span><span>  new  arrival.  These  concessions'  came</span><span>  late,  but  we  suppose  on  the  principle  of</span><span>  '  better  late  than  never,'  we  are  to  be</span></p> <p><span>  grateful.</span><span>  Leaving  this  matter,  there  have  been</span><span>  sundry  rumours  afloat  touching  the</span><span>  want  of  concord  between  the  members</span><span>  of  the  Ministry,  which  seem  to  have</span><span>  some  slight  foundation.  They  point</span><span>  powerfully  to  a  difference  or  differences</span><span>  between  Messrs.  Hebbebx  and  Mac</span><span>  Aijster,  the  former  of  whom  is  said  to</span><span>  ride  rather  rusty  at  the  distatorial  tone</span><span>  of  his  colleague.  Some  slight  indica</span><span>  tions  of  these  differences  have  been  Buf</span><span>  fered  to  escape,  but  whether  they</span><span>  amount  to  enough  to  justify  all  that</span><span>  zealous  politicians  would  build  upon</span><span>  them  tame  only  will  shew.

It  was  not  contem</span><span>  plated  by  that  enactment  that  the  Go</span><span>  vernment  should  take  upon  itself  the</span><span>  details  of  shipping  or  the  restriction  of</span><span>  tbe  trade  to  any  particular  line  of</span><span>  shippers.  The  requirements  of  the</span><span>  law  were  simple  and  direct  :  the  colony</span><span>  required  population  of  a  respectable</span><span>  and  industrious  class,  the  Commissioner</span><span>  in  Great  Britain  certified  tbe  presence</span><span>  of  these  qualities  and  of  health  and</span><span>  proper  age  in  the  emigrant,  and  the</span><span>  Government  here  checked  his  proceed</span><span>  ings  before  giving  the  land  order.</span><span>  Such  a  course  was  virtually  all  that  the</span><span>  law  required  for  its  efficient  fulfilment.</span><span>  The  Government  and  the  Commissioner,</span><span>  -  however,  were  not  content  that  the  de</span><span>  tails  of  emigration  should  be  conducted</span><span>  by  persons  who  understood  its  irorktng,</span><span>  they  aimed  at  the  creation  of  a  mo</span><span>  nopoly  and  a  seeming  saving  to  the</span><span>  colony,  they  were  actuated  to  make</span><span>  these  alterations  by  considerations  and</span><span>  motives  most  reprehensible  in  public</span><span>  servants.</span><span>  When  the  Parliamentary  chief  of  the</span><span>  Executive  left  the  colony  on  a  hurried</span><span>  and  nnsanctioned  visit  to  Eugland,  it</span><span>  was  given  out  that  he  was  called  borne  ,</span><span>  would  have  believed  that  be  purposed</span></p> <p><span>  illegally  interfering  with  the  system  of</span><span>  emigration  then  in  operation,  or  giving</span><span>  extraordinary  and  unchecked  powers  to</span><span>  the  Emigration  Commissioner  and  a</span><span>  monopoly  to  Mackat,  Baikes,  &  Co.</span><span>  Nor  was  it  fully  known  until  a  con</span><span>  siderable  time  after  his  return  that  he</span><span>  bad  so  acted,  and  the  interim  bad  been</span><span>  used  to  obtain  support  of  an  un</span><span>  scrupulous  majority  in  the  Assem</span><span>  bly.  But  that  support  did  not</span><span>  cure  the  new  scheme  from  the  de</span><span>  fects  which  it  was  calculated  to</span><span>  foster,  and  these  soon  began  to  be  ob</span><span>  servable  in  the  conduct  of  the  ships  and</span><span>  the  character  of  some  of  the  immi</span><span>  grants.  Queensland  claims  to  be  as</span><span>  moral  a  colony  as  any  under  the  British</span><span>  Crown,  and  the  rumours  and  actual</span><span>  evidence  which  soon  found  their  way  to</span><span>  the  public  ear  were  of  too  gross  and  un</span><span>  mistakeable  a  character  to  admit  of</span><span>  longer  silence.  Individuals  who  bad</span><span>  nrives.  sisters  or  female  relations  whom</span></p> <p><span>  they  wished  to  join  them,  objected  to</span><span>  bringing  them  under  a  system  in  such</span><span>  bad  repute  ;  and  the  impression  exten</span><span>  sively  obtained  currency  that  unless,</span><span>  eome  alteration  was  made,  as  soon</span><span>  as  the  respectable  immigrants  who  had</span><span>  arrived  communicated  their  experience</span><span>  to  friends  in  Great  Britain,  emigration</span><span>  to  the  colony  would  receive  a  severe</span><span>  check.</span><span>  The  best  evidence  of  the  utter  failure</span><span>  of  the  new  system  was  made  dear  by</span><span>  the  course  pursued  with  regard  to  ao</span><span>  enquiry  into  the  abuses  which  it  bad</span><span>  produced  by  persons  admittedly  favor</span><span>  able  to  the  Government  and  its  Com</span><span>  missioner.  This  party,  believing  tbat</span><span>  enquiry  was  not  to  be  evaded,  deter</span><span>  mined  to  take  the  initiative,  and</span><span>  thereby  stve  the  persons  responsible</span><span>  for  the  scheme  from  the  public  censure</span><span>  -wl»U»h~4lM-y-  Jnnnnrnr]  J8y  m.  cunning</span><span>  selection  of  the  individuals  to  address  a</span><span>  public  meeting  in  Brisbane,  they  par</span></p> <p><span>  tially  achieved  their  purpose,  but  only</span><span>  at  the  cost  of  disclosing  how  great  must</span><span>  be  the  evils  which  required  the  exer</span><span>  cise  of  such  tactics.  After  this  disco</span><span>  very,  many  believed  that  very  little  of</span><span>  service  for  the  improvement  of  immi</span><span>  gration  would  arise  out  of  the  pro</span><span>  ceedings.  But  notwithstanding  this</span><span>  impression,  the  proceedings  of  the</span><span>  deputation  appointed  by  the  meeting,</span><span>  and  of  the  -Government  on  whom  it  was</span><span>  to  wait  were  watched  with  considerable</span><span>  interest  and  anxiety.  The  reception  of</span><span>  die  deputation,  although  courteous  in</span><span>  manner,  had  that  in  its  tone  which</span><span>  proved  how  little  the  interferenoe  of  the</span><span>  public  in  the  matter  was  relished  by  tbe</span><span>  head  of  the  Government.  But  while</span><span>  public  eotion  was  condemned,  and  the</span><span>  abases  admitted,  which  could  no</span><span>  longer  lie  denied,  excuses  were  alleged,</span><span>  difficulties  to  the  echeme  magnified,  ani</span><span>  stress  laid  mpon  investigatione  .thatdid</span><span>  not  ttoseVihe  publio  ?demands.

His  inquiry  into  the</span><span>  conduct  of  the  surgeons  of  two  of  tbe</span><span>  ships  was  all  in  the  shape  of  investiga</span><span>  tion  that  could  be  pointed  to.  Although</span><span>  not  by  any  means  the  best,  nor  even</span><span>  likely  to  work  well,  the  alterations</span><span>  brought  about  by  the  recent</span><span>  agitation  will  be  .  productive  of</span><span>  good  in  checking  the  proceedings  of  the</span><span>  Emigration  Commissioner  and  the</span><span>  shippers  which,  up  to  the  present  time,</span><span>  have  been  open  to  mnch  abuse.</span><span>  The  present  mail  takeB  to  Great</span><span>  Britain  advertisements  calling  for  ten</span><span>  ders  from  shippers  willing  to  carry  emi</span><span>  grants  under  a  new  code  of  regulations.</span><span>  Henceforth  the  shippers  will  have  to</span><span>  deal  directly  with  the  Colonial  Go</span><span>  vernment  ;  and  the  appointment  of  a</span><span>  new  and  enlarged  Immigration  Board</span><span>  proves  that  in  future  the  system  trill</span><span>  receive  more  attention.  It  is  a</span><span>  great  pity  that  a  project  of</span><span>  so  much  importance  to  the  colony</span><span>  and  to  the  working  classes  of</span><span>  the  empire  should  have  been  deranged</span><span>  by  narrow  feeling  and  cupidity,  but  the</span></p> <p><span>  unmistakable  character  of  public  opinion</span><span>  in  the  colony  has  already  done  much  to</span><span>  repair  the  evil  ;  and,  we  are  sure  that</span><span>  in  the  future,  no  exertion  will  be  spared</span><span>  to  force  the  Government  to  make  the</span><span>  system  alt  that  it  was  iutended  to  be  —</span><span>  the  best  and  most  liberal  emigration</span><span>  scheme  belonging  to  any  British  pos</span><span>  session.</span><span>  We  make  no  excuse  for  devoting  so</span><span>  large  a  space  in  our  present  issne,  to  a</span><span>  subject  of  -suoh  concern  to  both  the</span><span>  eclouist  and  the  intending  emigrant.</span><span>  No  greater  service  could  be  done  to</span><span>  either  at  the  present  juncture,  than  to</span><span>  give  the  widest  publicity  to  every</span><span>  thing  connected  with  the  subject.  We</span><span>  hope  to  see  the  case  fairly  treated  and</span><span>  expounded  by  the  Press  in  the  mother</span><span>  country,  and  that  all  interested  there</span><span>  in  emigration  will  second  the  wish  of</span><span>  the  colonists,  by  looking  for  guarantees</span><span>  that  those  wiio  emigrate  shall  be  pro</span><span>  perly  treated  and  protected  on  the  voy</span><span>  age.

It  cannot  be</span><span>  justly  asserted  as,  was  formerly  done,</span><span>  that  the  discontent  at  the  Regulations</span><span>  of  the  existing  system  is  confined  to</span><span>  the  ecclesiastical  heads  of  two  denomi</span><span>  nations  and  a  few  of  their  clergymen.</span><span>  The  merits  of  the  whole  discussion  be</span><span>  tween  these  denominations  and  the</span><span>  Board  of  Education  are  now  generally</span><span>  understood  and  the  requirements  stipu</span><span>  lated  for  in  schools  by  the  heads  of  the</span><span>  denominations,  are  fully  concurred  in</span><span>  by  .  the  members.  When  the  change</span><span>  asked  for  in  tbe  existing  Regulations  is</span><span>  considered,  it  can  neither  be  looked</span><span>  upon  as  unfair  to  the  interests  of  other</span><span>  denominations,  nor  of  such  a  description</span><span>  as  to  impair  the  progress  or  efficiency-  of</span><span>  the  present  public  schools.  It  is  simply</span><span>  stipulated  that  as  both  these  large  de</span><span>  nominations  —  including  two-thirds  of</span><span>  the  inhabitants  of  the  colony  —  view  re</span><span>  ligious  training  as  an  essential  part  of</span><span>  education,  they  may  be  allowed  schools</span><span>  in  all  large  centres  of  population,</span><span>  wherein,  in  addition  to  the  present  secular</span><span>  lessons  orderedby  the  Regulations,  there</span><span>  shall  be  one  hour's  religious  instructions</span><span>  given  on  each  day.</span><span>  It  is  not  asked  to  confine  these</span><span>  schools  to  either  of  the  denominations,</span><span>  except  only  during  the  hour  set  apart</span><span>  for  religious  teaching,  nor  to  depart</span><span>  from  tbe  general  system  in  the  select</span><span>  ing  of  teachers  of  proved  capabilities,</span><span>  nor  in  the  fitting,  furnishing,  or  ma</span><span>  nagement  of  the  schools.  So  desirous,</span><span>  also,  are  the  heads  of  these  denomina</span><span>  tions  to  meet  by  every  means  in  their</span><span>  discretion  the  ecruples  of  others,  and  to</span><span>  aid  in  the  enccessana  economy  oF  a</span><span>  iNPIMP^rHHffVffmsinali  an3'</span><span>  thinly  peopled,  districts;  the  religious</span><span>  instructions  to  tie  given  in  each  school</span><span>  shall  accord  with  die  belief  of  die</span><span>  majority  of  the  pnpils,  attending  «uch</span><span>  school.</span><span>  To  many  —  unacquainted  with  the</span><span>  character  of  the  first  Board  of  Education</span><span>  and  the  opportunities  afforded  by  an</span><span>  Act  of  Parliament  for  refusing  all  con</span><span>  cessions,  which  would  appear  to  trespass</span><span>  on  its  provisions,  however  slightly—  the</span><span>  objection  to  the  admission  of  an  arrange</span><span>  ment  which  would  have  made  the  public</span><span>  system  of  Education,  indeed,  a,  general</span><span>  system  must  appear  strange  and  unac</span><span>  countable.  .  But  the  peculiarity  of  the</span><span>  refusal  to  entertain  the  proposal  is</span><span>  readily  ^accounted  for,  when  it  is  known</span><span>  that  tbe  Board  of  Education  were  firm</span><span>  partisans  of  the  scheme  distinguished</span><span>  as  Uational  Education,  and  that  they</span><span>  pere  aware  the  Bime  opinions  were  held</span><span>  by  a  eompaot.paity^in  Parliament.  It</span><span>  was,  therefore,  easy  for  them  to  charge</span><span>  an  objection  which  suited  their  own</span><span>  opiniooBso^illy  on  thu  Ant  iff  Parlia*</span><span>  ment,and|to  aver  that  until  its  provi</span><span>  rioiu  *ere  repealed  the  change  Wuld</span><span>  notbeeSected.  .

They  had</span><span>  for  the  pet  project  a  bo  much  greater</span><span>  endowment,  and  that  to  them  was  the</span><span>  chief  consideration.</span><span>  But  to  the  Board  of  Education  is  not</span><span>  attributable  tbe  entire  blame  of  the</span><span>  present  unsatisfactory  condition  of</span><span>  Education.  The  members  of  the  de</span><span>  nominations  which  cannot  participate</span><span>  in  the  Education  as  at  present  regu</span><span>  lated,  have  not  directed  the  influence</span><span>  which  they  possess  to  obtain  a  repeal  of</span><span>  the  obnoxious  Clauses  of  the  Act;  nor</span><span>  have  they  manifested  those  signs  of  dis</span><span>  satisfaction  which,  in  political  affairs,</span><span>  are  looked  for  as  the  preliminary  steps</span><span>  towards  the  removal  of  an  abase.  They</span><span>  have  not  met  to  give  expression  to</span><span>  their  discontent  at  the  disabilities  which</span><span>  theygare  compelled  to  endure  ;  they</span><span>  have  not  generally  uBed  their  right  of</span><span>  petition  against  the  grievance  which</span><span>  forces  them  to  pay  for  a  system  of</span><span>  education,  which  they  cannot  use  as  at</span><span>  present  regulated  ;  aud  they  have  not</span><span>  questioned  candidates  for  Parliamentary</span><span>  position  as  to  their  opinions  on  tbe</span><span>  question.  True,  two  or  three  indirect</span><span>  attempts  have  been  made  to  learn  the</span><span>  views  of  the  Assembly  on  tbe  subject,</span><span>  but  they  were  conducted  with  so  much</span><span>  they  were  stigmas  on  tbe  -two  luge'</span><span>  denominations,  whose  grievances  they</span><span>  assumed  to  deal  with.</span><span>  It  is  not  by  individual  complaint</span><span>  nor  by  throwing  the  duty  o.7  agitation</span><span>  on  others,  that  rights  are  gained  or</span><span>  maintained.  Let  those  who  suffer  by</span><span>  the  present  system  of  education  take</span><span>  example  by  those  to  whom  in  this</span><span>  matter  they  are  opposed.  They  are  to</span><span>  the  thick-and-thin  supporters  of  the</span><span>  present  system  as  two  to  one,  but  they</span><span>  do  not  display  one  fourth  of  the  poli</span><span>  tical  tact  of  their  opponents  —  otherwise</span><span>  60  great  an  anomaly  could  not  exist  as</span><span>  that  a  large  majority  should  be  ruled</span><span>  by  a  minority  whom  they  allow  to  use</span><span>  the  funds  contributed  by  the  whole</span><span>  for  education.  It  is  a  disgrace  to  the</span><span>  majority  to  permit  this  state  of  things</span><span>  to  continue.  By  their  apathy  they  not</span><span>  only  lose  the  advantages  of  the  educa</span><span>  tion  grant,  but  they  also  supply  a  paw</span><span>  *erful  argument  to  their  opponents,</span><span>  wh6m  they  justify  in  assuming  that</span><span>  they  are  not  opposed  to  the  present</span><span>  scheme,  when  they  make  no  concerted</span><span>  effort  for  its  repeal.  This  assumption,</span><span>  however  ill-founded  it  may  be,  is  ouly</span></p> <p><span>  a  fair  interpretation  of  their  conduct  ;</span><span>  and,  so  long  as  they  are  content  to  ne</span><span>  glect  the  only  proper  course  by  which</span><span>  they  can  expect  to  obtain  fair  play  and</span><span>  a  return  for  their  own  contributions  to</span><span>  the  funds  for  education,  they  deserve</span><span>  neither  to  be  pitied  nor  assisted.</span><span>  Are  those  who  suffer  by  the  present</span><span>  system  afraid  of  the  untruthful  cry,  of</span><span>  '  National  Education,'  that  they  have</span><span>  not  spirit  enough  to  demand  that  any</span><span>  education  to  be  supported  from  their</span><span>  pockete  must  in  truth  be  National</span><span>  Education,  in  which  all  may  partake</span><span>  without  scruple  of  conscience  —  not  a</span><span>  questionable  novelty  belonging  to  the</span><span>  dm«nIimtioiiB  wbfch  object  to  tbe  ex</span><span>  isting  system,  acceptable  only  to  tbe</span><span>  few  ?  Is  every  man  williug  that  some</span><span>  twenty  shillings  of  bis  money  should  go</span><span>  to  sustain  such  a  scheme,  while  he  has</span><span>  to  pay  heavy  school-fees  for  the  educa</span><span>  tion  of  his  own  children?  If  the</span><span>  members  of  the  largest  denomi</span><span>  nations  in  the  community  are  not</span><span>  ashamed  of  tbe  sentiments  in  which  they</span><span>  have  been  reared  ;  or,  if  they  desire  to</span><span>  obtain  for  their  children  the  same  in</span><span>  struction  which  was  instilled  into  Jbeir</span><span>  own  minds  in  youth,  let  them  openly</span><span>  express  their  opinion,  and  show  by</span><span>  earnestness  and  firmness,  that  they  are</span><span>  determinedito  have  for  themselves  that</span><span>  which  they  willingly  admit  to  all  others,</span><span>  perfect  respect  for  coascieutous  convic</span><span>  tions.  It  requires  ouly  such  a  display</span><span>  to  place  public  education  on  a  thorougly</span><span>  satisfactory?  basis.  -t  No  ^interference</span><span>  with  or  injury  to  existing  public  schools</span><span>  would  result  from  such  an  agitation.</span><span>  These  are  known  to  be  satisfactory  to</span><span>  some  portions  of  the  community  ;  there</span><span>  fore,  let  them  continue  to  enjoy  them.</span><span>  But  at  the  same  time  let  the  claim  be</span><span>  made  resolutely  that  the  dissatisfied</span><span>  portion  at  present  be  henceforth  equally</span><span>  as  well  provided  /or  in  school  accom</span><span>  modation.</span><span>  It  is  due  to  the  heads  of  the  denomi</span><span>  nations  who  made  the  demand  for  a</span><span>  more  generally  satisfactory  system  on</span><span>  behalf  of  their  co-religiouists,  that  the</span><span>  members  of  those  denominations  should</span><span>  insist  on  the  demand  being  complied</span><span>  with.  It  is  a  just  and  an  essential  de</span><span>  mand,  which  in  no  way  trespasses  on</span><span>  the  rights  of  others.  Numerically  tbe</span><span>  members  of  the  denominations  in</span><span>  terested  are  largely  in  excess  of  all</span><span>  others,  consequently,  they  contribute</span><span>  the  largest  share  of  tbe  Education  fund,</span><span>  PaHiament  Such  being  the  case,  they</span><span>  bave  only  to  remember  their  power  and</span><span>  resolve  that  the  Education  Regulations</span><span>  shall  be  altered  80  as  to  admit  the  in</span><span>  struction  of  all  denominations  —  and</span><span>  their  will  must  be  obeyed.</span><span>  There  is  no  opportunity  like  the  pre</span><span>  sent  For  commencing  to  do  right,  and</span><span>  claiming  equal  rights  with  our  fellows</span><span>  in  all  advantages  derived  from  the  out</span><span>  lay  of  public  funds.  If  education  is  to</span><span>  be  supported  by  the  State,  let  us  bave</span><span>  our  share  of  it  in  a  palatable  form.  Re</span><span>  presentatives  in  Parliament  are  now  at</span><span>  home  among  their  constituencies.

The  energetic  pursuit  of</span><span>  a  moderate  and  firm  policy  by  the</span><span>  party  aggrieved  throughout  the  colony</span><span>  would  lead  to  aiueaxly  reconsideration</span><span>  of  tiie  Eddcaciojp^stem:  That  consi</span><span>  deration  once  undertaken  in  a  honest</span><span>  desire  to  serve  all,  the  result  must'be</span><span>  the  adoption,  of  tbe  suggestions  made  to</span></p> <p><span>  and  refused  by  the  Board  of  Education.</span><span>  There  is  no  father  of  a  family  who  is</span><span>  not  directly  interested  in  the  question</span><span>  of  education,  and  there  is  no  member  of</span><span>  society  who  has  not  a  general  interest</span><span>  in  its  progress  and  equitable  settle</span><span>  ment;  and  the  obligations  of  both</span><span>  will  be  best  and  most  serviceably  ful</span><span>  filled  by  joining  -with  their  neighbours,</span><span>  who  suffer  from  the  present  publio</span><span>  Education  Regulations,  in  making  the</span><span>  agitation  we  now  recommend,  as  exten</span><span>  sive,  as  firm,  and  as  conclusive,  as  will</span><span>  secure  to  the  colony  a  truly  general</span><span>  system  of  public  Education.</span><span>  We  have  no  desire  to  mis  ourselves  up  in</span><span>  neighbours'  quarrels,  especially  when  the</span><span>  combatants  appear  to  be  pretty  equally</span><span>  matched,  and  have  a  regard  for  the  excel</span><span>  lent  advice—  '  Be  angry  and  sin  not.'

'  'SPhe  .  iSSEB|PpffipK^-iaHJ|^B</span><span>  might,  according  to  tbe  statement,  have  ^™^B</span><span>  farmed  portion  of  a  leading  article  ™</span><span>  or  an  advertisement.  Such  loose</span><span>  ness  of  expression  might  have  been</span><span>  excused  in  a  person  unused  to  public  writ</span><span>  ing,  bnt  in  an  author  and  proprietor  of  a</span><span>  newspaper,  the  vagueness  cannot  be  looked</span><span>  npon  as  accidental,  but  as  the  result  of  deli</span><span>  berate  design.  Had  the  Bev.  gentleman</span><span>  stated  that  the  insinnations  were  contained</span><span>  in  a  letter  signed  'Inquirer,'  there  could</span><span>  have  been  no  mistake  as  to  the  authority</span><span>  for  the  insinuations.  But  so  milch  straight</span><span>  forward  truthfulness  would  not  hare  served</span><span>  the  purpose  of  implicating  this  journal  in</span><span>  that  irhich  lie  asserts  to  be  an  erroneous</span><span>  statement.  It  is  well  known  that  when</span><span>  newspapers  are  honestly  conducted,  jour</span><span>  nalists  are  not  held  responsible  for  state</span><span>  ments  made  by  correspondents.  Mr.</span><span>  Wigut  may  have  thought  that  he</span><span>  was  dealing  with  a  journal  whose</span><span>  correspondence  was  manufactured  in  its</span><span>  own  office,  or  a  jonrnal  which  allowed  dis</span><span>  senting  ministers  to  sign  their  contributions</span><span>  '  A  Human  Catholic,'  when  such  a  signa</span><span>  ture  SerVpil  ft  nnrnneo  actli-if'Sa  nnt  mi.</span></p> <p><span>  habit  or  intention,  we  are  resolved  to  claim</span><span>  only  the  merit  which  belongs  to  us.  We</span><span>  are  disposed  to  make  every  allowance  for</span><span>  Mr.  Wight's  indignation  at  the  lamentable</span><span>  venality  of  a  portion  of  the  Press  in  abus</span><span>  ingeverbody  io  the  vuuee  and  himself  and  two</span><span>  or  three  other  great  personages  in  particular;</span><span>  but  we  humbly  suggest  that  to  imitate  &</span><span>  supposed  abuse  is  not  the  orthodox  mode  '?</span><span>  reforming  it,  either  by  assigi»*'g  Insinua</span><span>  tions  to  a  source  from  which  they  do  not</span><span>  come,  or  by  bolstering  up  a  questioned  po</span><span>  sition  by  as  questionable  a  statement.  In</span><span>  this  latter  allusion  we  refer  to  the  statement</span><span>  in  reference  to  the  Catholic  chaplain</span><span>  of  the  Prince  Consort,  The  Queensland</span><span>  Emigration  Society  agreed  with  the  ship</span><span>  ownera  fur  tbe  first  cabin  passages  of  tbeir</span><span>  surgeon  and  chaplain  ;  and  to  assert  that</span><span>  the  chaplain  of  the  Piince  Consort  had  a</span><span>  free  passage  given  him  by  the  shippers,  is</span><span>  not  the  fact,  as  his  passage  was  as  much  a</span><span>  portion  of  the  contract  with  the  Society  as</span><span>  any  other  emigrant's  on  board.  We  are  not</span><span>  so  devoid  of  the  spirit  of  charity  as  to  wish</span><span>  to  assail  Mr.  Wight  when  he  it</span><span>  otherwise  engaged,  but  through  a</span><span>  regard  for  that  truthfulness  which,</span><span>  he  professes  to  admire,  and  a.  deter</span><span>  mination  to  be  relieved  from  an  unjust  tn</span><span>  tinuation.  added  to  the  ability  to  set  him</span><span>  right  on  a  point  where  be  is  in  error,  in</span><span>  drawing  a  comparison  between  himself  and</span><span>  a  chaplain  sent  out  by  the  Queensland  Emi</span><span>  gration  Society,  we  thought  it  onr  duty</span><span>  to  call  bis  attention  to  the  facts,  in  the  hope</span><span>  that  he  will  see  the  justice  of  being  more</span><span>  careful  in  the  arrangement  of  his  matter</span><span>  when  be  next  becomes  censor.</span></p> ",Article,1863-11-07,"The North Australian.

Only  a</span><span>  very  few  in  the  trade  can  stand  the  ontloy</span><span>  attendant  upon  this  mnde  of  purchasing:</span><span>  the  conseqnence  is,  that  the  trade  is  in  the</span><span>  hands  of  these  few,  and  the  smaller  dealers</span><span>  are  obliged  to  buy  from  the  larger  butchers.</span><span>  The  pnbio  in  general  are  the  sufferers  in</span><span>  this  case,  and  the  price  of  beef  and  mutton</span><span>  is  thereby  kept  up  at  the  present  high</span><span>  rates.</span><span>  During  the  past  month  Mr.  Cbawfobd</span><span>  states  having  also  disposed  of  several  small</span><span>  lots  of  milch  cows  at  fair  prices,  ranging</span><span>  from  £4  10s.  to  £8.

This  is  a  slight  increase  in</span><span>  number  on  last  month's  sale,  which  is  owing,</span><span>  no  doult,  to  the  high  rates  of  carriage  to  the</span><span>  various  gold-fields  of  Queensland.  The  im</span><span>  porters  of  horse  stock  to  this  market  liave  at</span><span>  last  seen  the  necessity  of  trading  in  good</span><span>  sound  yonng  draught  stock  to  realize  any</span><span>  thing  like  remunerative  prices  ;  and  we  may</span><span>  now  look  forward  to  the  production  of  some</span><span>  choice  stock  in  our  young  and  prospering</span><span>  colony.  The  squatters  have  at  last  come  to</span><span>  the  conclusion  that  'the  breeding  of  good</span><span>  horses  pays  as  well  as  cattle  or  sheep,  and</span><span>  are  now  directing  their  attention  more</span></p> <p><span>  towards  the  breeding  of  such  live  stock  than</span><span>  hitherto,  which  will  not  only  benefit  them</span><span>  selves,  iat  also  the  colony,  as,  vben  they</span><span>  are  in  a  position  to  satisfy  the  market,  the</span><span>  thousands  of  pounds  that  are  monthly  re</span><span>  mitted  to  New  Sooth  Wales  will  stop  here.</span><span>  Thomas  Bell.

"<p><span>  THE  WAS  IN  NEW  ZEALAND.</span></p> <p><span>  (Frran  Correspondent  S.  if.  Herald.)</span></p> <p><span>  A  uckland.  6th  October.  I</span></p> <p><span>  Since  the  date  of  my  last  communication</span><span>  there  has  been  nothing  going  on  at  the</span><span>  front  of  very  striking  interest.  No  move</span><span>  has  yet  been  made  against  the  native</span><span>  stronghold  at  Meremere,  although,  so  far  as  i</span><span>  I  can  judge,  there  seems  every  prospect  of  a</span><span>  move  in  that  direction  within  the  nest  ten</span><span>  days.  Two  things  seem  to  have  delayed</span><span>  the  General  more  than  all  others  ;  and  these</span><span>  are,  the  determination  he  had  so  wisely</span><span>  come  to  not  to  make  Meremere  an  isolated</span></p> <p><span>  operation,  bnt  merely  the  first  step  in  his</span><span>  subjugation  of  the  whole  Waikato  country,</span><span>  to  be  prosecuted  without  any  intervening</span><span>  delay,  so  that  the  natives  might  find  that</span><span>  they  bad  no  time  to  recover  from  the  stun</span><span>  ning  effects  of  a  severe  blow,  such  as  will</span><span>  certainly  be  attempted  at  Meremere,  before</span><span>  their  whole  country  is  in  the  hands  of  the</span><span>  invader.  Aud  tlie  second  reason  seems  to</span><span>  bave  been  that  he  was  willing  to  wait  any</span><span>  jBaasonable  time  in  the  hope  that  the  patiTO</span><span>  »  tt^F^itfc  ft'ra'to  Etrtte*  a%l?w  tii'ere.</span><span>  such  as  never  yet  has  been  struck  iu  the</span><span>  annals  of  New  Zealand  warfare.  Could</span><span>  be  bnt  get  2000  Naoiies  collected  there,</span><span>  with  the  preparations  which  he  now  has</span><span>  perfected,  he  conld  probably  make  sure  of</span><span>  destroying  one  half  of  that  nnmber.  Such</span><span>  a  success,  even  if  purchased,  as  it  doubtless</span></p> <p><span>  would  be,  by  Uie  destruction  ot  many  ot  our</span><span>  men  (150  is  the  common  estimate  of  military</span><span>  men)  would  strike  at  the  root  of  the  rebel</span><span>  lion  at  once.  The  game  of  war  would  be</span><span>  pronounced  a  losing  one,  and  the  end  would</span><span>  be  sure  before  long.  '</span><span>  Whilst  there  were  some  eight  hundred</span><span>  Maories  away  from  Meremere  and  in  the</span><span>  bush  to  the  rear  of  the  General's  'position,</span><span>  it  was  clearly  a  matter  of  impra  ability  far</span><span>  the  numbers  at  Meremere  to  amount  to  any</span><span>  thing  like  enough  to  defend  it.  An  attack</span><span>  would,  therefore,  only  have  led  to  the  immo  -</span><span>  diato  flight  of  the  natives,  and  thus  the  beat</span><span>  —perhaps  the  only  thoroughly  good  chance</span><span>  of  bringing  the  natives  so  to  bay  as  to  en-e</span><span>  sure  aheavy  loss  tothemontheirdefcat,tohe,</span><span>  got  during  the  present  war  would  bave  been</span><span>  thrown  away.  The  reason  for  shortly  ex</span><span>  pecting  a  move  is  that  now  the  principal</span><span>  objections  to  it  are  removed,  as  far  as  we</span><span>  can  hope  for  their  removal  for  some  time  to</span><span>  come.  All  is  now  ready  for  an  advance  np</span><span>  the  Waikato  as  soon  as  Meremere  shall</span><span>  bare  {alien.  There  are  2000  of  her  Majes</span><span>  ty's  troops  massed  at  the  front,  who  can  now</span><span>  be  moved  on  without  anyfaindrance  as  soon</span><span>  as  it  aeem««o6d  to  the  General.  The  pro</span><span>  vision  made  Tor  tbe  Cbrert  district  commit</span><span>  tea  -t-  v  theGonerBl  Oameron}  to  Colonel</span><span>  Kixon  has.  it  ippearB.  resulted  In  the  re</span><span>  treat  of  nearly  sfi  the  force  lately  occupying</span><span>  that  dUtriet,  mtou  tha  Walluto,  ana  »  &</span></p> <p><span>  reasonably  supposed  that  these-  bave  Te</span><span>  joined  the  wain  body  at  Meremere,  so  that</span><span>  once  more  the  force  there  must  amount  to</span><span>  at  least  twelve  or  fifteen  hundred  men.  The</span><span>  weather  also  is  greatly  improved,  and  I  can</span><span>  not  conceive  the  General's  being  willing  to</span><span>  waste  a  clay's  fine  weather  as  he  has.  I</span><span>  fancy,  afuli  summer's  campaign  Lcfore  him</span><span>  ere  the  natives  see  the  hopelessness  of  the</span><span>  straggle  they  now  wage.</span><span>  These  arc  all  reasons  fonnded  upon  pro</span><span>  bability  ;  but  I  have  some  others  irhich</span><span>  may  r-itber  bo  denominated  signs  of  the</span><span>  General's  intentions  than  reasons  of  tnv</span><span>  own.</span><span>  Tiie  General  has  become  tired  of  waiting</span><span>  for  the  arrival  of  a  number  of  large  boats,</span><span>  and  others,  wliiclypere  tojbrm  gunboats  for</span><span>  thc^ttack  on  Afgrcmerc  ;  and  a  day  mr  two</span><span>  ago  all  flie  largest  wlialeboats  procurable  in</span><span>  and  around  Anckland  were  brought  np  and</span><span>  %uk&&mu*'M*mt  —  *—  '--  -  ?</span><span>  The  troops  have  been  Biassed  at  tlie</span><span>  front  for  some  time,  but  during  the  last  few</span><span>  days  a  large  number  of  local  troops,</span><span>  amongst  which  are  '%ome  companies  from</span><span>  Australia  of  the  military  settler  force,  bave</span><span>  been  gradually  drafted  forward  to  the</span><span>  Waikato.  All  the  Medical  staff,  both  or  the</span><span>  military  and  volunteers,  who  are  near  the</span><span>  front,  have  been  ordered  to  be  at  Pokeno  in</span><span>  tlie  course  of  a  day  or  two  ;  so  that  I  think</span><span>  there  is  ample  reason  for  looking  for  news  of</span><span>  importance  in  a  day  or  two.</span><span>  Howthis  may  be  affected  by  the  arrival  of</span><span>  the  long-expected  gnnboat  Waikato  from</span><span>  your  port,  tvliich  took  place  on  Sunday  last,</span><span>  in  company  with  the  Eclipse,  after  an  ex</span><span>  cessive  stormy  passage.

This  plan</span><span>  mutt  of  course  be  laid  before  the  Assembly</span><span>  when  it  meets,  but  I  feel  pretty  confident</span><span>  that  it  refers  cither  to  the  introduction  of</span><span>  some  thousands  of  trained  militiamen  from</span><span>  the  English  agricultural  counties,  or  to  a</span><span>  similar  scheme  with  regard  to  Prussian  im</span><span>  migrants,  all  of  whom  have  been  subjected</span><span>  to  a  three-year's  military  training.

At</span><span>  3.30  a.m.  on  that  morning,  the  two  compa</span><span>  nies  of  bushrangers  (Captain  Atkinson's</span><span>  and  Captain  Webster's)  left  town,  and  cros</span><span>  sing  the  Bell  Block,  lay  in  ambush  on  the</span><span>  run  beside  the  road  leading  from  Kaipako</span><span>  pako,  in  the  hopes  of  catching  any  natives</span><span>  who  might  be  coming  on  the  block  to  drive</span><span>  off  cattle,  or  to  murder  stray  pakchas.  some</span><span>  of  whom,  we  are  sorry  to  say,  are  still  rash</span><span>  and  foolish  enough  to  go  down  there  for</span><span>  cattle.  After  lying  there  till  about  9  a.m.,</span><span>  and  no  prey  appearing,  the  party  struck  in</span><span>  land,  and  on  emerging  from  a  piece  of  bush</span><span>  into  a  fern  patch(at  a  place  called  Borongia)</span><span>  the  advance  guard  discovered  a  party  of  15</span><span>  or  20  natives,  standing  near  together,  about</span><span>  200  yards  off.  besides  some  others  on  the</span><span>  edge  of  tlie  bush  on  the  left.  One  with  a</span><span>  sou'-wester  on,  who  seemed  to  be  their</span><span>  leader,  seeing  only  a  few  of  our  men,  rushed</span><span>  towards  them,  brandishing  his  gun.  appar</span><span>  ently  inciting  his  men  to  come  with  him,</span><span>  thinking  probably  he  had  got  some  fit  sub</span><span>  jects  for  murdering,  he,  uo  doubt  'changed</span><span>  his  mind,  however,  when  the  leading  section</span><span>  gave  him  a  volley  ;  for  he  turned  and  ran</span><span>  down  behind  a  little  ridge  and  fell,  but  must</span><span>  have  been  helped  away  into  the  bush  clnsa</span><span>  by  into  which  all  the  natives  went.  He  left</span><span>  bis  sou'-westar^nd  mat  stained  with  blood</span><span>  where  he  fell.  ^Another  irjsmut  as  be  was</span><span>  entering  the  bush.  When  in  the  bush  they</span><span>  began  firing,  and  kept  it  up  for  some  little</span><span>  time,  but  without  effect,  though  it  was  no</span><span>  ticed  that  they  shot  better  than  Maories</span><span>  commonly  do.  The  fire  was  returned  a</span><span>  long  as  it  lasted,  and  then  an  unsuccessful</span><span>  search  was  made  for  the  owner  of  the  sou's</span><span>  wester,  hut  Captain  Atkinson  did  not</span><span>  think  it  desirable  to  follow  them  np,  consi</span><span>  dering  the  large  force  known  to  be</span><span>  in  the  neighbourhood,  aiid  the  Bush</span><span>  rangers,  therefore,  proceeded  on  their  way,</span><span>  —  Captain  Webster's  company  now  .taking</span><span>  the  lead.  Ou  reaching  Greenway's  clearing</span><span>  three  Maories  were  seen  by  the  advanced</span><span>  i-na^andar.aaplatB  Messenger  on  tbo  left</span><span>  W^oVtiage^vcriooking  the  Mangoraka,</span><span>  and  these  were  shortly  joined  by  b«k  more</span><span>  This  was  commnnieated  to  Captain  Webster,</span><span>  who  immediately  ordered  a.  charge,  and</span><span>  while  the  men  were  advancing  at  the  double</span><span>  they  received  a  volley  from  the  nine  and</span><span>  also  from  a  party  in  the  bush  to  the  left,  bnt</span><span>  no  harm  was  done,  though  again  there  were</span><span>  some  narrow  escapes.  After  firing,  the  na</span></p> <p><span>  tives  fled  precipitately  down  the  banks  and</span><span>  across  the  Mangoraks,  though  not  with  im</span><span>  punity  as  was  evinced  by  blood-stained  mats</span><span>  and  shawls  left  behind  them,  and  one  man</span><span>  was  seen  to  bo  dragged  up  the  other  bank</span><span>  of  the  river.  They  also  left  a  bag  of  bul</span><span>  lets,  a  box  of  caps,  and  a  kit  of  food  con</span><span>  taining,  among  other  things,  some  tempting</span><span>  fconja  pirau.  It  is  probable  that  these  ua</span><span>  tives  were  on  the  look-out  for  the  partyfrem</span><span>  tn'e'BeirsticMiotiBo  who  come  there  *br</span><span>  firewood  (and  who  indeed  arrived  there</span><span>  about  twenty  n»uv4»«  ?&**  *l»  eLLwuJ^..</span><span>  and  thev  were  therefore  .very  opportunely</span><span>  disturbea.  It  is  probable  also  that  the  first</span><span>  party  fallen  npon  were  intended  to  co</span><span>  operate.

After  this,  fighting  was  very</span><span>  sharp  here  fur  some  time,  the  enemies  being</span><span>  in  great  t,  mnbers  in  the  hush  all  round,  and</span><span>  also  on  Allen's  hill,  from  which  latter  place,</span><span>  however,  thev  were  vciy  soon  driven.  In</span><span>  places  the  soldiers  »nd  natives  were  oc</span><span>  casionally  only  a  few  yards  apart,  and</span><span>  Captain  Shortt's  party  were  very  hardly</span><span>  pressed  until  the  arrival  of  the  volunteers,</span><span>  who  upon  coming  to  the  scene  of  action  (by</span><span>  the  old  road  across  the  Waireka  gnllyj,</span><span>  where  immediately  extended  along  the  little</span><span>  ridge  at  right  'angles  to  the  road,  and</span><span>  overlooking  Gilbert's  Garden,  in  which  a</span><span>  great  many  of  the  natives  were.  This  drew</span><span>  off  a  considerable  part  of  the  fire  from  Cap</span><span>  tain  Khortt.  and  enabled  him,  after  sending</span><span>  in  his  wounded,  to  join  the  main  body.</span><span>  This  left  the  volunteers  on  the  left  front  ;</span><span>  after  a  few  minutes  they  got  the  word  to</span><span>  retire  behind  the  next  rise,  where  they  re</span><span>  mained  perhaps  an  hour.  Here  they  re</span><span>  ceived  some  very  heavy  volleys,  knocking</span><span>  up  the  ground  and  whistling  overhead,  bnt</span><span>  doing  no  harm  ;  there  were  also  some  fair</span><span>  single  shots  from  rifles.  After  a  while  Cap</span><span>  tain  Atkinsou'a  company  was  withdrawn,</span><span>  and  left  Captain  Webster's  alone  behind  a</span><span>  hedge  to  draw  the  natives  on,  bnt  this  they</span><span>  seemed  disclined  for,  though  a  good  many</span><span>  shots  were  exchanged.  Some  notion  of  the</span><span>  number  of  the  enemy  may  be  gained  from</span><span>  the  fact  they  extended  from  Fort  Roberta</span><span>  (Ranginru)*  right  ronnd  to  Touet's  place.  A</span><span>  little  howitzer  practice  was  made  upon  them</span><span>  near  the  former  place.</span><span>  What  the  Maori  loss  has  been  it  wonld  be</span><span>  impossible  to  sa}'-  Several  were  seen  down.</span></p> <p><span>  and  ire  have  no  doubt  they  suffered  heavily.</span><span>  or  two  reasons  —  because  our  men  fire  much</span><span>  more  cooly,  and  mnch  better  than  the</span><span>  Maories.  and  because  the  hitter  ceased  firing</span><span>  when  we  did  ;  and  because  they  did  not  at</span><span>  tempt  tojoppose  the  recrossing  Waireka</span><span>  gully,  as  they  certainly  would  nave  oono</span><span>  had  they  been  in  good  spirits.</span><span>  Colonel  Warre,  who  was  personally  in</span><span>  command  during  the  engagement,  directing</span><span>  the  various  movements,  after  it  was  over</span><span>  thanked  the  Volunteers  for  the  important</span><span>  help  they  had  rendered  him,  complimenting</span><span>  them  on  the  orderly  and  prompt  way  in</span><span>  which  they  executed  the  orders  tbey  received.</span><span>  He'was  'only  sorry  be  had  not  men  enough</span><span>  to  follow  the  enemy  up,'  and  we  an</span><span>  certain  that  nothing  would  have  pleased</span><span>  officers  and  men  better  if  the  gallant  Colonel</span><span>  had  been  in  a  position  to  let  them  make  ?-</span><span>  closer  acquaintance  with  the  enemy.</span><span>  The  following  is  a  list  of  the  casualties  on</span><span>  our  side.

During</span><span>  the  forenoon  the  sun  was  intensely  hot,  and</span><span>  about  three  o'clock  the  sky  began  to  lower,</span><span>  and  thunder  pealled  forth.  Tlie  hail  com</span><span>  menced  to  fall  with  all  the  fury  of  an  tngry</span><span>  element  and  the  force  of  cannon  balls,  some</span><span>  of  the  particles  berng  as  large  as  small  hen</span><span>  eggs.  The  storm  continued  about  an  hour,</span><span>  and  several  windows  and  skv-lisrhts  were</span></p> <p><span>  smashed,  and  property  damaged.  Another</span><span>  unpleasant  casuality  happened,  —  Mr.  tras</span><span>  kirtb's  new  store  came  down  with  a  terrific</span><span>  smash  ;  happily  no  loss  of  life  occurred.</span><span>  Five  little  boys  who  took  shelter  from  the</span><span>  storm  under  a  culvert  in  the  Corporation</span><span>  Yard,  wonld.  only  for  the  timely  interven</span><span>  tion  of  one  of  their  mothers.  Mrs.  Lewis  of</span><span>  South-street,  have  been,  it  appears,  victims</span><span>  to  tire  fury  of  the  storm.  There  was  no</span><span>  water  in  the  cnircrt  at  the  time  they  entered</span><span>  it.  and  some  obstruction  being  at  tile  mouth  1</span><span>  of  the  culvert  prevented  the  gradual  course  '</span><span>  and  rise  of  the  water,  until  all  of  a  sudden</span><span>  the  force  of  water  broke  the  obstacle,  and</span><span>  the  water  rushed  ia  with  all  its  force  and</span><span>  fury  down,  and  out  were  dashed  the  poor</span><span>  little  fellows,  rolling  like  balls  before  the</span><span>  maddening  spray.  Great  credit  is  dne  to</span><span>  the  heroic  pronip'itude  of  Btrs.  Lewis,</span><span>  who  was  then  at  the  mouth  of  the  culvert.</span><span>  Sbe  seized  three  of  the  boys  by  the  hair,</span><span>  and  her  screams  brought  timely  assistance</span><span>  to  save  the  other  two  from  a  water}-  grave.</span><span>  Another  minute  would  have  sent  the  last</span><span>  little  fellow  into  the  pond  in  the  middle  of</span><span>  the  paddock,  from  which  no  efforts  could</span><span>  save  1um.  Ths  thunderstorm  commenced</span><span>  again  about  1  o'clock  a.m.  on  Friday  by</span><span>  the  most  terrific  squalls  of  wind  and  rain.</span><span>  Few  ever  remember  to  have  heard  such</span><span>  thunder;  it  did  not  cease  till  about  half-past</span><span>  four,  and  allowed  few  t--  sleep  during  its</span><span>  continuance.  To-day  is  felt  by  everyone</span></p> <p><span>  to  be  most  sultry,  and  it  is  to  be  feared  that</span><span>  we  shall  have  another  storm.  The  ther</span><span>  mometer  stands  at  105  in  the  bud.  Half-past</span><span>  one,  the  heat  very  oppressive.</span><span>  There  is  great  apathy  this  year  about  the</span><span>  Christmas  races.  Tksre  seems  to  be  no</span><span>  move  as  yet  either  with  regard  to  the  funds</span><span>  or  the  appointment  of  stewards.  I  would</span><span>  humbly  submit  that,  if  we  are  to  have  the</span><span>  races,  there  is  no  time  to  be  lost.  It  is</span><span>  giving  a  very  short  notice  to  gentlemen  to</span><span>  put  their  horses  into  training.  I  hope,  for</span><span>  the  honor  or  tl-»  Ipswich  sporting  rraternity,</span><span>  this  customary  source  of  amusement  will</span><span>  not  be  suffered  to  die  a  natural  death.  I</span><span>  heard  by  chance,  since  writing  the  above,</span><span>  that  the  Mayor  has  signified  his  intention</span><span>  of  calling  a  meeting  in  the  School  of  Arts</span><span>  to  take  steps  fur  the  appointment  of  stew</span><span>  ards.  Better  late  than  never.</span><span>  If  the  liberty  of  the  press  werein  the  hands</span><span>  of  some  people,  we  wonld  very  soon  have  all</span><span>  sorts  of  despotism.  It  is  not  at  all  conve</span><span>  nient  for  the  evil  deeds  of  some  men  to  be</span><span>  dragged  forth  into  public  light,  especially  if</span><span>  the  things  of  which  they  are  charged  pub</span><span>  licly,  and  in  their  public  capacity,  cannot</span><span>  be  very  well  answered.  This  seems  to  be  th»</span><span>  case  with  a  worthy  dignitary  of  this  town.</span><span>  A  ratepayer  wrote  a  few  letters  to  tbe  North</span><span>  Australian,  accusing  him  of  certain  question</span><span>  able  proceedings  connected  with  his  conduct</span><span>  as  s  public  man.  He  answered  the  first</span><span>  Utter,  denying  the  chaises,  but  another</span><span>  letter  appeared  stating  that  the  writer  could</span><span>  prove  by  respectable  witnesses  the  truth  of.</span><span>  the  charges  advanced.  To  this  stickler  no</span><span>  answer  was  retuencd  by  the  accused,  but  a</span><span>  polite  note  from  his  amanuensis  with  hit  men</span><span>  tignaturt  was  sent  to  the  journal,  stating  that</span><span>  he  wouid  decline  lor  tbe  future  being  a  sub</span><span>  scriber.  The  gentleman  ought  to  know  that</span><span>  if  he  wished  to  disprove  the  charges  alleged</span><span>  against  him,  the  columns  of  the  North  Aus</span><span>  tralian,  as  an  independent  paper,  were  open  to</span><span>  him,  as  well  as  totne  gentleman  whothougbt</span><span>  fit,  and  who  as  a  citizen  had  a  perfect</span><span>  right  to  criticize  his  public  conduct.  Let</span><span>  this  gentleman  if  he  cannot  relish  the  idea</span><span>  of  having  his  public  conduct  dualized  re</span><span>  tire  into  obscurity  for  the  remainder  of  his</span><span>  days,  and  regret  that  he  should  ever  have</span><span>  had  the  misfortnne  to  aspire  to  a  position</span></p> <p><span>  for  which  besfaoirs  himself  otterly  unquali</span><span>  fied.

The  usual  hour  Ihrooghoat  her</span><span>  Majesty's  dominions  is  12  a.m.,  bnt  (he</span><span>  institution  of  an  earlier  hour  is  certainly</span><span>  advisable  in  latitndes  where  the  hour  of  noon</span><span>  is  announced  by  a  vertical  sun.  Tiie  Anni</span><span>  versary  was  tbe  wannest  day  of  the  season.</span><span>  The  sun  shone  in  pitiless  majesty,  and  the</span><span>  pleasure-seekers  distilled  copious  perspir</span><span>  ation  in  obedience  to  his  mandate.  The  ab</span><span>  sence  of  tbe  sea  breeze  for  the  last  few  days</span><span>  has  roost  sensibly  heightened  the  tempera</span><span>  ture;  and  to  read  of  hailstones  two  or  three</span><span>  inches  long  and  of  proportionate  diameter</span><span>  falling  in  Ipswich  and  vicinity  is  almost  as</span><span>  refreshing  as  a  '  slierrv  cobbler'  or  an  iced</span><span>  lemonade.  But  notwithstanding  the  heat,</span><span>  nur  community  managed  to  enjoy  themselves.</span><span>  The  steamer  Settler  made  an  excursion  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  Bay.  and  great  was  the  festivity  pro</span><span>  railing  on  board.  Tbey  got  the  fallest</span><span>  benefit  of  the  hreeze,  which  was  quickened</span><span>  by  tbe  rapid  passage  of  the  vessel.  And  the</span><span>  folks  from  the  cottntry  made  their  appear</span><span>  ance  in  town  in  holiday  attire.  Little  urchins</span><span>  were  here  on  their  first  trip,  gazing  at  tbe</span><span>  wonders  of  the  City  they  had  never  seen  be</span><span>  fore,  and  all  nature,  from  the  scorching  sun</span><span>  beam  to  the  little  (note  which  danced  therein,</span><span>  seemed  filled  with  British  loyalty,  and  elo</span><span>  qnent  in  proclaiming  the  Natal  Day  of  the</span><span>  heir  to  England's  Cnnrn.  This  tribute  of  a</span><span>  distant  province  to  tbe  heir  of  a  linndred</span><span>  crowns  is  indeed  a  desideratum  worthy  of</span><span>  princely  ambition.</span><span>  On  Satnrday  the  7th  inst.  tbe  body  of  an</span><span>  able  seaman  of  the  Snldanhs,  who  met  Iiis</span><span>  death  by  the  capsizing  of  the  yacbt  Water</span><span>  witch,  belonging  to  Captain  Bragg  of  the</span><span>  Sonda,  was  picked  np-  at  Nonuan'a  Creek.</span><span>  The  body  was  in  n  far  advanced  state  of  de</span><span>  composition,  and  was  interred  during  (he</span><span>  afternoon.

This  is  not  as  it</span><span>  should  be.  While  interested  parties  wait</span><span>  for  one  man,  their  own  interests  are  likely</span><span>  to  suffer.

Mr.</span><span>  Sullivan  said  that  he  had  been  misinformed</span><span>  upon  the  subject,  and  by  an  individual  whom</span><span>  he  thought  better  informed  than  himself:  he</span></p> <p><span>  had  understood  that  the  licence  day  was</span><span>  next  Tuesday.  The  Police  Magistrate  said</span><span>  it  was  fortunate  that  on  the  previous  day</span><span>  court  had  only  adjourned  to  its  present  sit-</span><span>  ting,  so  that  the  license  could  be  then</span><span>  granted;  but  the  Chief  Constable  having</span><span>  stated  that  the  house,  although  fit  and  pro-</span><span>  per  in  every  other  respect,  was  not  finished,</span><span>  the  licence  would  be  granted  conditionally  ;</span><span>  and  during  the  ensuing  ten  days  he  (the</span><span>  Police  Magistrate)  would  visit  the  house</span><span>  himself,  and  if  he  approved  of  it,  the  licence</span><span>  would  be  granted  absolutely.</span><span>  The  London  correspondent  of  'Bell's  Life  in  Victoria',  in  referring  to  the  challenge</span><span>  entrusted  to  Mr.  Walter  Craig,  states  :--  ""  I  wish  I  could  hold  out  to  you  any  hopes  of</span><span>  the  challenge  offered  by  your  colony  for</span><span>  England  to  run  a  match  at  Melbourne  for</span><span>  £5000,  being  accepted.  There  ia  no  proba</span><span>  bility  of  its  being  taken  np,  simply  because</span><span>  no  owner  of  a  first-class  racehorse  wonld</span><span>  rnu  the  risk,  more  especially  as  he  wonld</span><span>  have  neither  honor  nor  profit  to  gain.

Verily  it  would  have  been  a  sight</span><span>  worth  seeing  to  any  British  subject</span><span>  who  has  hitherto  been.  sceptical</span><span>  in  regard  to  the  present  progress  aad  per</span><span>  manent  establishment  and  prosperity  of</span><span>  tbo  colony  of  Queensland,  to  have  spont</span><span>  tbe  day  amongst  the  thousands  of  inde</span><span>  pendent  inhabitants  of  Brisbane  with  their</span><span>  blithe  contented  looks.  All  national  anni</span><span>  versaries  are  landmarks,  as  it  were,  fruin</span><span>  which  the  thinking  mind  and  mature  Judg</span><span>  ment  view,  review,  and  compare  existing</span><span>  facts,  and  determine  their  general  opinion</span><span>  in  relation  to  the  whole.  Up  to  the  day  we</span><span>  now  speak  of,  truly  that  review  must  have</span><span>  been  delightful.  Nature,  art,  enterprise,</span><span>  capital,  and  genius  have  all  combined  to</span><span>  tduce  order  ont  of  chaos,  and  to  impart  the</span><span>  verdure  and  tbe  fragrance  of  a  very  Eden  to</span><span>  this  once,  and  not  long  since,  Australian</span><span>  wild.  But,  while  feeling  every  reason  of</span><span>  gratitude  to  a  beneficent  providence  for  its</span><span>  manifold  blessings  in  our  favor,  we  feel</span><span>  that  misrule  has  had  no  small  interest  in</span><span>  clogging  the  wheels,  and  in  retarding  the</span><span>  onward  march  of  onr  progress.  Jlefonn</span><span>  may  be,  and  is  talked  of,  and  projected  ;  bnt</span><span>  reform  -will  not  blot  ont  the  past,  or  make</span><span>  amends  for  its  errors.  It  is  indeed  true  that</span><span>  we  have  progressed  -much,  and  in  the  right</span><span>  direction.

The  Captain  said</span><span>  that  his  principal  witnesses  being  passen-</span><span>  gers,  had  left  Brisbane,  therefore  the  charge</span><span>  could  not  be  supported  against  the  prisoners,</span><span>  who  were  thereupon  discharged.</span><span>  If  we  are  to  believe  common  report,  com-</span><span>  bined  as  it  has  been  of  late  with  something</span></p> <p><span>  tangible,  it  is  evident  Queensland  will  not</span><span>  belong  without  her  payable  gold-fields.</span><span>  Then  are  at  present  to  he  seen  is  the</span><span>  establishment  of  Flavelle  Brothers,  Queen-</span><span>  street,  12  ounces  of  gold  crashed  from</span><span>  quartz,  the  produce  of  the  Talgai  gold-field,</span><span>  and  that  field  has  an  inexhaustible  supply</span><span>  of  gold  producing  quartz,  requiring  nothing</span><span>  but  the  necessary  machinery  to  compel</span><span>  the  matrix  to  yield  up  its  auriferous  pro-</span><span>  duct.  The  accounts  from  the  Peak  Downs,</span><span>  Caliope,  and  other  diggings  to  the  North-</span><span>  ward  are  decidedly  favorable,  and  we  flatter</span><span>  ourselves  that  the  day  is  not  far  distant</span><span>  when  the  export  of  raw  gold  from  Queens-</span><span>  land  will  not  be  far  behind  that  from  other</span><span>  gold  producing  colonies.</span></p> <p><span>  A  SOMEWHAT  novel  case  was  brought</span><span>  under  the  notice  of  the  Police  Bench  yester-</span><span>  day.  Two  men  and  a  female  were  charged</span><span>  with  assaulting  constable  Sherman.  It  ap-</span><span>  peared  that  the  constable  in  plain  clothes</span><span>  went  up  to  some  individuals  who  were</span><span>  fighting  in  George-street,  and  offered  to</span><span>  become  stakeholder  for  £10  or  £14,  a  pri»</span><span>  to  be  fought  tor  the  following  morning;</span><span>  this  course  he  adopted,  according  to  his</span><span>  statement,  to  obtain  the  names  of  the  combatants,  but  finding  himself  failed  in  this</span><span>  attempt,  he  laid  hold  on  one  of  the  men,  who</span><span>  assaulted  him.  which  was  followed  up  by</span><span>  assaults  on  the  part  of  the  other  man  and</span><span>  the  female;  whereupon  he  drew  his  baton</span><span>  and  struck  one  of  the  men.  Some  discus-</span><span>  sion  ensued  as  to  a  man  being  a  constable</span><span>  unless  in  uniform  ;  but  the  Chief  Constable</span><span>  maintained  that  a  constable  was  always  a</span><span>  constable  in  uniform  or  not,  and  circum-</span><span>  stances  occurred  in  which  constables  were</span><span>  ordered  upon  duty  in  plain  clothes.  Mr.</span><span>  Garrick,  for  prisoners,  maintained  that</span><span>  Sherman  and  prisoners  should  change</span><span>  places,  for  inducing  an  offence  in  offering  to</span><span>  be  stake-holder  in  a  fight,  and  drawing  his</span><span>  baton  when  in  plain  clothes,  and  striking</span><span>  one  of  the  prisoners.  The  Bench  having</span><span>  fined  each  of  the  prisoners  10s.  directed</span><span>  constable  Sherman  in  future  not  to  be  stake-</span><span>  holder  in  a  prize  fight,  but  stick  to  his  duty</span><span>  as  a  constable  ;  he  could  quell  a  riot  with-</span><span>  out  participating  in  it.</span></p> <p><span>  On  Thursday  evening,  a  lecture  by</span><span>  the  Rev.  B.  G.  Wilson  was  delivered  in  the</span><span>  School  of  Arts,  to  a  very  numerous  auditory.</span><span>  His  previous  lecture  had  been  upon  the</span><span>  genus  homo,  which  he  had  taken  at  rather  a</span><span>  low  estimate,  but  upon  the  present  occasion</span><span>  be  had  taken  for  his  lecture  '  Woman.'  He</span><span>  concluded  his  observations  with  some  re-</span><span>  marks  on  the  subject  of  female  education,</span><span>  which,  in  big  opinion,  should  be  encouraged</span><span>  and  fostered  by  the  State  to  a  greater  ex-</span><span>  tent  than  it  was  at  present.  A  vote  of</span><span>  thanks  having  been  given  to  the  lecturer,</span><span>  the  meeting  separated.</span><span>  FROG'S  Hollow,  from  the  deadly  vapours</span><span>  evolved  from  the  stagnant  waters  therein,</span><span>  has  been  justly  condemned  on  all  hands  as</span><span>  an  intolerable  nuisance.

(line  obscured)  ----  deposit  of  stagnant  green  water,  in  which</span><span>  the  bodies  of  numerous  dead  animals  were</span><span>  sweltering  in  the  sun,  and  giving  forth  the</span><span>  most  intolerable  exhalations.  A  few  loads</span><span>  of  earth  would  obviate  all  this,  and  render</span><span>  the  city  more  healthy.  These  pest  holes</span><span>  resemble  Pandora's  box,  with  this  significant</span><span>  difference,  that  instead  of  finding  Hope  yon</span><span>  find  Death  at  the  bottom.</span><span>  YESTERDAY,  Mr.  George  Lewis,  the  Chief</span><span>  Constable,  and  those  who  acted  with  him  in</span><span>  bringing  home  the  charge  of  robbery  in  a</span><span>  dwelling-house  to  one  Edward  Hartigan,</span><span>  received  the  thanks  of  the  Bench  through</span><span>  the  Chairman,  T.

M.  Herald'  has  the  subjoined</span><span>  remarks  on  the  position  taken  by  this  colony</span><span>  with  respect  to  the  Indo-Australian  line  :---</span><span>  Mr.  Cracknell  suggests  that  the  colonies</span><span>  should  jointly  guarantee  the  funds  for</span><span>  assisting  Queensland  to  carry  the  line  to</span><span>  the  Gulf  of  Carpentaria,  Since  the  date  of</span><span>  his  report,  however,  the  Queensland  Govern-</span><span>  ment  has  suspended  this  proposal  by  boldly</span><span>  proposing  to  undertake  the  whole  work  on</span><span>  its  own  account.  The  sum  of  £180,000  has</span><span>  been  placed  on  the  Estimates  for  that  pur-</span><span>  pose,  the  design  being  to  (coast?)  northwards</span><span>  as  far  as  Port  Denison,  and  there  to  strike</span><span>  across  to  the  Gulf.  The  Parliament  has  not</span><span>  yet  assented  to  this  estimate.  It  is  a  bold</span><span>  undertaking  for  so  young  a  colony,  but  there</span><span>  can  be  no  doubt  that  it  will  prove  indirectly</span><span>  if  not  directly  remunerative.  It  would  cer-</span><span>  tainly  precipitate  the  colonisation  of  Nor-</span><span>  thern  Australia  .  The  only  doubt  we  have</span><span>  as  to  the  policy  of  the  Queensland  Government  relates  to  the  route  chosen.  Instead</span><span>  of  clinging  to  the  coast  as  so  far  northward</span><span>  as  Port  Denison,  it  would  seem  a  more  likely</span><span>  course  to  facilitate  the  completion  of  the</span><span>  interior  if  the  line  struck  inland  through  the</span><span>  fine  pastoral  territory  now  known  to  exist.</span><span>  In  the  course  of  a  few  years,  however,</span><span>  there  will  probably  be  lines  by  both</span><span>  routes.</span></p> ",Article,1863-09-26,NOTES AND NEWS.,77436458,2,2,"{'score': '10.318091', 'value': 'very relevant'}","POLLING.—The polling for the election of two candidates to fil vacancies in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, will commence this morning, at nine o'clock p.m.","{'id': '264', 'value': 'The North Australian (Brisbane, Qld. : 1863 - 1865)'}",https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/77436458?searchTerm=%27The+North+Australian%27,/newspaper/77436458,"The North Australian (Brisbane, Qld. : 1863 - 1865)",264

The  society  was  formed  under  the</span><span>  auspices  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Bishop,  ana</span><span>  when  it  was  first  brought  under  bis  (the</span><span>  Colonial  Secretary's)  notice,  be  had  inti</span><span>  mated  that  although  at  that  time  the  Go</span><span>  vernment  did  not  feel  jnstified  in  inter</span><span>  fering  with  its  operations,  yet  the  Govern</span><span>  ment  wonld  feel  it  their  dnty  to  watch  the</span><span>  proceedings  of  the  society  with  great  jea</span><span>  lousy,  and  could  not  pledge  themselves  to  a</span><span>  sanction  of  the  society's  scheme,  nor  guaran</span><span>  tee  the  society  a  freedom  from  interference</span><span>  hereafter  on  the  part  of  the  Government</span><span>  The,  Government  had  subsequently  acted</span><span>  according  to  the  policy  in  connection  with</span><span>  tiie  society  then  laid  down;  aodhad  watched</span><span>  the  proceedings  of  the  association  with</span><span>  great  interest,  and  it  was  fortunate  that</span><span>  they  had  done  so.  From  time  to  time  as</span><span>  the  society  pnrased  its  operations  great</span><span>  complaints  from  the  immigrants  brought</span><span>  oat  ander  its  auspices  came  under  tiie  notice</span><span>  BsaWsaisaMIBMtl^fliliJmiS  .Government</span><span>  inhabitants  of  Iretttffl!^BPlw^WHSB</span><span>  countries  on  the  European  continent  ia</span><span>  bringing  them  ont  than  the  Emigration  So</span><span>  ciety  were.  The  Government  in  fact  could</span><span>  bring  out  the  immigrants  at  a  lower  cost  to</span><span>  themselves  and  the  immigrant  than  the</span><span>  Emigration  Society  could.  The  Govern</span><span>  ment  could  and  ought  to  keep  under  their</span><span>  control  the  expenditure  of  all  the  sums  of</span><span>  money  laid  ont  by  the  colony  in  inducing</span><span>  immigration.  But  with  snch  a  society  as</span><span>  the  Qneendand  Emigration  Society  in  ex</span><span>  istence  that  supervision  of  the  expenditure</span><span>  of  such  funds  could  not  be  maintained.</span><span>  There  were  other  difficulties  in  connection</span><span>  with  tiie  existence  of  snch  a  society,  and</span><span>  tiie  relation  in  which  it  stood  to  the  govern</span><span>  ment  Host  of  the  immigrants  brought  ont</span><span>  were  Roman  Catholics,  and  amongst  mem</span><span>  bers  of  that  church  thus  brought  out  there</span><span>  was  a  great  difficulty  in  many  instances  of</span><span>  procuring  the  necessary  baptismal  certifi</span><span>  cates,  and  sometimes  the  evidence  of  some</span><span>  friend  of  the  immigrant  was  all  that  was</span><span>  procurable.  Again  the  Government  had  no</span><span>  means  of  knowing  the  amount  of  donations</span><span>  ro*de  by  the  various  immigrants  to  tiie  so</span><span>  ciety.  Some  had  given  £8  previous  to  sail</span><span>  ing,  others  had  given  less.  He  asked  them</span><span>  why  should  the  Government  give  in  addition</span><span>  a  land  order  to  such  a  society?  Why</span><span>  should  Bishop  Quinn  receive  £8  from  the</span><span>  immigrant,  and  an  £18  land  order  from  the</span><span>  Government  for  giving  a  passage  to  this</span><span>  colony  which  only  cost  him  from  £14  to£15,</span><span>  when  the  Government  were  perfectly  will</span><span>  ing  to  bring  out  the  same  immigrantunder</span><span>  proper  arrangements  for  the  sum  of  £6  (?)</span><span>  Why,  in  fact,  shonld  the  Government  virtu</span><span>  ally  give  £21  for  the  individual  introduced</span><span>  by  the  society,  -when  they  could  bring  him</span></p> <p><span>  jut  for  £8.  The  Queensland  Society,  had</span><span>  no  doubt  done  its  work  well,  and  he  would</span><span>  lay  nothing  on.  that  head.  Bat  the  immi</span><span>  gration  under  its  anspices  hai  been  very</span><span>  xpensive  to  the  colony.  He  beard  also</span><span>  that  not  only  did  the  immigrants  who  came</span><span>  ont  under  the  Society's  auspices,  pay  sums</span><span>  of  from  £8  and  under,  previous  to  sailing,</span><span>  bat  that  many  of  these  same  immigrants</span><span>  after  their  aarrival  gare  promissory  notes</span><span>  as  part  payment  of  their  passages.  He</span><span>  would  remark  that  he  much  doubted  whe</span><span>  ther  tiie  Society  stood  in  need  of  ail  these</span><span>  funds  which,  in  the  manner  mentioned,  it</span><span>  bad  received.  If  they  were  distinctly  as</span><span>  sured,  as  they  had  been,  that  there  were</span><span>  on  aayterms,  It-wis  nnwise  poliey  to  ins</span><span>  tain  a  system  of  immigration  by  which  a</span><span>  private  society  reaped  profit  at  the  expense</span><span>  both  of  the  immigrant  and  the  Government.</span><span>  After  referring  to  a  cUuse  in  the  original</span><span>  report,  with  respect  to  the  right  of  the</span><span>  Queensland  Emigration  Society  to  tiie  im</span><span>  migrant's  Und  orders,  tin  boa.  gentleman</span><span>  proceeded  to  refer  to  his  communications</span><span>  with  the  representatives  of  that  society</span><span>  whilst  he  was  in  England.

He  imme</span><span>  diately  intimated  to  Doctor  Qrnnn</span><span>  (of  Harconrt-street,  Dublin),  that,  in</span><span>  future  he  (Dr.  Qoinn)  most  not  send  out</span><span>  emigrants  except  through  Mr.  Jordan,  Dr.</span><span>  Quinn  remonstrated  oh4he  ground*  that  he</span><span>  had  entered  into  negotiations  with  Mveral;</span><span>  families,  to  bring  them  oat  under  the</span><span>  Society's  anspices;  and  snch  negotiations</span><span>  ?would  be  defeated  by  this  new  regulation;</span><span>  *suifl  be  stated  that  engagements  were  pend*</span><span>  ing  between  400  and  600  persons.

Dr.  Qninn  (of  Dublin),  made  a  ]</span><span>  variety  of  ingenious  proposals.

In  applying  for</span><span>  this  committee,  he  had  disavowed  all  party</span><span>  intentions  ;  he  simply  desired  to  see  some</span><span>  scheme  introduced  which*wonld  be  an  im-  I</span><span>  proveraent  in  the  government  scheme,  and</span><span>  find  favour  with  both  sides  of  the  House.</span><span>  It  had  not  succeeded  entirely;  this  fact</span><span>  was  perhaps  attributable  to  the  circumstance</span><span>  that  tiie  majority  of  the  committee  were</span><span>  government  supporters.  There  were  many</span><span>  clauies  if  the  report  with  which  he  agreed  ;</span><span>  and  be  had  endeavoured  so  to  draft  die  report</span><span>  so  as  to  hit  the  views  of  the  majority  of  the</span><span>  member*  of  the  committ'je.

Tea,  that  is  the  instruc</span><span>  tion  issued  to  the  steerage  immigrants,  and</span><span>  the  agents  with  whom  they  communicate  in</span><span>  the  first  instance.  I  expUined  that  that</span><span>  was  done  with  the  full  consent  of  tiie  immi</span><span>  grant,  who  declares  that  he  voluntarily  fore</span><span>  mM  the  Manna1  land  order.  19.  I  under</span></p> <p><span>  stand  you.  that  it  is  perfectly  legal  and</span><span>  justifiable  to  dictate  terms  to  the  immigrant</span><span>  if  he,  agreeably  to  the  Act  pays  his  own</span><span>  passage  ?  I  take  it,  the  regulation  applies</span><span>  forego  their  second  land  order,  shonld  have</span><span>  ?  priority  of  ship;  if  we  could  not  get  per</span><span>  sons  willing  to  do  so.  we  shonld  have  to</span><span>  give  them  their  second  laud  order;  but  as</span><span>  there  U  an  unlimited  number  of  applicants</span><span>  for  passages,  on  condition  of  receiving  only</span><span>  one  land  order,  it  U  a  saving  to  tiie  colony</span><span>  of  thousands  of  pounds  to  take  those  firs</span><span>  who  voluntarily  forego  their  second  Und</span><span>  order.

Assuredly  not;  it  is</span><span>  mot  a  regulation  of  any  authority  whatever  ;</span><span>  it  is  a  brief  instruction  to  intending  immi</span><span>  grants,  and  is  of  no  legal  value,  nul-s»</span><span>  they  cobsect  21.  You  mean  to  say</span><span>  that  after  they  arrive,  notwithstanding</span><span>  this  regulation,  these  immi;rrauts  will</span><span>  be  entitled  to  demand  tiieir  Und  or</span><span>  ders,  agreeably  to  the  promuenTthe  Act?</span><span>  Unless  they  have  signed  a  declaration  to  the</span><span>  effect  that  they  will  forego  their  second  Und</span><span>  order.  22.  But  do  yon  consider  it  right  for</span><span>  the  Emigration  Agent  to  request  passengers</span><span>  paying  their  full  passage  to  sign  any  de</span><span>  elaration.  foregoing  their  right  to  part  of</span><span>  the  promises  contained  in  the  Act?  xes;  I</span><span>  think  it  very  right—  very  desirable.  23.</span><span>  Then  the  present  working  of  the  scheme,  as</span><span>  I  understand  from  what  you  say.  is  that  not</span><span>  only  aU  parties  receiving  assisted  passages</span><span>  are  required  to  sign  tin  declaration,  bnt  that</span><span>  no  oertficates  are  given  to  steerage  passen</span><span>  gers,  paying  their  full  passage,  unless  they</span><span>  sign  it?  xes.  so  long  as  there  are  a  suffi</span><span>  oient  number  forthcoming  willing  to  Bigs  it</span><span>  It  amounts  to  this—  that—  neither  I  nor  Mr.</span><span>  Jordan  could  «e  thecblouy  potto  thousands</span><span>  of  pounds  unnecessary  expense.'  if  the  per</span><span>  «ons  entailing  tint  expense  were  willing  to</span><span>  save  the  colony  «o  much.  24.  But  don't  you</span><span>  think  it  of  more  consequence  to  save  the</span><span>  promises  and  good  faith  than  even  the  cash</span><span>  of  the  country?  Certainly;  the  promises</span><span>  and  good  faith  of  the  country  are  fully  saved.</span><span>  The  arrangement  gives  ample  satisfaction</span><span>  to  parties  dealing  with  the  Government  It</span><span>  was  dear  from  this  evidence  that  the  Colo</span><span>  nial  SecretarVconsidered  that  die  parties</span><span>  bad  a  legal  olaim,  unless  they  were  willing</span><span>  to  voluntarily  forego  it  He  did  not  con</span><span>  ceive  that  the  Government  had  acted  rightly</span><span>  in  this  matter.

Mr.  Jordan  had  been  despatched</span><span>  to  forward  the  interests  of  Queens</span><span>  land,  and  he  presumed  that  gentleman</span><span>  dwelt  at  some  length  in  explaining  the</span><span>  privileges  conferred  by  a  residence  in  this</span><span>  colony.  Mr.  Jordan  had  been  opposed  by  a</span><span>  private  society—  the  Quoensland  Society—</span><span>  which  seemed  to  take  up  the  ground  and</span><span>  do  what  the  agent  had  failed  to  do.  It  ap</span><span>  peared  that  the  errand  of  the  hon.  the</span><span>  Calonial  Secretary  was  to  break  the  law</span><span>  which  had  been  laid  down.  If  they  passed</span><span>  a  Uw,  the  object  of  whicb  was  to  introduce</span><span>  a  number  of  immigrants  by  certain  induce</span><span>  ments,  it  was  auite  necessary  that  that  law</span></p> <p><span>  should  be  adhered  to.  He  could  not  endorse</span><span>  either  the  past  or  fnture  policy  of  the</span><span>  Government,  and  much  questioned  whether</span><span>  immigrants  could  not  lie  obtained  at  a</span><span>  cheaper  rate  than  was  now  proposed.  He</span><span>  agreed  with  the  assisted  immigration  sys</span><span>  tem.  It  appeared  that  tiie  sum  of  £16  18s,</span><span>  7d-  was  what  was  charged  by  the  Messrs.</span><span>  Baynes,  which  be  thought  was  too  much,</span><span>  be  contrasted  that  sum  with  the  avenge  for</span><span>  passages  to  New  South  Wales  and  Victoria,</span><span>  All  additional  charges  which  would  other</span><span>  wise  devolve  on  the  immigration  office,  were</span><span>  included  by  the  Messrs.  Baynes  in  the  addi</span><span>  tional  sum  of  £2  17s.  Now  Messrs.

From  tliiBit</span><span>  was  clear  either  that  Mr.  Jordan  was  a  bad</span><span>  man  of  business,  or  that  he  was  not  doing</span><span>  his  duty.  He  was  a  political  nroflieate.  like</span></p> <p><span>  the  hon.

I  think,  on  the  whole,  it</span><span>  would  be  better  not  to  resort  to  any</span><span>  snch  stimulus;  the  petty  frauds</span><span>  committed  in  .  the  transfer  of  land</span><span>  orders  by  those  who  undertake  that  busi</span><span>  ness  are  so  discreditable  to  the  colony,  that</span><span>  I  shonld  like  to  see  the  land  orders  cease</span><span>  to  be  transferable  for  tbat  reason  alone  ;</span><span>  and  I  think  the  laud  revenue  is  not  now  so</span></p> <p><span>  much  in  need  of  ench  a  stimulus  as  in  pre</span><span>  vious  years.'

As  regarded  the</span><span>  accommodation  offered  to  immigrants  on</span><span>  their  arrival,  he  (Mr.  Baff)  agreed  that  such</span><span>  complaints  were  often  frivolous,  hut  at  the</span><span>  same  time,  such  accommodation  might  be</span><span>  improved  without  detriment  to  the  reputa</span><span>  tion  of  the  colony.  As  regarded  tiie  21st</span><span>  clause  of  the  report  be  quite  concurred  in</span><span>  tiie  expression  of  opinion  that  the  operations</span><span>  of  such  societies  as  the  Queensland  Immi</span><span>  gration  Society,  concurrently  with  the</span><span>  government  immigration,  was  undeniable</span><span>  and  unnecessary.  At  the  same  time  be  be</span><span>  lieved  that  Bishop  Quinn  had  acted  with</span><span>  TBraSrlaocIety  whloh  he  thought  would</span><span>  be  to  the  advantage  of  the  colony.  Bishop</span><span>  Quinn  compUined  of  discourtesy  and  breach</span><span>  of  faith  on  the  part  of  the  gnvernmeut</span><span>  Whether  these  charges  wens  well  founded</span><span>  or  not  he  (Mr.  Raff}  had  not  suScient</span><span>  evidence  before  him  to  decide.</span><span>  Mr.  MACKENZIE  would  briefly  review</span><span>  the  clauses  and  give  his  opinion  thereon.</span></p> <p><span>  lie  aid  not  object  to  the  repeal  of  cisnse  18</span><span>  of  tiie  Act  as  recommended.  He  held  in  his</span><span>  band  a  pamphlet  issued  by  Mr.  Jordan,</span><span>  stating  that  £16  Und  orders  were  to  be</span><span>  given  to  all  immigrants  to  Queensland,  and</span><span>  certain  land  orders  to  soldiers  and  sailors..</span><span>  He  contended  that  the  Government  were</span><span>  bound  by  that  pamphlet  and  yet  he  could</span><span>  point  out  an  instance  which  bad  come  to  his</span><span>  knowledge  wherein  a  soldier,  having  all  his</span><span>  papers,  bad.  been  refused  his  Und.  This</span><span>  appeared  much  like  repudiation.  With  re</span><span>  gani  to  clause  6  be  bad  to  say  that  if  tiie</span><span>  system  were  adopted  it  would  be  better  to.</span><span>  giva  np  ibelend  order  system  at  ones.  If</span><span>  they  admitted  the  principle,  of  borrowing</span><span>  fin-  immigration,  the  revenue  anfierea.

He  had  never  agreed  with  the</span><span>  Queensland  or  any  similar  society,  bnt  be.</span><span>  ooold  not  aee,  by  the  clause  in  the  act  bow.</span><span>  any  restriction  could  be  placed  on  immigra</span><span>  tion  on  acconntof  nationality.  With  regard</span><span>  to  .tin  18th  clause,  he  could  .  not  aee</span><span>  how  the  people  of  any  nation  could  be  pre</span><span>  vented  emigrating  except  the  act  were  sir,</span><span>  tered.  Hedid  not  see  how  competition  could</span><span>  be  interfered  with  la  respect  of  the.  ships</span><span>  bringing  out  immigrants.  -  Both  the  Health,</span><span>  Officer  and  the  Emigration  Agent  werein</span><span>  ufBciently  paid,  *s  tiieir  'duties  bad  tn</span><span>  naseatenfold  of  Uteyan.  With  regard</span></p> <p><span>  fact  had  not  been  proved,  it  baa  merely</span><span>  been  asserted.  He  doubted  whether</span><span>  Baines  and  Company  would  introdnce  im</span><span>  migrants  te  the  colony  at  ss  cheap  a  rate  as</span><span>  Dr.  Qninn.  He  alluded  to  the  evidence  of</span><span>  Mr.  u'Carroll.  and  characterised  it  as  con</span><span>  trary  to  the  testimony  of  the  immigrants</span><span>  generally.  He  considered  that  it  would  be</span><span>  uselesB  to  expect  justice  from  a  house  com</span><span>  posed  of  twenty-six  members,  wbeu  it  was</span><span>  known  that  the  gaeat  success  of  Mr.  Jordan</span><span>  resulted  from  tiie  fact  tbat  be  had  Rood</span><span>  terms  to  offer.  He  was  able  to  offer  £30  in</span><span>  Iftad,  and  that  inducement  brought  izsmi</span><span>  grants  to  the  conntry.  He  protested</span><span>  against  the  monoply  that  was  established</span><span>  by  the  Colonial  Secretary  in  favor  of</span><span>  Bright  Brothers  and  Co.  ;  and  he  considered</span><span>  that  if  snch  societies  as  the  Queensland</span><span>  Association  were  encouraged,  emigrants</span><span>  would  be  bronght  out  at  a  cheaper  rate</span><span>  than  under  Mr.  Jordan's  regulations.  He</span><span>  proposed  as  an  amendment  that  the  fourth</span><span>  consideration  of  this  report  be  postponed</span><span>  until  after  the  passing  of  the  Loan  Bill.</span><span>  The  amendment  was  not  seconded,  and  the</span><span>  original  motion  tm  put  and  passed.</span><span>  MESSAGE  FKOM  THE  COUNCIL.</span><span>  The  SPEAKER  reported  the  Bank  of</span><span>  Queensland  Bill  from  the  Legislative  Coun</span><span>  cil,  for  the  concurrence  of  the  honse.</span><span>  OOVXBBHSKT  LOA2T  BILL.</span><span>  Jfc  MOFFiTT  minei  tbe  veennd  read</span><span>  ^a^o^Sa^vfeSSfe^^^S^</span></p> <p><span>  ?r.  niiiM-&jii  xruBtea  tuai  we  uuuse</span><span>  would  go  on  with  the  ftnuineet.</span><span>  Mr.  MACKENZIE  said  it  was  not  ad</span><span>  visable  to  go  on,  as*  tiie  members  were</span><span>  many  of  them  half  asleep.</span><span>  Mr.  MACALISTEB  woajd  go  on  with</span><span>  the  debate  until  6  o'clock  in  the  morning,</span><span>  if  necessary.</span><span>  Mr.  DOUGLAS  had  only  just  bad  the</span><span>  bill  placed  in  his  had.

Having  given  the  subject  mnch</span><span>  consideration,  and  finding  that  the  increase</span><span>  of  buyers,  and  the  progress  of  the  direct  ex</span><span>  port  trade  with  Great  Britain,  justify  the</span><span>  expectation  that  periodical  aales  in  the</span><span>  colony  would  be  of  great  advantage  to  the</span><span>  pastoral  intereBt  we  have  come  to  the  de</span><span>  termination  to  establish  a  Pastoral  Produce</span><span>  Market  in  Ipswich.</span><span>  In  soliciting  yonr  support  to  this  under</span><span>  taking,  we  Bhall  point  out  briefly  the  ad</span><span>  vantages  which  it  offers.

Gentlemen,  *</span><span>  Toot  obedient  Servant,</span><span>  £advestischeht.J</span><span>  TO  JAMES  HOUSTON.  Drayton.—</span><span>  Most  generous,  liberal,  and  noble</span><span>  minded  HOUSTON  !  Many  thanks  to  you</span><span>  for  the  neighbourly  spirit  you  have  displayed</span><span>  towards  me,  and  the  distribution  you  have  &nbsp;</span><span>  made  of  the  compulsory  gift  bestowed  on</span><span>  you  from  the  pockets  of  the  people  of</span><span>  Drayton  (including  myself),  on  the  strength</span><span>  of  her  Majesty's  warrant.  Now,  dear</span><span>  James,  in  the  distribution  of  this  aforesaid</span><span>  gift  you  have  acted  in  a  most  liberal  man-</span><span>  ner;  it  shows  you  are  in  favour  of  no</span><span>  particular  sect  or  creed,  inasmuch  as  you</span><span>  have  given  to  each  sect  of  the  three  denom-</span><span>  inations  an  equal  share  with  the  hospital.</span><span>  The  two  National  Schools  at  Drayton  and</span><span>  Toowoomba.  you  have  not  acted  so  gener</span><span>  ously  with—  you  have  divided  a  similar</span><span>  amount  to  that  which  you  gave  each  of  the</span><span>  others  between  them.  Now,  my  dear  James,</span><span>  this  was  wrong;  it  is  considered  you  should</span><span>  have  acted  more  liberally  with  the  School</span><span>  masters,  as  their  duties  are  very  hard  and</span><span>  troublesome  ;  you  should  have  known  this,</span><span>  particularly  as  you  are  a  family  man.  You</span><span>  most  know  the  great  trouble  and difficulty</span><span>  there  is  in  the  management  of  children;  but</span><span>  as  you  are  always  highminded  and  noble in</span><span>  your  acts,  you  consider  those  Schoolmasters</span><span>  as  second-raters,  and  therefore  they  must</span><span>  be  content  with  one-half.  Was  it,  my  dear</span><span>  James,  because  yon  did  not  get  all  you</span><span>  would  take  none  at  all—  that  you  acted  thus</span><span>  so  generously  with  one-half  the  spoil?  This</span><span>  is  the  current  belief  of  all  who  know  you.</span><span>  I  am  sure  it  is  not  for  love  of  those  sects</span><span>  you  have  acted  so  liberally,  for  it  is  a  well</span><span>  known  fact  that  you  never  wish  to  subscribe</span><span>  a  shilling  to  any  institution  in  the  country.</span><span>  In  this  instance  you  have  acted  very</span><span>  generously  with  other  people's  hard  earn-</span><span>  ings.  It  is  to  be  hoped  that  this  last  act  of</span><span>  yours  will  appease  your  wrath.  However</span><span>  this  spite  and  venom  got  the  better  of  you.</span><span>  I  cannot  say,  for  I  have  never  done</span><span>  you  harm.  I  did  not  consider  I</span><span>  was  touching  you  so  keenly  at  the</span><span>  time  when  I  helped  the  Council  to  get  from</span><span>  the  Government  the  land  whereon  the old</span><span>  pound-yard  stands,  and  whereon  is  your</span><span>  cabin.  Surely  you  have  had  the  place  long</span><span>  enough.  This  information  of  your  in  the</span><span>  police  court  was  poor  spite.  A  person's  hav-</span><span>  ing  acted  as  you  have  done  in  this matter is ????</span><span>  out  if  it  should  happen  that  my  business</span><span>  should  lead  me  out  after  dark  -  to  be</span><span>  guarded  against  the  dagger  of  an  assassin.</span><span>  If  you  are  not  generous  regarding  your  &nbsp;</span><span>  own  funds  in  subscribing  to  charitable  in-  &nbsp;</span><span>  stitutions,  one  thing  I  must  give  you  credit  &nbsp;</span><span>  for,  you  are  most  generous  in  snaring  the</span><span>  contents  of  the  bottle  when  you  are  under</span><span>  its  influence  —  when  you  are  concocting</span><span>  schemes  by  which  to  deceive  a  friend,  as</span><span>  you  did  at  the  late  election  for  Drayton  and</span><span>  Toowoomba.  It  is  well  known  what a token</span><span>  of  friendship  yon  can  give,  in  a  party  style,</span><span>  with  a  squeeze  of  the  hand,  and  a  wink  of</span><span>  the  eye  !  It  was  never  of  you  to make</span><span>  each  party  believe  you  were  their  friend  !</span><span>  Now,  my  dear  Houston,  I  am  quite  satis-</span><span>  fied  with  the  distribution's  you  have made,</span><span>  and  I  hope  it  may  benefit  those  parties</span><span>  you  have  been  graciously  pleased  to bestow it on.</span><span>  I  have  seen  in  the  columns  of the</span><span>  Darling  Downs  Gazette  your  name  signed  to</span><span>  documents  not  fit  to  be  read:  this  is very</span><span>  wrong  of  you,  enlightened  James Houston.</span><span>  I  would  advise  you  to  go  again  to school,</span><span>  and  learn  to  write  your  own  letters  ' this</span><span>  would  be  better  than  for  you  to  be  obliged</span><span>  to  go  to  that  old  scandal monger, the old</span><span>  hory-headed sinner who writes them for you.</span><span>  I  will  now  conclude,  hoping  the  few  re-  &nbsp;</span><span>  marks  I  have  made  will  be  for  your</span><span>  benefit.  One  thing  I  must  say,  as  I  have  &nbsp;</span><span>  subscribed so liberally  to the different  institutions previously named,  it is to  be hoped the  Principals will be  satisfied, and let me</span><span>  live  in  quietness  from any demands</span><span>  two or  three years-  or more,  if it  should please  Providence to  spare me.

Oaxettel</span><span>  O  siw  a  letter  signed  by  one  of  our  big</span><span>  in  -II.  A  ?nnng-.iHi-r  things  be  states  tbatelec</span><span>  t.is  ..r  Dravt..u  have  called  upon  Mr.Hand</span><span>  ciick  ro  resign,  he  forgets  to  say  that  the</span><span>  said  requisition  was  got  up  by  a  party  or</span><span>  cliqa  -  of  three  individuals,  who  went  round</span><span>  r  '.presenting  the  requisition  to  be  fora</span><span>  different  purpose  than  what  it  really  was.</span><span>  The  first  of  those  individuals  commenced</span><span>  this  because  some  act  of  the  Mayor's  helped</span><span>  to  touuh  his  pocket;  the  next  Wai  actuated</span><span>  by  a  disappointed  ambition,  and  some</span><span>  trifliri?  business  transactions;  the  other  was</span><span>  *a  influenced,  because  he  fancied  Die  Mayor</span><span>  b  id  addressed  him  as  number  one,  and  oon</span><span>  seqia..tly^  wai  very  indignant.  ?  Bo  t\he  is</span><span>  ?been  requested;  by  some  of  the  most  re</span><span>  spectable  inhabitants  of  the  town,  to  contra</span><span>  dict  several  statements  made  in  the  said</span><span>  letter.  First,  we  ?  know  the  real  author  of</span><span>  the  said  letter  to  be  an  adventurer,  who  has</span><span>  caused  more  dissensions  here,  since  he</span><span>  hone-red  u-  with  -his-  preSeoos.'  than  have</span><span>  occnrredinDraytonsinceitwas  formed.  This</span><span>  person  is  apparently  very  religions,  and  is</span><span>  an  office-bearer  —  I  am  sorry  he  does  not</span><span>  pay  mare  attention  to  the  reading  of  the</span><span>  Scriptures  and  practice  what  he  reads  there</span><span>  in;  but  those  who  are  made  cat's  paws  of  by</span><span>  him  are  more  to  blame,  men  who  have</span><span>  hitherto  been  respected  in  the  town,  but</span><span>  who.  I  am  sorry  to  say,  have  lost  all</span><span>  lately.  Several  productions  have  appeared</span><span>  from  time  to  time  in  our  local  journals,</span><span>  also  numerously  signed,  strange  to  say  with</span><span>  nearly  the  same  names,  in  the  same  rota</span><span>  tion.  But  I  have  been  informed  by  several</span><span>  whose  names  have  appeared  that  they  never  '</span><span>  authorised  that.  The  fact  is.  that  the  first</span><span>  signatures  they  got  were  put  to  all  the  other</span><span>  productions.  Those  parties  are  ver  v  angry,</span><span>  and  would  wish  to  deov  throngh  the  press,</span><span>  but  do  not  like  the  expense  of  doing  so.</span><span>  There  is.  certainly,  one  party  who  denied</span><span>  it  through  the  local  columns.</span><span>  I  must  say  that  since  the  weeding  the</span><span>  Council  got  lately,  everything  goes  quiet</span><span>  with  the  new  members,  they  seeming  all  to</span><span>  agree  and  go  throngh  their  duties  in  a  proper</span><span>  manner.  Very  different  from  the  way  the</span><span>  old  council  was  carried  on,  which  I,  with</span><span>  others,  are  very  glad  to  see,  and  hope  to  .see</span><span>  it  continue.  .  '  -</span><span>  The  big  man,  also,  says  that  our  Mayor</span><span>  would  not  get  fire  respectable  men  in  Drey</span><span>  ton  who  wonld  request  him  not  to  resign.</span><span>  Like  every  other  statement,  it  is  simply  nn</span><span>  trae,  ae  I,  with  several  others  of  the  inhabit-'</span><span>  ants,  waited  on  if  r.  Handcock  and  requested</span><span>  him  not  to  resign.  It  is  very  annoying  to'</span><span>  several  of  as  to  sea  our  town  brought  thus</span><span>  promiaentlr  before  the  public,  week  .after</span><span>  week,  and  all  owing  to  a  contemptible  clique</span><span>  who  have  no  iuterest  in  the  prosperity  of  the</span><span>  town.  People  at  a  distance.  I  expect,  -will</span><span>  fancy  us  aft  mad,  and.  dangerous  to  Hve  '</span><span>  amongst  :  we  are  so  fond  of  quarrelling.
