Of  the  original</span><span>  committee  appointed  to  administer  the</span><span>  fund,  only  two  members  —Mr  P.  J.</span><span>  Porter  and  himself—were  now  resi</span><span>  dent  Plttsworth.  This  confusion</span><span>  had  led  to  the  sub-branch  making  an</span><span>  offer  of  a  gift  of  a  building  allotment</span><span>  and  a  sum  of  £l5OO  to  the  Shire  Coun</span><span>  cil  to  assist.in  the  building  of  the  pro-’</span><span>  posed  civic  centre  atod  town  hall.  In-,</span><span>  actual  fact,  the  sub-branch  had  no  ’</span><span>  authority  to  make  this  offer,  as  It</span><span>  was  not  the  body  appointed  ip  ad</span><span>  minister  the  fund  and  must  accord</span><span>  ingly  withdraw  the  offer.  |</span><span>  The  report  also  detailed  events  which</span><span>  had  .  led  to  the  trustees  of  the</span><span>  Soldiers’  Memorial  School  of  Arts</span><span>  handing  over  to  the  League  the  pre-  1</span><span>  sent  building,  on  condition  that  the,</span><span>  library  and  reading  were  maintained</span><span>  as  public  facilities,  administered  by  the  1</span><span>  Shire  Council  for  the  benefit'  of  the.</span><span>  public.  The  C.W.A.  had  been  granted  j</span><span>  the  use  of  one  the  ren*“J»eor  ;</span><span>  :of  the  building  was  to  be  converted</span><span>  into  a  Diggers’  Club.  As  matters  now</span><span>  stood,  Mr.  Kingston  stated,  the  Dig-  1</span><span>  gers,  to  whom  the  building  had  been</span><span>  given,  found  that  they  had  no  room</span><span>  set  aside  for  their  own  exclusive  use,</span><span>  but  Shared  their  meeting  room  with  1</span><span>  the  baby  clinic  and  public  bodies  seek-  j</span><span>  ing  premises  to  which  to  hold  meet-'</span><span>  ings.  The  sub-branch  had  now  writ</span><span>  te|i  to  the  C.W.A.,  advising  that  the</span><span>  clinic’s  tenancy  in  the  soldiers’  room  *</span><span>  woujd  cease  from  31st  December.  1</span><span>  Mr.  Kingston  quoted  figures  from</span><span>  records  and  from  the  “Sentinel”  files</span><span>  which  showed  that  the  former  Schpolj</span><span>  of  Arts  had  never  been  conducted  pro-1</span><span>  fltably  over  the  years.,  Benefits  of:</span><span>  various  kinds  had  been  held  period!-1</span><span>  cally  to'stabilise  the  finances,  and|</span><span>  without  these  the  building  would  have</span><span>  operated  at  a  loss.  Since  the  transfer</span><span>  of  the  building  to  the  Diggers,  finan</span><span>  cial  conditions  had  been  somewhat</span><span>  similar.  The  Diggers  had  experienced</span><span>  great  difficulty  in  securing  a  caretaker</span><span>  for  the  building,  and  for  the  past  few</span><span>  weeks  the  billiards  room  had  been</span><span>  closed.  He  felt  that  some  new  set-up</span><span>  was  necessary,  and  he  put  before  the</span><span>  meeting  a  number  of  suggestions  for</span><span>  consideration.  He  had  always  been  of  j</span><span>  the  opinion  that  an  ex-servicemen’s</span><span>  club  would  not  be  a  profitable  ven-;</span><span>  ture  in  a  town  the  size  of  Plttsworth.  j</span><span>  The  building  was  erected  as  a  public,</span><span>  memorial  to  ex-servicemen,  and  it  was  |</span><span>  the  public’s  responsibility  to  maintain,</span><span>  it.  The  sub-branch  of  the  League  did</span><span>  not  operate  for  profit,  and  could  not  fin</span><span>  ance  the  activities  of  the  building.  He  }</span><span>  asked  the  Councillors  present  for  their</span><span>  opinion  on  the  matter.</span><span>  Councillor  Lee-Archer:  The  Council</span><span>  understands  the  Diggers'  difficulties</span><span>  is  willing  to  co-operate,</span><span>  1  After  further  discussion,  Mr.  N.  W.</span><span>  Daniel  moved:  “That  the  ex-service</span><span>  men  of  Plttsworth  and  district  aban</span><span>  don  the  project  to  establish  an  ex-ser</span><span>  vlcemen’s  club.”  The  motion  was</span><span>  seconded  by  Mr.  0.
