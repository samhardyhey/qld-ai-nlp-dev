The  decorations  wore  a  sight  worth  seeing,  and</span><span>  were  carried  out  in  hundreds  of  palms,  flags,  greenery,  and</span><span>  floral  bells.

"<p><span>  Sunlight  and  Shadow,</span></p> <p><span>  (For  '.'.Figaro."")</span></p> <p><span>  High  noon,  and  not  a  cloud'in  the  aky&lt;  Xot  a  breath</span><span>  of  wind1  to  agntate  the  ""dried-up  leaves  of  the  trees,  and</span><span>  ""woo  thorn  like  a  lover.""  Only  the  rays  of  the  turning  sun</span><span>  shining'  down  on  a  ravine;  one  precipitous  wall  pf  which</span><span>  rises  almost  perpendicularly,  while  the  other,  which  slopes</span><span>  more,  is  none  the  loss  ragged,  albeit  it  may  be  loss  steep.</span><span>  The  rays  of  the  sun  fall  upon  the  great  masses  of  rock,</span><span>  whore  shadows  lengthen  as  the  evening  progresses.  As  a</span><span>  matter  off  act,  -  thesimshi  ne  will  not  gleam  very  long,  on  th;|</span><span>  ravine.  Two  hours  more  and  the  mountain  will  conceal  the</span><span>  sun  from  the  view  of  any  person  in  the  gorge.  Daylight  wil^</span><span>  remain  for  a  long  time  after,  but  it  will  be  daylight-  in  the</span><span>  shadow  of  the  rocks.  But  now  it  Hs  sunlight.  It  is  shining</span><span>  and  baking  what  aUu  vial-deposit  there  is  in  the  bottom  of</span><span>  iha  ravine.  Walk  barefoot  over  the  surface  of  the  rocks,</span><span>  and  itg  small  stones,  and  you  will  have  some  idea  of  the</span><span>  powder  of  the  solar  rays.  It  is  all  dull  colour  around  you,</span><span>  a»t>  there  is  nothing  to  relieve  it.  Look  for  a  bit  of  emer</span><span>  ald  green  in  the  shape  of  a  blade  of  grass  and  you  will</span><span>  not  find  it..  If  you  went  around  the  bend  in  the  gully  you</span><span>  would  light  upon  a  small  tent  pitched  near  a  small  spring,</span><span>  from  which  the  water  conies  very  slow  but  clear.  The</span><span>  tent  is  on  the  side  of  the  sloping  ridge  above  the  gully,  but</span><span>  our  business  is  not  with  that  tent.  It  is  with  its  owner  ></span><span>  but  where  is  he  ?  At  the  spot  where  the  sun's  rays  shine</span><span>  most-there  is  an  angle  in  the  ravine.  Here  the  force  of  a</span><span>  former  flood  has  thrown  the  bvd  of  it  in  towards  a.  sharp</span><span>  wall  of  rock,  and  then  at  a  nearly  right  angle  it  comes</span><span>  round  the  base  of  it,  and  is  straight  for  over  iifty  yards,</span><span>  when  it  turns  once  more.  Here,  with  his  back  against  the</span><span>  fock,  his  hand  resting  o»  a  small  shovel,  with  his  pick</span><span>  thrown  against  a  heap  of  loese  earth,  which  he  has  just</span><span>  cast  up  from  a  hole  he.  is  sinking,  stands  a  man.  A  man</span><span>  with  a  stooped  figure,  a  bron  ed  countenance,  and  a  head</span><span>  of  hair  which  was  once  as  s  :>ft  and  silky  as  a  woman's,</span><span>  but  which  is  now.  thickly  matted,  and  plentifully  streaked</span><span>  with  lines  of  silver,  those  lines  which  often  mark  the  pro</span><span>  gress  of  years,  but  far  oftener  indicate  the  deep  sorrojv  of  a</span><span>  heart  broken  in  the  storm  of  life,  and  spirit  bent  beneath</span><span>  the  chill  wind  of  adversity.  He  has  deep  grey  eyes  which,</span><span>  in  man,  mark  the  presence  of  great  power,  and  deep  set  pur</span><span>  pose,  and,  in  woman  indicate-well,  the  most  famous  of</span><span>  women  have  had  grey  eyes-Mary  of  Scotland,.  Marie  An</span><span>  toinette  of  France,  for  instance.  lie  wore  an  old  moleskin</span><span>  trousers  that  was  nearly  threadbare  from  being  stretched  on</span><span>  a  log  every  Sunday  morninr,  and  rubbed  for  half  an</span><span>  hour  with  a  hard  scrubbing-brush,  in  order  to  take  1&lt;he  dirt</span><span>  of  the  week  out  of  it.  An  old  crimean  shint,  that  had  seen</span><span>  better  days,  covered  a  brawny  chest  and  broad  shoulders.</span><span>  The  blazing  rays  of  the  North  Queensland  sun  shone  down</span><span>  011  a  battered  hat  that  covered  his  head-or,  we  should</span><span>  rather  say,  shaded  it,  for  that  cranium  hardened  -by  ex</span><span>  posure  to  years  of  hot  suns,  and  fierce  storms,  was  not</span><span>  very  liable  to,  sunstroke.  He  held  an  old  piece  of  paper  in</span><span>  his  hand,  a.  piece  torn  off  the  corner  of  some  journal.  He</span><span>  Received  it  wrapped  around  a  pound  of  tobacco  the  last</span><span>  time  ho  was  in  Thorn-borough,  and,  after  he^brought  it  to</span><span>  his  camp,  he  noticed  that  H  contained  some  verses.  It  was4</span><span>  a  copy  of  a  song  which  bad  a  great-  succcss  when  it  first</span><span>  came  out-it  was  Pinsuti\s  famous  ''Lauklie.''

There</span><span>  was  something-  in  them  ihat  had  a  charm  for  him,  and  he</span></p> <p><span>  read  them  over  andwover  again.  He  was  now  reading  them;</span><span>  or,  rather,  humming  them  for  the  hundredth  time.  He  had</span><span>  ^set  them  to  some  air  of  his'^wn,""  ¥afid'.tti$  jjfeirt  he  lingered</span></p> <p><span>  on  most  was-  .?

Far  awa'  he  was</span><span>  now  from  the  great  peaks-far  awa'  from  Arthur's  Seat.</span><span>  But  he  was  once  more  sleeping  near  the  shores  of  Loch</span><span>  Katrine,  or  walking  in  the  High-street  of  classic  Edinburgh3^</span><span>  He  wag  sitting  by  the  fire  of  a  winter's  evening,  with  the</span><span>  pure  snow  falling  hi  white  soft  flakes  outside^  He  was</span><span>  listening  to  the  ovt-told  stories,  old  traditions  ;  he  heard</span><span>  once  more  recounted  the  multifarious  escapes  of  ""bonnie</span><span>  Prince  Charlie,""  and  of  the  dauntless  heroism  of  Flora</span><span>  Macdonald  ;  of  the  crimes  committed  by  Cumberland's  blood</span><span>  hounds-the  savage,  cruel,  Cumberland,  the  friend  and  pat</span><span>  ron  of  the  corrupt  Henry  Fox,  firat  Lord  Holland  ;  and  the</span><span>  romantic  ad\$:ntures  of  the  survivors  of  Gulloden.

He  was  but  a  boy</span><span>  then,  but  the  boy  is  often  more  ambitious  than  the  man,</span></p> <p><span>  .and.  is  apt  to  erect  fictional  ^castles  in  the  air""  which  the</span><span>  cahnon  of  hard  reality  soon  demolishes.

When  he</span><span>  heard  them,  he.was  but  a  youth,  and  he  had  not  met  that</span><span>  fair-haired  Scotch  lassie,  who  won  h's  heart  in  after  years,</span><span>  but  who,  woman  like,  gave  her  own  to  the  gay,  dashing</span><span>  English  tourist,with  the  blue  eyes,  soft  white  hand,  and</span><span>  winning  speech,  who  soon  forgot  Eisne  when  he  was  flirting</span><span>  with  thej  id.feughters  of  May  fair,  or  only  remembered  her  as</span><span>  ""aw  d'ooc^Gpretty  gurl""  whom  he  had  met  in  the  grouse</span><span>  season  in  Scotland,  and  wiled  away  many  a  pleasant  hour</span><span>  &lt;(too  pleasant  for.  her)  by  moorland  and  stream.  The  d'gge-*</span><span>  thought  of  her  onCe  more,  and  the  recollection,  li  e  old</span><span>  remembrances  of  former  loves,  was  both  sweet  and  bitter.</span><span>  He  was  once  more  her  faithful  lovrer,  and  once  mo^e  the</span><span>  scene  came  back  of  the  evening,  when,  with  excitad  looks</span><span>  and  a  voice  of  passion,  he  denounced  her  as  a  faithless</span><span>  daughter  of  Eve.  He  remembered  the  wild  sor/ow  with</span><span>  which  she  entreated  him  to  forgive  her,  and  the  rough  man  -</span><span>  ner  in  which  he  had  flung  her  from  him  and  hastened  away.</span><span>  He  never  looked  on  her  girlish  beauty  again,  anld  her  after</span><span>  fate  was  a  mystery-to  him.  That  was  over  thirty  years</span><span>  ago,  and  what  a  life  he  had  &lt;led  since  then.  He  had  been</span><span>  side  by  side  with  ""Timmy  ""Lalor""  in  the  Ballarat  sLockade.</span><span>  -  lie  struck  it  '''rich""  at  dusty  Bendigo,  and  two  months  of</span></p> <p><span>  mad,  reckless  dissipation  in'Melbourne,  had  left  him  penni</span><span>  less  once  more.  What  a  gay  life  it  was  during  thos  i  two</span><span>  months'.  Fiz|  flowing  likie  the  sparkling  stream  from  the  cas</span><span>  cade,  all  day  long;  gold  flung  recklessly  about,  and.every</span><span>  day,  haiMeldow-well-met.  It  did  not  last,  those  scenes</span><span>  never  'do,  and  eight  weeks  of  champagne  qualified  him  for</span><span>  twelve  months  of  muddy  water-out  of  a  pannikin.  He  was</span><span>  working  hard  again.  He  prospected  all  the  ranges  and</span><span>  gullies  in  Victoria,  where  there  was  the  slightest  probability</span><span>  of  getting  gold.  He  saw  men  strike  rich  reefs,  grow  rich,</span><span>  and  even  condescend  to  enter  Parliament,  to  play  the  fool's</span><span>  part  on  the  political  stage  ;  but  he  did  not  get  rich.  He</span><span>  was  one  of  the  first  on  the  T>achlan  rush,  and  he  made</span><span>  /tucker""  and  little  else.  He  'remembered  well  that  night</span><span>  when  Frank  Gardiner  camped  with  him,  and  he  did  not</span><span>  know  who  his  guest  had  been  until  he  saw  him  some  time</span><span>  afterwards  on  trial  for  his  life.  The  years  went  by,  tha</span><span>  Palmer  broke  out,  and  the  steamers  leaving  Sydney  for</span><span>  Cooktown  were  crowded.  It  was  the  biggest  rlush  since  the</span><span>  days  when  thousands  of  idiots  parted  with  what,  little</span><span>  brains  they  possessed,  and  tried  to  find  payable  gold  at</span><span>  Canoona.  But  there  was  payable  gold  on  the  Palmer,  and</span><span>  plenty  of  it.  He  was  one  of  the  passengers  to  Cooktown.</span><span>  He  ""humped  his  drum""  through  ""Hell's  gate,""  along  that</span><span>  rough  dangerous  track  that  led  to  the  field.  He  saw  men</span><span>  make  their  pile  and  die  from  fever,  and  men  make  it,  and</span><span>  go  south  to  enjoy  it.  He  worked  as  hard  as  either  of  them</span><span>  but  he  did  not  get  rich.  He  drew  no  valuable  prizes  in  the</span><span>  gold  lottery.  He  made  enough  for  ""tucker.""  and  that  was</span><span>  all.  He  had  the  fever,  not  oily  the  gold  fever,  but  the</span><span>  malaria  of  the  north,  and  he  survived  it.  Years  passed  and</span><span>  he  lingered  round  the  district,  as  a  lover  lingers  round  a</span><span>  spot  where  he  if?  to  meet  his  charmer.  His  syren  .was</span><span>  bright  yellow  gold,  but  .he  only  saw  b£t  in  the  avaricious</span><span>  embrace  of  {others.  *  He  made  splendid  resolutions,  that</span><span>  :if  he  /'struck  it  rich""  again  he  would  do  such  a  lot  of  good</span><span>  things.  But  we  all  do  that,  alas  !  we  never  get  thn  oppor</span><span>  tunity  of  carrying  out  those  good  resolutions.  He  did  not</span><span>  attain  the  opportunity  either.  The  Hodgkinson  brought  an</span><span>  other  rush  and  he  went  with  ihe  stream.^  Again  ho  worked</span><span>  hard  but  was  not  successful.  FiVerybody  S3emed  to  g^et  gold</span><span>  Ibut  'did  -:,no.t  deter  him  from  persevering.  He</span><span>  was  in.  the  shadow  of  fortune,  but  he  thought  the  sunlight</span><span>  must  come  sometime.  Men  left  the  Hodgkinson,  but  he  did</span><span>  T^ot  leave  i£,  and  even  affce?  ti#  mines  broke  out  fte  still</span></p> <p><span>  clung  to  the  old  attraction,  gold.  He  had  been  attacked  by</span><span>  the  blacks  several  4$naes,  but  if  he  was  not  fortunate  in  thp,</span><span>  search  of  gold,  toe  was  lucky  in  avoiding1  the  spears  of  the</span><span>  aboriginals.  '  He  was  a  splendid  shot,  and  that  is  a  very</span><span>  convincing  argument  in  dealing  with  a  north  Queensland</span><span>  aboriginal.  Would  he  fee  so  lucky  always  ?  Perhaps-and</span><span>  perhaps.  Therms  is  world  of  meaning  in  that  word*''perhaps,''</span><span>  though  you  mayi  not  think  so.  Though  the  sunlight  may</span><span>  be  shining  upon  us,  the  shadows  of  fate  steadily  pursue  us.</span><span>  His  eyes  were  on  the  ground,  and  he  still  continued  mus</span><span>  ing.  B|3  was  too  intent  upon  the  ""memories  of  the  past""</span><span>  to  take  heed  of  what  was  going  on  all  round,  and  above.</span><span>  He  did  not  notiee  the  dusky  forms  upon  the  heights,  and</span><span>  He  did  not  see  the  demoniacal  expressions  which  thrnr  hid</span><span>  eous  countenances  wore,  as  they  thought  that  at  last  they</span><span>  had  a  change  of  being  revenged  on  the  man,  who  for  years</span><span>  had  defied  them.  He  heard  not  their  stealthy  tread  as  they</span><span>  stole  nearer  nearer,  nearer  ;  he  marked  not  the  poisoned</span><span>  spears  in  their  hands  as  alternately  walking  upright,</span><span>  crowding  down,  and  creeping  along  the  ground,  they  came</span><span>  onward  still  nearer-he  saw  not  the  poising  of  the  spears</span><span>  balanced  for  a  moment  in  the  hands  of  savages-he  heard</span></p> <p><span>  not  the  whizzing  of  the  instruments  of  his  fate  through  the</span></p> <p><span>  air  ;  but</span></p> <p><span>  -  *  *  *  *</span></p> <p><span>  There  was  one  jagged  spear  through  his  breast,  which</span><span>  he  had  broken  off  at  the  point  where  it  entered  the  flesh  I</span><span>  there  was  another  between  his  shoulders,  which  he  hadjiot</span><span>  bro  ien  off,  ajad  there  were  two  through  his  left  thigh.</span><span>  Suffering  the  most  excruciating  agony,  he  raised  himself  to</span><span>  a  sitting  posture  for  a  moment,  and  fired  his  revolver.  The</span><span>  shot  did  not  t?ll,  and  he  fell  back  exhausted,  and  a  sharp</span><span>  spasm  of  pain  contracted'  his  features  as  the  concussion  with</span><span>  the  hard  ground  caused  the  blood  to  spurt  out  from  his</span><span>  wounds!.  The  blacks  did  not  fl:""ng  any  mo  re  ..spears,  but</span><span>  scampered  behind  the  rlocks,  out  of  range  of  the  revolver.</span><span>  The  liie-b'lood  was  gushing  forth,  and  he  knew  *£hat""  his</span><span>  hour  had'  come.  He  did  not  see  the  sunshine.  He  felt  a</span><span>  film  gathering  over  his  eyes,  and  he  heard  not  thie  sa  age</span><span>  yells  of  his  slayers.  His'  right  grasped  the  revolver,  which</span><span>  he  held  pointed';  his  left  clenched  the  paper  containing  the</span><span>  words  of  tho  song.  His  mind  went  back  to  the  recollec</span><span>  tions  from  which  it  had  been  so  rudely  disturbed.  They</span><span>  crowded  fast  and  furious,  but  clear  and  vivid  on  his  mind.</span><span>  He  thought  of  his  father  and  mother  lying  in  a  distant</span><span>  grave,  and  of  the  days  when  he  had  been  their  pridfc,  and</span><span>  they  used  to  call  him  ""Our  Laddie.""  And  she  used  to^call</span><span>  him  ""My  Laddie""  before  that  fair-haired  Englishman  came.</span><span>  The  sunlight  faded  and  the  shadows  deepened.  The  blood</span><span>  trickled  forth,  but  he  felt  no  pain.  He.  uplifted  ,his  eyes</span><span>  once,  and  gazed  at  the  blue  s\y  f0r  the  last  time  ;  there</span><span>  was  a  slight  quivering  of  the  body,  there  was  a  gurgle  in</span><span>  the  throat,  a  hoarse  whispering  of  ""Elsie-Elsie-El-V-a</span><span>  smile  on  the  features,  the  pulse  stopped,  the  heart  ceased  to</span><span>  foeat,  and  ""Laddie""  was  dead.  Dead  with  his  body  trans</span><span>  fixed  with  spears,  and  his  face  upturned  to  the  sky.  Dead</span><span>  at  last,  after  so  many  vicissitudes.  Dead  with  the  blacks</span><span>  howling  around  him-tying  calm  and  still,  with  a  smile  on</span><span>  his  face.  And  thus  the  animating  bright  rays  of  the  sun</span><span>  light  of  life  vanished  and  the  dark  gloomy  shadows  o*  the</span></p> <p><span>  valley  of  death  took  their  place.</span></p> <p><span>  *  *  *  *</span></p> <p><span>  Ten  Months  after.

But  destiny,  in  the</span><span>  oiiape  of  parents  of  stern  and  old-fashioned  mold,  the  kind</span><span>  that  thought  and  accepted  it  as  a  convenient  creed  that,</span><span>  having  inflicted  life  upon  their  offspring,  they  were  entirely</span><span>  i.t  liberty  to  ruin  that  life-this  destiny  ordained  that  he</span><span>  should  have  a  profession  other  than  that  of  arms  ;  in  short,</span><span>  that  he  should  be  a  lawyer.</span></p> <p><span>  Now  Saunders  was  of  an  age  to  judge  for  himself,  and</span><span>  he  knew  that  he  was  not  of  the  stuff  of  which  lawyers  are</span><span>  ma/de.  Not  the  slightest  vestige  of  eloquence  had  he  ;  he</span><span>  was  blunt  and  truthful  to  a  degree.  He  disliked1  a  lie  for</span><span>  its  own  sake.  All  this  and  more  he  told  his  parents,  but</span><span>  he  was  answered  by  the  logic  which  has  retarded  the</span><span>  world's  progress  through  so  many  generations,  that  they</span><span>  were  older  and  therefore  wiser,  that  he  was  their  son  and</span><span>  they  knew  better  what  was  good  for  him  that  he  could  pos</span><span>  sibly.  Saunders,  imore  from  a  sense  of  duty  than  a  fear  of</span><span>  '.ting  disinherited  of  his  father's  goodly  estates,  accepted</span><span>  their  decision  and  began  the  reading  of  law.</span></p> <p><span>  About  this  time  he  chose  for  chum  a  yousth  whose  only</span><span>  possible  recommendation  must  have  been  that  he  could  boast</span><span>  of  army  relatives.  He  had  visited  in  his  sallow-gosling</span><span>  days  at  a  garrison,  and  was  fulj  of  highly  spiced  tales  re</span><span>  garding  the  wild  daring  and  fascination  of  a  soldier's  life.</span><span>  Saunders  would  drink  in  all  these  stories,  and  despite  his</span><span>  valiant  efforts  to  forget  them  and  put  temptation  away  they</span><span>  would  come  back  to  him  as  he  sat  poring  oTer  the  inexpres</span><span>  sibly  stupid  folios  relating  to  the  law.</span></p> <p><span>  One  summer  this  chum  of  his  invited'  Saunders  to  visit</span><span>  him  at  his  country-house  on  the  Hudson.  Saundersi  went</span><span>  arid  spent  the  happiest  two  weeks  of  his  life.  For  it  was</span><span>  there  that  he  met  Madge  Kean,  the  bewitching  little  daugh</span><span>  ter  of  Col'onel  Kean,  of  the  Tenth.  Saunders  caught  his</span><span>  frst  glimpse  of  her  as  he  walked  with  young  Milton  up  the</span><span>  driveway.  Madge  was  armed  with  a  Flobert  rifle,  and  was</span><span>  teaching  the  little  son  of  the  house  how  to  aim  and  pull  the</span><span>  trigger.  There  was  something  in  her  very  pose,  in  the  fact</span><span>  of  her  knowing  how  to  shoot,  that  appealed  to  Saunders  at</span><span>  once.  He  could  tnot  see  her  face,  but,  nevertheless,  he  said</span><span>  to  M  lton  that  she  was  a  '-'mighty  pretty  girl.""  Milton</span><span>  replied  with  pardonable  pride  that  the  young  lady:was  his</span><span>  cousin,  had  just  come  from  the  Far  West,  was  of  the  army,</span></p> <p><span>  and  a  ""(darned  pretty  little  flirt.""m  Therefore,  before  Saun-.</span><span>  ders  'had  even  been  introduced  to  the  fair  Madge,  he  was</span><span>  perilously  near  to  being  in  love.</span></p> <p><span>  When  he  stood  beside  her,  and  Milton  was  saying  ""This</span><span>  Is  my  chum  Saunder,  Madge  ;  MTSs  Kean,  Saunders,""  when</span><span>  her  bright  eyes  glanced  at  him  from  under  her  long  lashes</span><span>  iust  like  an  untamed'mustang's,  a,s  Saunders  mentally  com</span><span>  mented-when  she  smiled  and  put  out  a  hatld  all  smutty</span><span>  from  powder,  Saunders  thought  her  the  most  bewitching</span><span>  woman  lie  had  ever,  seen.  And  Madge,  in  her  turn,  made</span><span>  ""ote  of  the  fact  that  Satinders  was  tall,  blonde,  and  ex</span><span>  tremely  harfdsoitje,  with  that  unmistakable  air  of  self-pos</span><span>  session  and  refinement  of  a  New  York  gentleman.  She  de</span><span>  termined  that  he  would  be  much  better  material  to  expend</span><span>  her  fascinations  on  than  that  milksop  of  a  cousin  of  hers.</span></p> <p><span>  was  glad  he  had  come,  and  said  so.  Saunders  answer</span><span>  ed,  in  a  tone  which  carried  conviction  that  he  also  was  glad</span><span>  he  had  come,  and1  Madge  blushed  trough  one  of  those  clear</span></p> <p><span>  tanned  skins  which  change  colour  with  every  emotion.  Not</span><span>  that  she  was  shy  and  schoolgirl  ish  in  her  blushes  ;  they  were</span></p> <p><span>  not  a  result  of  timidity.</span></p> <p><span>  Cupid  did  not  hit  Saunders's  heart  with  the  traditional</span><span>  golden  arrow  thife  time.  It  was  thve  tiny  bullets  of  l&ad</span><span>  which  went  from  the  mu&zle  of  the  Flobert  straight  to  the</span><span>  bull's-eye  of  the  targaft  that  made  fhe  wounds  which  are  in</span><span>  fficted  sooner  or  later  on'every  man.  By  the  time  the  wee</span><span>  cartridge-box  was  empty,  Saunders?  was  hopelessly  smitten.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  course  of  the  next  fortnight  the  came  to  that  point*</span></p> <p><span>  where  he  would  even  had  studied  law  with  pleasure  had  she  ...</span><span>  expressed  an  admiration  for  law  students.  But  she  did  not.</span><span>  He  had  confided  to  her  all  his  baffled  ambitions  ;  had  told</span><span>  her  how  his  soul  yeaned  for  shoulder-straps  ;  and  she,  in</span><span>  turn,  told  him  that  the  life  of  a  soldier  was  the  only  one</span><span>  worth  living.  He  was  too  old  for  West  Point  ;  why  didn't</span><span>  he  try  for  a  civil  appointment  ?  This  had  never  occurred</span><span>  to  him  ;  he  would  think  it  *  over.  He  asked  her  some  ques</span><span>  t  ons  and  confided  some  of  his  ideas  of  garrison  life  to  her.</span><span>  She  laughed  at  them,  and  told  him  that  he  was  a  ""dear  old</span><span>  tenderfoot.""  If  it  had  not  been  for  the  tone  of  voice  in</span><span>  which  she  said  it,  for  the  roguish,  half-fond  glance  from  her</span><span>  mustang  eyes,  Saunders  woilld  have  been  terribly  cut  up</span></p> <p><span>  over  that  scornful  word.</span></p> <p><span>  ""'Tenderfoot-tenderfoot,""  he  !  after  all  he  had  read  on</span><span>  the  subject.  Could  it  be  that  his  source  of  information  was</span><span>  bad  ?  He  did  not  ask  Mftdge  this,  however  ;  he  never  put</span><span>  forth  any  of  his  ideas  on  the  subject  again  to  her  ;  asked</span><span>  for  no  further  information  ;  fie  knew  he  was  missing  golden</span><span>  opportunities  for  enlightenment,  but  he  did  not  care  to  be</span><span>  laughed  at.  He  was  aware  'that  nothing  would  so  much  in</span><span>  jure  him  in  her  eyes  as  to  make  Himself  ridiculous.  And</span><span>  Madge  in  that  fortnight  exerted,  first,  every  charm  she  pos</span><span>  sessed,  every  power  she  could  command,  to  bring  him  to</span><span>  her  feet.  .  ;</span></p> <p><span>  Having  succeeded  in  this,  sh^used  quite  as  much  skill  in</span><span>  keeping  Mm  from  asking  her  to.  marry-  him.  She  didn't</span><span>  want  to  be  married,  she  didn't  event  wint  to  be  engaged,</span></p> <p><span>  he  was  only  the  pasjtime  of  a  summer's  jaunt.  Nobody</span><span>  took  such  flirtations  seriously  ;  that  is,  nobody  with  any</span><span>  sense.  If  he  couldn't  see  that  she  was  in  fun,  it  wasn'it  her</span><span>  fault,  was  it  ?  She  wasn't  accountable  for  his  being  defi:</span><span>  cient  in  powers  of  perception,  was  she?  A  New  York  man</span><span>  ought  to  know  how  to  take  care  of  himself.</span></p> <p><span>  Well,  the  Little  summer  play  was  over.  Saunders  went</span></p> <p><span>  back  to  town  with  the  secret  determination  to  cut  loose</span></p> <p><span>  from  the  grind  of  the  law-reading  to  go  into  the  army.  He</span><span>  had  not  told  Madge  of  this  ;  somehow,  looking  back  on  it,</span><span>  he  hadn't  told  her  anything  that  he  had  meant  to  ;  he  had</span><span>  been  half  afTaid  that  she  would  laugh.  It  would  never  do</span><span>  to  have  her  laugh.</span></p> <p><span>  Of  course  there  was  a  big  row  at  his  home  when  he  an</span><span>  nounced  his  determination.  But  the  breath  of  free  air  that</span><span>  he  had  drawn  'in  from  contact  with  Madge  made  him  see</span><span>  that  he  should  have  something  to  say  in  the  matter  of  his</span><span>  own  career.  Moreover,  he  had  the  strength  of  love  to  up</span><span>  hold  him.  He  surprised  his  parents  by  asserting  his  free</span><span>  dom  of  action;  and  when-they  made  it  ""too  disagreeable  for</span><span>  his  self-respect  to  allow  him  to  stay  under  their  roof,  he</span><span>  left  it,  with  paternal  aifd  maternal  maledictions  following</span><span>  him.  He  started  in  to  obtain  a  civil  appointment,  and</span><span>  learned  more,  before  he  realised  his  failure,  of  the  nature</span><span>  of  human  beings  and  of  the  struggle  for  existence  than  he</span><span>  had  e\  er  known  before.  It  came  about  that  he  obtained  no</span><span>  civil  appointment,  and  he  knew  that  liis  father  had  done</span><span>  Ms  be^t,  covertly,  thaE  he  should  not  obtain  it.  This  one</span><span>  thing  he  could  not  forgive.  Meantime  he  longed  for  Madge</span><span>  with  the  \vh'  1?  rower  of  his  heart.  He  wrote  to  her  and</span><span>  received  ro  re;  1  .  So  he  supposed  that  she  had  not  got</span><span>  his  letter.  The  thought  that  she  had  ignored  it  did  not</span><span>  come  to  1  im.  The  final  refusal  of  a  commission  was  a  blow</span><span>  from  which  he  did  not  recover  for  some  days-he  lost  heart</span><span>  for  a  time  :  but  he  read  in  an  ""Army  and  *Navy""  that  Miss</span><span>  Kean  had  been  desperately  ill.  That  afternoon  he\enlisted</span><span>  as  a  pr  vate  soldier,  and  the  next  morning  wore  the  blue.</span></p> <p><span>  This  was  not  being  a  colonel  or  a  general,  but  men  had</span><span>  risen  from  the  ranks  to  sudden  fame  and  honour  in  the  books</span><span>  he  had  read  ;  besides,  he  was  at  his  last  penny,  A  little</span></p> <p><span>  wave  of  disgust  ran  over  him  as  he  learned  that  thirteen</span><span>  dollars  a  month,  with  clothing,  bed,  and  board,  would  be</span><span>  his  share  of  this  world's  goods..  He  enlisted'  with  that</span><span>  vague  notion,  which  the""  average  citizen  of  that  day  had,</span><span>  that  officers  and  men  inhabited  peacefully  the  same  quar</span><span>  ters  ;  that  the  barrack-room  was  a  sort  of  happy  family</span><span>  cage,  where  shoulder-straps  and  chevrons  went  side  by  side.</span><span>  He  had  not  stopped  to  think  that  the  West  was  wide,  and</span><span>  that  he  might  he  assigned  to  a  post  .several  thousand  miles</span><span>  from  the  one  which  his  lady-love  lighted  with  her  presence.</span><span>  It  was  not  until  the  deed  w'Hs  done  that  this  came  to  him,</span><span>  and  then  he  could  only  hope  and  pray.</span></p> <p><span>  As  luck  would  have  it,  he  was  sent  to  the  very  post</span><span>  where  Colonel  Kean  was  stationed.  This  did  nolt  exactly</span><span>  surprise  him  ;  he  took  it  as  .  a  matter  of  course  that  Provi</span><span>  dence  should  interfere  in  behalf  of  a  Saunders-of  one  of  the</span><span>  handsomest  and  mosft  popular  fellows  in  his  set.  He  won</span><span>  dered  what  his  friends  at  home  thought  of  his  escapade.</span><span>  Then  he  settled  down  to  the  discomforts  of  second-class  ac</span><span>  commodations  in  a  railway  car.  Fortunately  for  him,  the</span><span>  garrison  to  which  he  was  ordered  happened  to  be  very  near</span><span>  to  the  railroad,  and  was  spared  a  cross-country  trip  of  a</span></p> <p><span>  hundred  or  two  miles.</span></p> <p><span>  Words  can  not  paint  the  miseries  that  Saunders  went</span><span>  ehrough.  They  were  not  physical  miseries,  for  he  was  well</span><span>  fed,  well-sheltered,  well-clothed,  not  overworked,  and  was</span><span>  spared  the  humiliation  and  pain  of  the  raw  recruit  who</span><span>  learns  for  the  first  time  to  bestride  a  barebacked  horse.</span><span>  Saunders  was  an  old  hand  at  steeple-chase,  and  had  little</span><span>  to  learn,  save  a  few  technicalities.  But  he  found  that  the</span><span>  line  which  divided  officers  and  men  was  as  the  line  which</span><span>  divided  Lazarus  in  heaven  from  the  rich  man  in  hell  ;  that</span><span>  beyond  a  salute  and  a  conversation  thickly  sprinkled</span><span>  with  ""sirs""  and  ""very  good,  sirs""  on  the  part  of</span><span>  the  private,  and  with  crisp  orders  and  sometimes  oaths</span><span>  from  the  officer,  there  was  no  speech.  He  did  not  even  see</span><span>  Madge  for  three  days,  but  was  induced  to  overcome  his  pre</span><span>  determination  to  call  upon  her.  He  saw  within  an  hour</span><span>  after  he  had  stepped  upon  the  reservation  that  he  would</span><span>  hardly  be  welcome.  It  was  bad  enough  not  to  be  able  to</span><span>  see  his  divin  ty  ;  it  was  infinitely  worse  when,  at  last,  he</span><span>  met  her.  She  gave  a  great  gasp  and  start,  blushed,  and</span><span>  returned  his  bow  with  just  the  slightest  nod  and  condes</span><span>  cending  .smile.  He  saw,  with  dismay,  that  he  was  to  her</span><span>  simply  a  menial-that  he  could  not  dare  to  overstep  the  li:</span></p> <p><span>  which  divided  them.</span></p> <p><span>  He  got  over  his  desire  to  shoot  himself  every  time  he</span><span>  was  vgiven  an  order  in  her  hearing,  after  a  while.  He  watch</span><span>  ed  her  flirtations  with  a  gorgeous  first  lieutenant  in  bitter</span><span>  ness  of  spirit,  and  the  thought  dawned  upon  him  that  sliji</span><span>  was  not  true  ;  but  he  hoped  she  would  leave  the  first  lieu</span><span>  tenant  when  he  (Saunders)  should  have  won  his  spurs.  But</span><span>  even  the  spurs  seemed  far  away  ;  he  had  come  to  understand</span><span>  that  the  jump  'from  the  uniform  of  an  enlisted  man  into</span><span>  that  of  an  officer  is  a  difficult  feat,  or  was  in  those  days,</span><span>  and  no  chance  for  physical  prowess  presented  itself.  Mor</span><span>  al^  he  was  as  brave  as  only  a  man  in  love  can  be.  He</span><span>  would  have  killed  himself  had  he  jptot  been.  More  courage</span><span>  than  to  carry  a  standard  to  the  cajinon's  mouth  did  it  take</span><span>  for  him  to  obey  the  fijrst  order  to  ""police,"".with  a  fatigue</span><span>  party,  the  back-yards  of  the  officers'  quarters.  To  '""oolice""</span><span>  is  army  for  cleaning  up,  and  it  is  left,  as  a  ""  1  thing,</span><span>  to  the  prisoners  who  happen  to  be  in  the  guard-house.  But</span><span>  at  this  time  there  were  very  few  prisoners,  not  more  than</span><span>  one  or  two,  for  tho  men  had  been  upon  their  good  behav</span><span>  iour,  it  being  almosjt  two  monthsmince  the  paymaster's  la3t</span><span>  visit,  and  no  cash  left  to  be  expMaed  upon  whisky  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  sutler's.  So  Saunders  sallied  forth  in  fatigue  suit-overalls</span><span>  and  coat  of  canvas-and  he  helped  the  others  to  sweep  with</span><span>  stable-brooms  and  to  shovel  up  in  the  back-yards.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  colonel's  yard  he  was  mercifully  spared  meeting</span><span>  ""Madge-it  would  have  been,  he  felt,  the  last  straw-arid  he</span></p> <p><span>  did  not  know  that  from  behind  her  filmy  curtain  she  was</span><span>  watching  him  with  amusement  and  pity,  the  while  she  turn</span><span>  ed  about  on  the  tf  ird  finger  of  her  left  hand  a  large  soli</span><span>  taire  ring  and  wondered  what  he  would  say  when  he  should</span><span>  hear  of  her  approaching  marriage  to  the  dashing  lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span>  Then  the  police  party  went  on  its  way,  and  came  at  last'</span><span>  to  the  yard  of  that  very  lieutenant.  There  was  a  half-sheet</span><span>  of  notepaper  in  one  of  the  piles  of  dust  and  rubbish  which</span><span>  had  been  swept  up.  Saunders  noticed  it-noticed,  though</span><span>  it  was  crumpled,  that  the  writing  upon  it  was  Madge's</span><span>  pointed  scrawl.  He  picked  it  up  and  slipped  it  into  his</span><span>  pocket.  It  was  not  an  honest  thing  to  do,  but  lie  did  not</span><span>  stop  to  think-he  only  wondered  what  a  note  of  hers  was</span><span>  doing  in  this  man's  back-yard  and  what  was  in  it.</span></p> <p><span>  When  he  got  back  to  the  barracks  he  read  the  note.</span><span>  There  was  enough  therein  to  make  him  understand  that</span><span>  Madge-his  Madge-for  whom  he  had  given  up  everything,</span><span>  for  whom  he  had  endured  so  much  humiliation,  was  to  be</span><span>  married  in  one  week  to  that  first  lieutenant  ;  that  she  was</span><span>  in  love-'desperately  in  love-with  him,  and  did  not  hesitate</span><span>  to  say  so.  Was  the  man  in,love  with  her  ?  If  he  was,  why</span><span>  did  he  crumple  up  and  virow  away  a  note  for  which  Saun</span><span>  ders  would  have  given  his  very  soul  ?</span></p> <p><span>  Then  Saunder,s  looked  about  him  with  eyes  opened  by</span><span>  despair.  He  saw  at  last  the  barrier  of  caste  in  all  its</span><span>  height  and  strength  ;  lie  saw  what  he  had  done,  and  he</span><span>  shuddered.  There  were  but  two  ways  out  of  this,  unless  he</span><span>  waited  until  his  enrstrrent  was  up-four  and  a  half  more</span><span>  years  ;  and  that  Ire  co;  Id  not  do.  He  could  kill  himself,</span><span>  but  he  was  young  remember,  it  was  not  lightly  to  be  done  ;</span><span>  and-he  could  desert.  To  his  mind  a  deserter  was  not  what</span></p> <p><span>  it  is  to  a  man  who  has  been  long  in  the  service-ail  the  dis</span><span>  grace  of  it  did  not  occur  to  him.  If  itj  had  been  explained</span><span>  to  him,  he  could  not  have  grasped  the  full  horror  of  it.  So""</span><span>  he  waited  his  chance  for  four  days  and  then  ""bolted,""  as</span><span>  his  comrades  termed  it.

Labour  politics  do  not  commend  themselves  to  the</span><span>  public  in  times  of  prosperity.  They  score  when  times  are</span><span>  rotten  and  the  Government  of  the  day  is  held  responsible</span><span>  for  the  drought,  the  ticks,  the  prickly  pear,  the  declining</span><span>  birth  rate,  the  prevalent  influenza,  and  so  on.

However,</span><span>  they  take  credit  for  the  one  and  get  the  blame  for  the</span><span>  other.

They  drag  the</span><span>  depths  of  imagination  for  reasons  for  a  position  tibat  is</span><span>  quite  ajainst  them,  ignoring  the  reaj  reasons.  In.all  Lab</span><span>  our  conventions  extremists  find  a  free  uninterrupted  talking</span><span>  place,  where  they  can  without  fear  of  opposition  pour  out</span><span>  their  ideas,  which  have  not  to  run  through  the  machine  of</span><span>  criticism,  and  upon  which  the  light  of  independent  honest</span><span>  thought  is  not  shed  ;  and  they  pat  themselves  on  the</span><span>  back  and  think  that  unadulterated  wisdom,is  their  unhappy</span><span>  lot.

This  has  always  struck  me  as  a  foolish</span><span>  thing  to  indulge  in.  For  instance,  there  are  many  men  who</span><span>  listen  round  the  lorry  and  read  the  pages  of  the  Labour</span><span>  journals,  who  are  eager  for  knowledge  and  who  have  an</span><span>  oren  urind  and  have  an  intelligence  that  must  be  treated</span><span>  with  something  more  convincing  than  abuse  and  platitude.</span><span>  They  probably  don't  agree  with  all  that  the  Labour  leaders</span><span>  believe  in,  and  they  find  themselves  abused  scurrilously,  be</span><span>  cause  they  'dare  to  hold  an  opinion  contrary  to  some  .plank</span><span>  in  the  platform.  This  kind  of  man  can't  stand  this  from</span><span>  men  of  whom  he  has  taken  their  measure,  and  who  finds</span><span>  the  preacher  of  Labour  politics  inferior  intellectually,  in</span><span>  ferior  in  information,  inferior  in  those  qualities  that  -make</span><span>  for  greatne.  s.

They  a^oid  appealing  to  the  intellects.</span><span>  Naturally,  tih&  tmdependent  thoughtful  scratches  out  the</span><span>  Labour  candidate's  name  on  the  ballot  paper.  These  r&lt;*</span><span>  flectipns  are  induced  by  an  enforced  or  a  not  altogether</span><span>  voluntary  dose  of  Labour  platform  tactics  and  Laibour  jour</span><span>  nal  scrrechings  during  the  recent  by-elections.</span><span>  The  Result</span></p> <p><span>  showeci  that  extremists  in  politics,  especially  in  Labour</span><span>  g^i^list  politics,  are  not  in  such  universal  favour  as  they</span><span>  would  like,  and  in  fact  in  the  majority  of  men  who  voted</span><span>  Hi  th©  last  flection  are  not  capitalists  or  in  favour  of  c^p</span></p> <p><span>  ital,  and  ""do  not'  iBelieve  m  the  rule  of  capital.

Badger,</span></p> <p><span>  the  ""straight""  employer  and  esteemed'citizen,  returns  to</span><span>  his  post  will  he  iind  fidelity  among-  his  employees  ?  When</span><span>  he  left  Brisbane  a  lew  months  ago  he  left  here  a  body  of</span><span>  employees  ^vho  declared  themselves  contented.  They  were</span><span>  working'  under  conditions  and  pay  fixed  by  a  legal  award,</span><span>  an  award  which  they  had  declared  righteous,  and  I  under</span><span>  stand  that  at  the  time  ol*  his  leaving  the  employees  by  their</span><span>  appointed  delegates  pledged  themselves  that  during  his  ab</span><span>  sence  nothing  should  be  done  by  them  to  disturb  the  har</span><span>  mony  which  existed  in  their  relations  with  him  as  repre</span></p> <p><span>  senting  their  employers.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  ETERNAL*  SNOW  of  Tasmania's  Mount  Wellington</span><span>  provides  the  sparkling  water  with  which  is  brewed  Tas</span></p> <p><span>  manian  Cascade  Ale.*</span></p> <p><span>  But,  Unless  Rumour  Lies,</span></p> <p><span>  something  ha.d  been  done  quite  contrary  to  that  pledge.</span><span>  A  small  number  of  those  pledged  employees  moved  for  the</span><span>  establishment  of  relations  with  a  body  of  men  in  the  s«utn,</span><span>  known  as  the  Federal  something,  and  that  movement  has</span><span>  resulted,  I  need  not  explain  by  what  stwps,  in  a  registration</span><span>  and  relation  which  is  potentially  a  distinct  breach  of  the</span><span>  pledge  said  to  have  been  given.  The  registration  was  fol</span><span>  lowed  by  the  hithercoming  from  the  south  of  a  peripatetic</span><span>  representative  of  an  organisation  which  may  involve  the</span><span>  Brisbane  men  in  quarrels  wliich  are  neither  their  own  nor  of</span></p> <p><span>  their  making.</span></p> <p><span>  My  Idea  is  this:</span></p> <p><span>  Assuming  a  muster  of  the  whole,  there  may  be  three  dis</span><span>  tinct  classes,  each  with  a  distinctive  appearance  when  they</span><span>  meet  Mr.  Badger's  eyes.  First,  the  small  body,  assuming</span><span>  there  be  such  a  remnant,  who  have  kept  their  honour  untar</span><span>  nished.  In  the  face  of  contumely  they  have  kept  their  fide</span><span>  lity  to  the  pledge  and  have  refused  to  bow  the  knee  to  the</span><span>  bully.  These  will  look  fairly  into  Mr.  Badger's  eyes,  and</span><span>  will  deserve  promotion.  Second,  a  body,  large  as  to  num</span><span>  bers,  who  did  not  join  in  the  initial  disloyal  actio»,  but</span><span>  who  subsequently  allowed  themselves  to  be  'persuaded""  to</span><span>  join  the  row  body,  and  by  so  doing  have  broken  their</span><span>  pledge.  These  will  manifest  some  emb-arrawnieut.  close</span><span>  akin  to  shame.  These  may  receive  favourable  considera</span><span>  tion.  The  rest,  also  a  large  body,  on  whoso  clicks  the</span><span>  brand  of  ""labour""  is  manifest-movers  in  the  disloyalty</span><span>  either  ^primarily  or  secondarily.  These  will  look  at  Mr.</span><span>  Badger  with  all  the  hardihood  of  the  -larrikin,  and  an  out</span><span>  sider  seeing  them  will  ask,  ""Are  these  worthy  of  the  ser</span></p> <p><span>  vice  ?""</span></p> <p><span>  Now  For  Contumely,</span></p> <p><span>  and  now  for  bare  knuckles.  I  have  been  credibly  in</span><span>  formed  that  bitter  contumely  is  poured  without  stint  on</span><span>  the  heads  of  the  unyielding  by  the  pact-breakers.  Words</span></p> <p><span>  and  acts  of  this  character  are  the  missiles  of  cowards  only.</span><span>  The  irony  of  the  position  in  this  case  lies  in  the  anxiety</span><span>  that  those  who  are  officers  of  the  union  shall  not  be  penal</span><span>  ised,  while  all  the  time  these  fallows  do  themselves  penalise</span><span>  men  who  refuse  to  join  the  new  organisation-a  very  lop</span><span>  sided  sort  of  justice  surelv.  On  one  point  ""Figaro""  would</span><span>  be  clear  and  is  immoveable.  Any  man  who  calls  a  fellow</span><span>  man  ""Scab""  or  ""blackleg""'  because  he  exercises  his  legal</span><span>  rights  by  refusing  to  join  any  union  deserves  to  be  lashed</span><span>  with  the  MSltonian  ""whip  of  scorpions.""

Our</span><span>  old  friend  Blatchford  is  pegging  away  again  on  the  subject</span><span>  of  Germany's  wicked  designs.  He  is  no  doubt  speaking  the</span><span>  truth,  but  to  the  slow-going  Englishman  the  veto  question</span><span>  of  the  Lords  is  a  far  more  important  thing  than  Germ  any'5</span><span>  hostile  intentions.  ""They  can  finish  the  veto  question  and</span><span>  lick  the  German  after,  if  necessary.""  Such  seems  to  be  the</span><span>  attitude.  Does  an  Englishman  ever  realise  he's  in  the  soup</span><span>  till  he  finds  himself  up  to  his  neck  in  it,  and  then  he  says</span><span>  ""walTor,""  and  when  the  English  nation  finds  itself  in  des</span><span>  perate  istraits  it  becomes  a  dangerous  beast  to  tackle.  It</span><span>  Is  then  put  on  its  mettle,  and  there's  no  surrender.  They'r</span><span>  so  stupid*  thefete  English  folkA  they  don't  know  when  they're</span></p> <p><span>  beaten.  Are  you  getting  sick  of  this  'Germany  business?</span><span>  Can  you  longer  stand  this  irritant  ?  Can  you  longer  keep,</span><span>  your  fingers  from  the  throat  of  this  rattler  of  the  sword.  ?</span><span>  I  say  that  Germany  wants  to  wipe  us  Britishers  out.  Will</span><span>  other  free  nations  stand  by  and  see  military  tyranny  take</span><span>  the  place  of  an  intellectual  leadership  which  makes  for  free</span><span>  dom  and  peace!  ?  Surely  the  world  is  large  enough  for</span><span>  friendly  competition  between  the  two  Powers.  But  Ger</span><span>  many,  it  seems,  does  not  want  friendly  rivalry,  but  slie</span><span>  wants  an  absolute  suppression  of  the  Britisher.  She  would</span><span>  wipe  out  his  language  and  make  him  learn  the  very  difficult</span><span>  German  with  its  ""he,  she,  it""  attached  to  all  and  sundry</span><span>  objects  without  rime  or  reason.  The  Anglo-Saxon  has</span><span>  weathered  many  a  storm  and  he's  not  done  yet  and  has  a</span><span>  lot  more  to  say  about  the  destinies  of  the  human  race  be</span></p> <p><span>  fore  he  takes  a  seat  at  the  back  of  the  hall.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  DIFFERENCE  between  Bailie  Nicol  Jar  vie  Whisky</span><span>  and  other  brands  is  in  the  former's  favour.*</span></p> <p><span>  The  American  Officer</span></p> <p><span>  speaking  at  a  dinner  in  London  said  some  stirring  things</span><span>  -the  Germans  called  them  4'vapourings""-such  things  that</span><span>  no  lover  of  freedom  could  help  saying.  No  one  in  the  world</span><span>  wants  to  have  Germany  the  supreme  power.  Modern  sen</span><span>  sible  people  of  higher  human  development  have  no  sympathy</span><span>  with  the  odious  military  system  of  Germany.  I  don't  think</span><span>  a  large  number  of  intellectual  Germans  have  any  sympathy</span><span>  with  it.  But  Germany  can  be  well  assured  that  no  sensible</span><span>  freedom-loving  nation  wants  the  hegemony  of  Germany.  It</span><span>  would  be  disastrous  to  humanity.  Can  any  nation  be  called</span><span>  sensible  that  tolerates  the  military  and  naval  burden  of  Ger</span><span>  many  ?  The  American  knows  what  freedom  from  the  mili</span><span>  tary  burden  is,  and  I  should  say  it  has  a  more  than  blood</span><span>  and  kindred  interest  in  helping  to  maintain  the  independency</span><span>  and  supremacy  of  Great  Britain  if  ever  the  necessity  should</span><span>  arise.  Why  should  the  German  think  the  officer's  speech</span><span>  ""an  unfriendly  act""  ?  Isn't  German  attitude  to  England</span><span>  more  than  unfriendly,  and  isn't  an  unfriendly  act  towards</span><span>  Britain  an  unfriendly  act  to  every  nation  and  man  that  ab</span><span>  hors  war  and  warlike  preparations  ?  And  every  act  which</span><span>  is  aimed  at  crushing  that  nation  which  ever  has  led  in  the</span><span>  ranks  of  intellect,  peace,  freedom,  and  when  need  be  in  feats</span><span>  of  arms,  is  ""an  unfriendly  act""  to  every  other  nation  which</span><span>  is  marching  in  England's  footsteps  and  ,seeks  a  destiny</span><span>  where  military  glory  will  be  a  thing  unknown  save  in  his</span><span>  torical  records  of  a  barbarous  past.  So  please,  Germany,</span><span>  cease  talking  of  ""unfriendly  acts.""  Practice  what  you</span><span>  preach  !  Let  intellect,  not  brute  strength,  prevail  !  Let</span><span>  the  art  of  reason  be  superior  to  the  art  of  throat  slitting</span><span>  or  jaw  punching.

The  scornful  epithets  used</span><span>  against  us  are  ''small,  ignorant,  and  impotent.""  ""Small""</span><span>  is  admitted.  We  know  we're  small,  but  we're  not  go'ing  to</span><span>  blaze  oir  weakness  forth  to  the  world.  It's  foolish  to</span><span>  show  possible  enemies  a  weak  spot.  Arnold  White  needn't</span><span>  gire  us  away  even  if  he  does  happen  to  know.  ""Impotent""</span><span>  we  must  ad»mit  also,  but  why  tell  us  what  we  know  and</span><span>  desire  to  keep  dark.  We  don't  admit  ""ignorance.""

WTe</span><span>  know  of  the  teeming  millions  of  China  and  of  America,  on</span><span>  either  side  of  Japan,  which  has  only  60  millions-a  small</span><span>  number  compared  with  China  and  America-and  we  .  know</span><span>  that  Japan  will  have  to  look  to  herself  from  dangers  near</span><span>  at  hand  in  the  not  distant  future.  There's  China,  Russia,</span><span>  and  America,  with  enormous  populations,  right  round  Ja</span><span>  pan.  Russia  wants  something  back,  so  does  China.

The  Governor-General  (Lord  Denman)  officiated</span><span>  at  the  opening.  There  were  also  present  Lady  Denman  and</span><span>  suite,  the  State  Governor  (Sir  John,  Fuller)  and  Lady</span><span>  Fuller)-.  The  show  is  said  to  have  established  a  record,  en</span><span>  tries  in  all  classes  being  beyond  expectations.  A  very  de</span><span>  sirable  innovation  was  the  establishment  thereat  oi  a  kin</span><span>  dergarten  creche,  on  the  same  lines  as  that  advocated  r>y  the</span><span>  Women  S  Exhibition  a  few  year  A  ago.  The  creche  was  wel)</span><span>  patronised,  the  youngest  charge  being  six  weeks  old.  The</span><span>  children  were  well  fed  and  received  -every  attention  and  made</span><span>  a  Very  happy  little  picture,  surrounded  by  numerous  toys.</span><span>  A  small  sum  of  threepence  was  charged  per  child.  .

The  opening  of  the  Federal  Parlia</span><span>  ment  took  place  on  Tuesday.  On  this  occasion  the  ceremony</span><span>  was  almost  devoid  of  ancient  formalities,  so  much  so  that</span><span>  not  even  the  ma?e  was  allowed  to  be  placed  on  the  table,</span><span>  which  probably  is  the  first  time  an  Australian  historv  when</span><span>  this  important  atlftnGt  has  been  absent.

Doctor  of  Laws</span><span>  hanioris  causa,  as.  they  put  it,  and  he  looked  well  in  a  jbk'ava</span><span>  costume  of  red  and  blue.  When  Michie  presented  Kidston</span><span>  to  MacGrregor  one  would  not  have  prowled  if  h£  had  spoken</span></p> <p><span>  in  Gaelic,  but  when  he  had  recourse  to  a  dead  lingo,  to  .</span><span>  wit,  Latin,  whidh  not  one  per  centum  in  the  audience  under*</span><span>  stood,  including  the  person  presented,  we  felt  satisfied  we</span><span>  were  still  in  the  rut  of  old  time  and  the  fetish  Latin,  could</span><span>  not  be  dispenis~d  with.  It  is,  to  put  it  mildly,  extremely</span><span>  bad  taste  and  a  lit  tile  pedantic  to  talk  in  a  language  not</span><span>  understood  by  those  present.  The  Philistine  that  is  writing</span><span>  is  not  unread  in  Latin;  he  has  spent  a  good  few  weary  hours</span><span>  with  Virgil  and  was  sorry  the  old  humbug  didn't  bum  the</span><span>  M.S.,  and  it  would  have  been  better  if  ffe  had  written  his</span><span>  agricultural  and  horticultural  treatises  in  prose,  instead  of</span><span>  versa.  Ciceio  K.C.  made  a  lot  of  money  and  some  fine</span><span>  speeches  in  defendiing  and  prosecuting  some  sncient  scoun</span><span>  drels  of  his  time.  He  tried  his  hand  on  philosophy.  Old</span><span>  Caesar  wrote  a  lot  of  complimentary  things  about  himself</span><span>  and  his  clemency  in  a  work  he  called  De  Bello  galico.  Livy</span><span>  also  wrote  up  the  history  of  his  race.  The  comedies  of</span><span>  Plautus  arid  Ieri^nce  remind  us  what  serious  people  the</span><span>  Latin  spea'dgg  people  were.  It  is  probably  hard  to  be</span><span>  funny  in  Latin.  ""What  a  fiend  !  ""  the  University  man  will</span><span>  say,  ""he's  trying  to  show  off  his  little  knowledge  of  ^our'</span><span>  language.""  Not  so  ;  this  Philistine  merely  desines  to  say</span><span>  that  he  has  had  a  good  browse  in  the  Latin  garden  and  is</span></p> <p><span>  quite  satisfied  that  anything  that  can  be  said  in  Latin  can  &lt;</span><span>  ba  equally  well  (if  not  better)  said  in  English.  It's  a  good</span><span>  job  the  iate  William  Shakespeare  was  not  a  University</span></p> <p><span>  man  ;  his  English  might  have  suffered.  That  is  assuming,  3</span><span>  Shakespeare  was  Shakespeare.</span></p> <p><span>  With  a  good  many  University  men  the  atmosphere  of  the</span><span>  old  Universities  is  on  them  and  they  are  unconscious  of  it.</span><span>  With  them  it's  ""odi  profanum  vulgus  et  arceo,""  ""vulgus""</span><span>  meaning-  anybody  not  a  University  man.

This</span><span>  week's  bill,  on  the  whole,  is  perhaps  not  quite  so  good  as</span><span>  la  t  week's,  still  its  eighteen  carat  value  and  the  one  who</span><span>  wants  the  twenty-two  carat  article  each  and  every  time  is</span><span>  simply  not  going  to  get  it-even  though  he  imagines  he  is</span><span>  -for  either  love  or  money  in  this  vale  of  smiles  and  tears-.</span><span>  The  second  half  of  the  programme  this  week  contains  the</span><span>  usual  variety  of  ""turns''-fay  both  new  and  old  artists,  and</span><span>  the  ""old""  artists'  ""new""  contributions  are  equal  to  those</span><span>  of  the  newcomers.  For  instance,  the  sketch,  ""The  Brick</span><span>  layer  and  his  Labourer,""  by  Brown  and  Robinson,  and  the</span><span>  comjedy,  ""The  100  to  1  chance,""  by  Graham  and  Dent  are</span><span>  quite  equal  to  anything  else  on  the  bill.

AT  WEST'S.-A  good  deal  has</span><span>  been  sard  and  written  of  the  uses  and  abuses  of  the  cine</span></p> <p><span>  matograph  ;  but  there  can  be  no  two  opinions  when  th&lt;e</span><span>  wonderful  invention  is  utilised  to  bring  before  Australian</span><span>  audiences  the  finished  representations  of  Shakespeare's  art</span><span>  as  produced  by  Sir  Herbert  Beerbohin  Tree,  and  his  talented</span><span>  English  companies.  Much  praise  is  due  to  the  management</span><span>  of  West's  Olympia  for  having  secured  such  a  splendid  film</span><span>  as  that  presented  during  the  week,  depicting  this  famous</span><span>  organisation  in  ""King  Heniiy  VIII.""  That  the  public  .ap</span><span>  preciate  the  enterprise  was  well  exemplified  by  the  crowded</span><span>  houses  oil  each  occasion.  The  scenery,  the  costuming,  and</span><span>  every  detail  of  the  historic  drama  were  shown  as  they  have</span><span>  hitherto  been  seen  only  in  London.  There  was  a  pleasure,</span><span>  too,  in  the  fact  that  the  figures  seen  upon  the  screen  were</span><span>  those  of  such  wor^d-famous  actors  and  actresses  as  Sir</span><span>  Herbert  Tree,  Mr.  A.  B'ourchier,  Edward  Sass,  Misses  Vio</span></p> <p><span>  let  V&nbrfcigh  and  Laura  Cowie.  Another  big  attraction  was</span><span>  the  revival  of  the  sensational  Parisian  drama,  ""The  Red</span><span>  Hand,""  which  held  the  attention  of  the  large  audience  from</span><span>  start  to  finish.  These  big  features  were  supported  by  a</span><span>  fine  collection  of  general  pictures,  among  them  being  such,</span><span>  splendid  films  as  ""The  Smallest  Pony  in  the  World/'</span><span>  ""Heart  of  a  Savage,""  ""Price  of  Victory,""  ""(retting  Evens,""</span><span>  ""Winter  Life  in  Scandinavia,""  and  ""A.

""A  Bad  Man's  Downfall""</span><span>  presented  a  powerful  dramatic  story  of  the  early  days  in</span><span>  the  Far  West  of  the  United  States.  The  principal  charac</span><span>  ters  were  a  detective  on  the  trail  of  a  man  who  is  ""want</span><span>  ed,""  and  the  bully  of  the  township.  The  arrival  of  a  pretty</span><span>  schoolmistress  made  the  course  of  affairs  take  a  romantic</span><span>  turn,  and  the  sjtory  increased  in  interest.  The  two  men</span><span>  were  rivals  for  the  affection  of  the  school  mistress,  and  she,</span><span>  not  wishing  to  cause  any  disruption,  did  not  reject  the  ad</span><span>  vances  of  the  bully.  The  climax  was  reached  in  dramatic</span><span>  fashion.  The  detective  received  a  message  that  the  man  who'</span><span>  is  wanted  is  M'Grew,  the  bully.  Receiving  a  challenge  to</span><span>  fiight  from  M'Grew,  the  detective  accepted  with  alacrity,</span><span>  which  ensued  tended,  as  was  stated,  in  the  title  of  the  piece.</span><span>  Anothier  equally  powerful  drama  was  '''The  Secret  of  his</span><span>  They  met  in  the  bar  of  the  hotel,  and  a  fierce  struggle</span><span>  Past.""

Railway  work</span><span>  ing,  management,  and  construction  became  part  of  his</span><span>  nature,  his  soul  entered  into  the  railways  of  Queensland,</span><span>  which  bear  the  impress  of  his  wit  and  character.  Thallon</span><span>  was  a  great  administrator,  entirely  without  show  or  osten</span><span>  tation,  a  man  easy  of  access  and  quite  approachable,  he</span><span>  knew  human  nature,  and  was  tolerant  of  its  weaknesses,</span><span>  his  rangle  of  practical  knowledge  was  wide,  and  his  literary</span><span>  taste  was  bound  up  in  the  marvellous  productions  of  his</span><span>  world-famed  compatriot,  Sir  Walter  Scott,  in  which  are</span><span>  found  a  wealth  and  diversity  of  character.  Scotch,  Bng</span><span>  1  sh,  continental,  from  prince  to  pauper.  One  equipped  with</span><span>  a  strand  and  intimate  knowledge  of  his  Scott  as  Thallon</span><span>  was,  went'  amongst  his  fellow  men  and  women  with  a  fund</span><span>  of  infiormation,  the  value  of  which  is  inestimable.  'Thallon</span><span>  was  an  unassuming  modest  man,  and  knew  so  much  that!  he.</span><span>  was  assured  of  how  little  he  knew.  This  knowledge  of  how</span><span>  little  one  knowt  is  onl&lt;y  vouchsafed  to  those  who  know</span><span>  much.  Those  only  who  know  a  little  are  apt  to  imagine</span><span>  they  know  much  beqause  the  circle  of  their  knowledge  is  so</span><span>  small  that  they  can  see  all  around  it  in  a  glance  and  thiink</span><span>  ehat  the  sum  of  human  knowledge  is  encompassed  in  thaT</span><span>  narrow  horizon.  He  was  a  firm  administrator  and  knew</span><span>  how  to  have  1  is  way;  because  he  was  convinced  it  was  the</span><span>  right  way,  and  the  practical  way.  He  was  the  father  of</span><span>  his  grieat  department,  the  greatest  perhaps  in  the  State.</span></p> <p><span>  He  treated  all  under  his  rule  w,ith  justice  and  patience  that</span><span>  a  father  me^ts  out  to  an  erring  child.  Praise  came  where</span><span>  it  .was  merited,  but  not  fulsome  or  extravagant  courtesy</span><span>  was  his  conspicuous  attribute,  and  he  drew  from  his  subor</span><span>  dinates  a  willing  obedience  and  undisguised  affection  by</span><span>  tho?e  endearing  and  lovable  qualities  that  I  have  referred</span><span>  to,  and  the  aU'J/ec/tion  of  his  subordinates  and  fellow  railway</span><span>  officials  was  manifested  by  a  keen  wave  of  sorrow  that</span><span>  swept  over  the  whole  of  the  railway  service  as  it  did  over</span><span>  Queensland.  It  is  difficult  to  express  the  sorrow  that  one</span></p> <p><span>  feels  at  his  untimely  end,  and  ''Figaro""  wishes  to  convey</span><span>  to  his  fam  ly  its  entire  sympathy.</span></p> <p><span>  The  41  Harum  Scarum'""  Skirt.</span></p> <p><span>  A  great  deal  of  fuss  is  made  out  of  this  new  brand  or</span><span>  feminine  inanity.  It  came  to  Brisbane,  and  if  the  people</span><span>  of  this  good  city  had  shown  any  sense  they  would  have</span><span>  taken  absolutely  no  notice  of  the  individuals,,  who  wore  it,</span><span>  and  would  have  let  them  go  on  in  their  owii  insignificant</span><span>  way,  and  refused  to  give  them  a  bubble  notoriety,  which</span><span>  they  were  seeking  after,  at,  we  are  to  I'd,  two  pounds  for  ttoa.</span><span>  afternoon  parade.  ''Harem""  for  a  start,  is  an  objection</span><span>  able  epithet,  in  one  man  one  wife  communities.  It  recalls</span><span>  a  crtowd  of  idle  women  kept  like  pets  in  a  cage,  not  to  be</span><span>  handled  or  touched  by  anyone  save  their  owners,  who.^re</span><span>  usually  fat  voluptuaries  and  generally  persons  whom  we</span><span>  lsok  upon  with  a  certain  amount  of  odium  and  contempt</span><span>  that  is,  western  contempt.

This  unpaid,  selfi</span><span>  appointed  pilot  of  sfhips  into  Wellington.  Poor  Jack's</span><span>  time  has  come,  he  has  put  on  immortality,  his  genial  squl</span><span>  has  joined  the  finny  host  in  the  Walhalla  of  the  denizens  of</span></p> <p><span>  tlho  sea.  This  solitary  fish  seemingly  had  no  mates  ;  he</span><span>  probably  i's  the  las^t  of  his  race.  He  lias  been  reported</span><span>  dead  before,  but  the  alarm  was  false.  He  looks  upon  ships</span><span>  as  his  playthings  and  came  to  meet  them  and  offer  them</span><span>  a  welcome  to  his  home  and  haunts.  Did  he  expect  to  find</span><span>  in  these  ships  his  (or  her)  lost  mate.  As  a  crown  of</span><span>  distinction,  this  best  known  fish  of  all  time,  save  perhaps,</span><span>  .Johan's  mythical  whale,  or  the  ancient  dolphin  that  ferried</span><span>  some  ancient  gentleman  across  the  Grecian  main,  was</span><span>  solemnly  prot^ted  by  an  act  of  Parliament.

And  the  spirit  of  that  untiring  fish  will  haunt  those</span><span>  parts  and  be  remembered  for  many  years  and  perhaps  his</span><span>  ways  and  acts  will  become  a  legendv  And  ""who  knoweth</span><span>  the  spirit  of  the  beast  (or  fish)  that  goeth  downwards  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  earth  ?""</span></p> <p><span>  Referenda.</span></p> <p><span>  iQneenslanjd's  puMic  men  are  rousing  up  the  people  of</span><span>  Queensland  to  a  sense  of  the  true  innerness  of  those  inno</span><span>  cent  propositions.

Barton</span><span>  and  Deakin  before  federation  came  about  said  ""Can't  you</span><span>  trust,""  and  we  did,  but  they  immediately  tackled  poor</span><span>  Queensland's  sugar  industry,  kicked  out  the  w  Id  kanaka,</span><span>  but  left  the  chow  and  the  Hindu  and  oither  objectionables</span><span>  to  flourish  here.  Some  one  has  reasonably  said  we  may</span><span>  as  well  be  ruled  from  Downing  Street  as  from  some  street</span><span>  in  Melbourne,  for  assuredly  as  the-referenda  is  carried  we</span><span>  become  as  I  said  before,  an  ""impotent  nerveless  appanage""</span><span>  to  the  South  from  which  fifty  years  ago  owing  to  neglect</span><span>  and  want  of  appreciation  of  our  aims  and  progress  on  $he</span><span>  paift  of  our  then  rulers  in  thie  south  we,  after  a  long</span><span>  struggle  at  length  began  to  rule  ourselves  and  have  forged</span><span>  steadily  ahead,  and  all  this  good  work  is  to  be  reversed,</span><span>  and  we  are  asked  to  hand  over  this  territory  and;  become</span><span>  vassals  of  the  south.  Something  like  King  John  handing</span><span>  over  England!  to  the  Pope  and  receiving  it  badk  as  a  vassal</span><span>  of  the  Papacy.  There  may  be  another  Kunnvrnede  and</span><span>  another  Charter  of  Liberties  for  Queensland.

The  tragedy  of  the  ship  Gothenberg  in  1875</span><span>  in  these  parts  is  recalled.  Both  vessels  were  overtaken  by</span><span>  hurricanes.  The  Gothenberg  was  piled  up  on  the  reefs  and</span><span>  some  were  saved,  but  the  Yongala,  as  far  as  known  to-day,</span><span>  is  not  on  any  reef,  and  the  horrible  thought  is*  that  she  has</span><span>  gone  down  with  all  her  human  cargo.

"<p><span>  MELBOURNE.-This  city  has  been  visited  with  very</span><span>  changeable  weather,  and  Thursday's  storm  was  felt  most</span><span>  severely  in  many  of  the  suburbs.  The  epidemic  of  influ</span><span>  enza  is  slowly:abating,  ?,and  business,  theatres,  etc.,  are  pro</span><span>  ceeding  in  their  general  routine.  Miss  Winifred  O'Connor,</span><span>  of  ""The  Chocolate  Soldier""  Co.,  has  been  confined  to  her</span><span>  room  for  a  fortnight,  but  took  up  her  role  on.  Monday</span><span>  evening,  when  she  received  a  great  welcome.  The  ap</span><span>  pointment  of  Mr.  Schwieger  to  the  position  of  secretary  to</span><span>  the  Royal  Agricultural  Show  is  very  popular.  To  mark  the</span><span>  committee's  appreciation  of  this  gentleman  and  his  wife's</span><span>  efforts  at  the  recent  show,  handsome  presentations  iwere</span><span>  made  to  each  respectively  in  recognition  of  same.  Miss</span><span>  Margaret  Baskerville's  tender  for  the  execution  of  a  ibronze</span><span>  statue  in  memory  of  the  late  Sir  Thomas  Bent  has  been</span><span>  accepted.  Under  the  auspices  of  the'  Field  Naturalists'</span><span>  Association,  an  interesting  exhibition  of  wil'dflowers,  nat</span><span>  ural  history,  such  as  shells,  birds,  and  insects,  was  held  on</span><span>  Wednesday,  and  proved  an  unqualified  success.  In  the</span><span>  evening  ledtures  on  geology  and  birds  were  given,  which</span><span>  wore  listened  to  by1  an  appreciative  audience.  Oiver</span><span>  40,000  people  witnessed  the  final  football  match  Essendon</span><span>  v.  Cjollingwood  on  Saturdayr  when  the  former  were  victor</span><span>  ious.  His  Excellency  the  Governor  and  Lady  Fuller  were</span><span>  amongst  the  interested  spectators.  The  fortnightly  meet</span><span>  ing  of  the  Arts  and  Graftal  Society  was  held  on  Tuesday,</span><span>  when  a  very  interesting  collection  of  bookbinding,  enamel</span><span>  ling,  and  metal  work  was  shown.  These  exhibitions  ^re</span><span>  held  fortnightly,  the  public  being  invited  free,  and  are  be</span><span>  coming  very  popular.  A  very  successful  Juvenile  poster</span><span>  and  fancy  dress  ball  was  given  at  Menzies  Hotel  on  Saturd</span><span>  day  evening.  The  proceeds  are  to  be  -given  to  the  Child</span><span>  ren's  Hospital.  Considering  that  the  ticket^  were  10s.  each</span><span>  Child,  that  institution  should  benefit  greatly  thereby.  Mr.</span><span>  Norman  gratuitously  defrayed  expenses,  and  Miss  Florrie</span><span>  Green,  the  popular  teacher  of  dancing,  undertook  the  direc</span><span>  tion  of  the  items  of  the  programme  throughout,  to  whom</span><span>  too  much  praise  cannot  be  given.  This  lady  is  foremost  in</span><span>  offering  her  services  free  in  all  the  leading  charitable  move</span><span>  ments.  Many  of  her  pupils  are  holding  leading  position  on</span><span>  the  stage.  In  competitions  her  pupils  score  heavily.  There</span><span>  were  about  500  children  present,  and  about  200  adults.</span><span>  Many  pretty  costumes  were  worn-,  the  first  prize  being  one</span><span>  by  Miss  Noel  Canney,  who  represented  Cobra  boot  polish</span><span>  (Nubian  girl)  with  cobras,  with  gleaming  eyes  entwined</span><span>  about  her.  Mr.  Arthur  Garland  as  an  Indian  chief  also</span><span>  secured  a  prize.  Many  pretty  sets  were  to  be  seen,  includ</span><span>  ing  the  toreador  set,  Kate  Grenaway  set.  Miss  Mollie  Wall</span><span>  represented  the  Merry;  Widow,  Mr.  Frank  Goddard  Monsieur</span><span>  Beaucaire,  Miss  Lilias  McKillop,  the  pretty  little  fair</span><span>  haired  eight-year-old  daughter  of  Mrs.  H.  D.  McKillop,  m-adgi</span><span>  a  sweet  picture  as  ""Queensland  Figaro  and  P'unch.""  Her</span><span>  costume  was  of  white  -and  cerise  satin,  gold  lace  and  trim</span><span>  mings.  Miss  Thyrza  Coles,  as  ""Golden  Butterfly,""  was  an</span><span>  other  beautiful  child.  It  would  take  pag^es  to  write  up  all</span><span>  the  costumes,  especially  when  one  considers  that  there  were</span><span>  very  few  duplicates.  Mr,  and  Mrs.  Menzies'  kindly  action</span><span>  will  ever  be  remembered,  and  should  prove  an  incentive  to</span><span>  many  others  of  our  citizens  to  follow  this  self  sacrificing</span><span>  and  arduous  task  tin  the  help  of  such  a  worthy  cause  as  the</span><span>  Children's  Hospital.  The  pretty  seaside  suburb  of  Brigh</span><span>  ton  held  its  annual  carnival  on  Wednesday  .with  great  suc</span><span>  cess.  This  carnival  has  been  held  regularly  for  over  40</span><span>  years,  and  .though  many  other  suburbs  have  organised  sim</span><span>  ilar  functions  at  various  times,  they  have  lacked  support</span><span>  and  consequently  fallen  through.

Miss  Violet</span><span>  King's  selections  on  the  violin  were  most  acceptable,  and</span><span>  Miss  Nelly  Kenny's  mezzo-soprano  showed  to  advantage  in</span><span>  two  songs,  ""Three""  and  -""Your  Love,""  though  in  ""Love's</span><span>  Coronation""  an  inclination  to  drag  was  slightly  evident.</span><span>  Mr.  W.

Lambert,  a  baritone  of  promise,  sang,</span><span>  in  addition  to-  a  duet  with  Mr.  Crisp,  some  rollicking  num</span><span>  bers  in  good  style,  and  more  suited  to  his  attainment^  than</span><span>  Lohr's  compositions  ''You  loved  the  time  of  violets""  and</span><span>  ""Youth  has  a  happy  tread,""  two  bracketed  items.

I  have  a  notion</span><span>  that  much  of  the  talk  of  unworking  men  when  ar^  ludi</span><span>  crously  labelled  ""labour""  is  contemptible  cant.</span><span>  ""  People  Must  Be  Free</span></p> <p><span>  to  sell  their  labour  without  let  or  hindrance.""  So</span><span>  said  Mr.  Fisher  in  London  in  the  hearing  of  men  who-  have</span><span>  some  idea  of  the  rights  of  man,  and  not  before  the  Mine</span><span>  han  crowd  who  have  no  such  idea,  except  a  lop-sided  one,</span><span>  which  recogmises  ""people""  and  ""unionists""  as  -  synonymous</span><span>  terms.  The  dictum  was  applauded,  as  it  deserved,  but  Mr.</span><span>  Fisher  dare  not  say  the  same  right  thing  here.  The  word</span><span>  ""let""'from  th*  Anglo-Saxon  has  two  meanings-to  hinder</span><span>  or  hindrance,  and  to  permit.  So  that  whichever  of  the</span><span>  two  we  take  the  deliverance  is  right.  It  means  ""People</span><span>  must,  be  free  to  sell  their  labour  without  obstacle  or  hin</span><span>  drance,""  or  ""People  must  be  free  to  sell  their  lahiour  with</span><span>  out'  seeding  ^nmission.""  .Either  is  right.

But</span><span>  xno^e  important  than  either  is  the  matter  of  safety  in  the</span><span>  aftl?r  life.  There  ar,0  many  teachers  who  profess  to  declare</span><span>  the  only  belief  by  which  that  safety  can  be  secured.  I  take</span><span>  snly  two  for  my  present  purpose-the  Protestant  and  the</span></p> <p><span>  Rctojian  Catholic.  Let  us  s'uppose  adherents  of  the  former,</span><span>  arc&ntly  desirous  to  save  souls  by  fche  means  by  which  they</span><span>  brieve  that  safety  can  be  secured,  in  order  to  effectively</span><span>  snatch  ''brands  from  the  burning""  picket  St.  Stephen's  Ca</span><span>  tlijMral,  intercept  intending  worshippers,  and  endeavour  by</span><span>  ""peaceful  persuasion""  to  induce  them  to  go  elsewhere  to</span><span>  find;  the  truth.

This  is</span><span>  their  view  of  themselves.  I,  however,  do  not  hold  these</span><span>  views.  I  haven't  yet  placed  the  unionist  on  the  pedestal</span><span>  and  bowed  down  and  scraped.  I  look  upon  him  as*  just</span><span>  an  ordinary  being,  no  better  nor  worse  than  the  next  man,</span><span>  and  qluite  incapafble  of  taking  an  impartial  view  where</span><span>  unionism  is  concerned  when  it  gets  into  conflict  with  capi</span><span>  tal.  They  want  to  be  judge.,  jury,  and  witnesses  in  their</span><span>  own  case.  No  one  can  honestly  hold  a  contrary  view  to</span><span>  them  ;  it's  impossible.  I  conceive  that  brains  were  given</span><span>  us  to  think,  to  reason,  to  weigh  arguments,  to  test  facts,</span><span>  and  to  form  a  fair  judgement  in  any  given  seit  of  facts.</span><span>  But  unionism  won't  tolerate  it.  It's  something  like  the</span><span>  church  in  the  middle  ages.  If  you  are  not  with  the</span><span>  unionists  you  are  against  them,  and  other  nonsense  of  this</span><span>  kind.  There  are  more  Ways  to  heaven  than  one,  and  there</span><span>  are  more  ways  of  looking  at  a  dispute  than  one,  ami  the</span><span>  sooner  union'shn  remembers  it  the  better.

The  leading  lady</span><span>  had  a  marked  propensity  of  addressing  her  lines  to  the  audience</span><span>  instead,  of  to  the  characters  who  were  associated  with  her.  On</span><span>  one  evening,  however,  this  particular  habit  led  to  a  little  incident</span><span>  w""hich  forever  cured  the  star  of  addressing  her  audience.  She</span><span>  was  on  in  a  sccne  with  the  villain,  who  was  trying  to  make  love</span><span>  to  her,  and  following  her  usual  custom  she  stood  right  at'  the</span><span>  footlights  and  declared  emphatically  :  ""  I  cah  never  love  you.""</span><span>  A  youth  in  evening  dress  who  had  just  come  in  from  some  convivial</span><span>  dinner  party,  and  who  was  consequently  somewhat  unsteady  in</span><span>  his  gait,  was  just  taking  off  his  cloak  preparatory  to  seating  himself</span><span>  in  the  front  stalls,  when  this  emphatic  statement  greeted  his  ears.</span><span>  He  turned  to  the*  actress,  and  in  an  audible  voice  said  :  ""  Well,</span><span>  that  settles  it,""  and  putting  on  his  cloak  again  walked  out  of  the</span><span>  theatre.  The  audience  enjoyed  the  joke  hugely,  but  the  star</span><span>  decided  that  she  would  confine  her  remarks  to  the  members  of</span><span>  the  company  in  future.</span></p> <p><span>  Mrs.  Alec.

Mr.  Jack  Cannot  as  ""Dame</span><span>  Trot,""  was  really  excellent,  and  upon  him  fell  the  fun  of</span><span>  the  evening.  Mr.  Cannot  changes  his  costume  many  times,</span><span>  noneof  which  was  the  writer  least  envious  of.  Mr.  Cannot</span><span>  sang  many  songs,  but  the  one  of  all  was  ""La  La  La,""  in</span><span>  which  he  invited  all  the  Lizzie's  and  younrr  m?n  resent  to</span><span>  join  inthe  chorus.

The  witty  sayings,</span><span>  the  catchy  songs,  and  withal  all  the  clever  dancing  is  worth</span><span>  the  entrance  money  alone.

After  the  meeting,  in  which</span><span>  the  by  Sinews  of  the  year  was  discussed,  Mr.  Holds  worth,</span><span>  who  took  the  chair,  in  a  very  short  speech  said  how  very</span><span>  much  he  an^  the  members  of  the  congregation  ncisirfctted  hja</span><span>  \tn^  to'©art  With  Mr.  Price,,  and  they  had  decided  to  em</span><span>  body  thpir  tfpe'iners  in  an  adidress,  which  they  were  going  to</span><span>  present  to  Mrj.

The  addrjess  was  then  read,  and  on  conclusion  of.  the</span><span>  reading,  Mr.  Holldsworth,  on  behalf  of  himself  and  the  con</span><span>  gregation,  wished  Mr.  Ptfice  ood-bye  and  good  luck.""</span><span>  Mr.  Price,  in  replying,  -  saM  he  did  not  know  one  bit  how</span><span>  to  thank  them,  but  nevertheless,  he  d  d  so  most  sincerely</span><span>  and  heartily..  It  seemed  to  him  that  he  had  spent  the  best</span><span>  part  of  his  life  here,  and  it  wias  with  ver^y  great  regret</span><span>  he  was  forced  to  sever  his  connection  with  them  all.  He</span><span>  co  jId  look  b'ack  upo'n  many  happy  days  here-  Not  only</span><span>  was  this  liand  beautiifu'li,  but  he  had  made  so  many  frie.i  is</span><span>  an-d  received  so  many  kindnesses  here  that  wherever  o</span><span>  went  he  couljd  never  hope  to  again  meet  with  s>uch  go  ;  I</span><span>  kind  people,  who  were  always  ready  to  welcome  him.  At</span><span>  the  same  t:me  he  thought  it  was  a  good  thing  to  have</span><span>  changes  now  and  again,  though  it  was  sometimes  unpleas</span><span>  ant.  It  was  li'te  the  re-potting  of  a  plant;  He  thought</span><span>  it  was  a  good  thing  for  people  to  be  repotted  ;  at  any</span><span>  r&te,  it  was  something  he  was  going  through,  and  would</span><span>  be  a-b>le  to  see  whajt  kind  of  flowers  and  trees  were  produced</span><span>  He  had  no  plans  lor  the  future,  but  would  sees  what  was</span><span>  offering  n  the  Anglican  Church  at  home.  If  he  was}  allow,</span><span>  ed  to  do  so  he  could  take  up  the  work  again,  but  ifl  not  he</span><span>  wouljd  find  something  else.  At  tbjj  same  .t'inie  his  heart  was</span><span>  in  the  ministry,  and  he  would  sooner  spent  his  life  in  the</span><span>  work  than  do  anything  e\se.  Alter  thanking  his  congrega</span><span>  tion  for  the  beautiful  add  re-s  and  purse  of  sovereigns,  Mr.</span><span>  PHice  said  if  ever?  a  way  opened,  but  he  did  not  think""  it</span><span>  likelfr,  he  wou$d  only  be  too  lappy  to  return  and  live  once</span><span>  (more  n  s'unny  Quiaensland.

Although  the  attempt,  may  be  regarded  as  rather  an</span><span>  ambitious  one  still  the  result  achieved  proves  conclusively</span><span>  that  Brisbane  possesses  among  its  amateur  ranks  consid</span><span>  erable  latent  talent,  which,  given  opportunity,  will  no</span><span>  doubt  rapidly  develop.  The  society  is  most  fortunate  in</span><span>  possessing  so  capable  and  experienced  a  director  as  ^VLr.</span><span>  Ohas.

In  the  absence  of  her  mother,  Miss  Morag</span><span>  JackJon  welcomed  her  guests  on  their  arr  val.  Seats:  were</span><span>  arrayed  in  the;  lovely  large  drawing-room,  wh  ch  was  gaily</span><span>  decorated  with""  dahlias  of  every  colour.  The  meeting  was</span><span>  opened  by  a  hymn,  played  by  Miss  Joan  Har»t,  after  which</span><span>  the  Archbishop  addressed  the  girls,  saying  that  some  man</span><span>  toad  asked  him  why  he  thought  it  necessary-for  they</span><span>  were  as  good  as  posslibly  already.  The  ctfuesltion  he  wanted</span><span>  to  ask  tjhem  was,  what  were  they  going  to  be  in  10  or  12</span><span>  years'  time.  Everything  depended  on  the  girl  of  to-day.</span><span>  He  saw  before  him  girls  who  would  become  leaders  of  so</span><span>  ciety  and  fill  very  important  positions  in  Brisbane.  He</span><span>  wanted  to  discuss  and  form  aims  for  their  lives  ;;  thjey  were</span><span>  all  at  a  period  when  they  were  wakening  to  consciousness.</span><span>  The  first  thing  a  girl  on  the  threshhold  of  womanhood  was</span><span>  cons^ous""'o£  was  the  immense  ainount  of  sorrow,  sin,  and</span><span>  suffering  there  was  in  the  world,  and  this  came  as  a  great</span><span>  shock  to  all,  especially  those  who  lived  sheltered  lives.</span><span>  Then  His  Grace  quoted  two  short  stories.  He  urged  all  to</span><span>  be  content  with  their  own  -equipment  and  not  allow  jeal</span><span>  ousy  to  spoil  their  own  and  other  lives,  and  to  make  the</span><span>  best  of  what  they}  ihad.  He  also  urged  upon  all  preslent  to</span><span>  ta'-e  up  phys  cal  exercise  and  principally  to  exercise  the</span><span>  mind.  Li:fe  did  not  begin  to  be  interesting  till  we  exercised</span><span>  our  minds.  He  considered  that  soine,  not  all  of  them,  did</span><span>  not  use  their  minds,  and  they  must  excuse  his  plain  speak</span><span>  ing.  He  also  spoke  very  strongly  of  the  whirl  of  brooks  that</span><span>  weiie  being  .published  and  circiilajted,  which,  he*  considered,</span><span>  nasty,  low,  dirty  books,  and  urged  his  hearers  if  they  came</span><span>  across  books  or  reading  that  they  felt  they  wanted  to  wash</span><span>  their  minds  out,  to  throw  it  in  the  fire,  not  pass  it  on  to</span><span>  someone  else.  His  Grace  had  a  list  of  the  most  fascinat</span><span>  ingbooks  which  would  make  their  lives  richer  and  fjujller..</span><span>  He  iaid  w-biiien  w  elded  a  very  great  powfer  over  men,  and</span><span>  youiig  women  could  do  much  to  mould  the  characters  of</span><span>  young  men  ;  theyj  should  not  abuse  this  power  by  a  selfish</span><span>  love  of  admirati  on,  for  if  a  girl's  sole  aim  was  to  liiake</span><span>  Wen  admira  them,  they  wotold  not  admire  them  loAg.  His</span><span>  Grace  then  cbndemned  girls  who  outraged  the</span><span>  Conventions  of  v  society,  which  he  said,  were  not</span><span>  nearly  so  strict  ais  they  Were  in  the  days  of  our  grand  mo</span><span>  thers'  and'  great  ^attdfctthersi,  His  Grace  concluded  y</span></p> <p><span>  showing  the  practical  way  in  which  girls  could  enter  on.</span><span>  work  which  was  urgently  needed.  Mrs.  Pattinson  proposed</span><span>  to  forma  reading.e(lub,  and  would  be  pleased  to  receive  the</span><span>  names  of  those  willing  to  join.  Mrs.  Bedfond  urged  the</span><span>  claims  of  creche  and  kindergarten  work,  and  his  Grace  said</span><span>  that  workers  would  be  required  to  give  simple  Bible  lessons</span><span>  in  the  State  schools.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  address  a</span></p> <p><span>  hymn  was  sung  ^nd  a  prayer  said,  after  which  Miss  Jackson,</span><span>  entertained  her  guests  at  tea  under  the-large  trees  in  lie</span><span>  garden.

It  was  not  merely  an  overflowing  house,,  but  that</span><span>  in  addition  left  many  lamenting  its  restrictions  in  the  mat</span><span>  ter  of  accommodation-.  It  was  the  first  time  that  her  own</span></p> <p><span>  country  Have  had  an  opportunity  of  hearing  their  Queen  of</span><span>  Song  in  opera  and  the  people  have  been  yearning  for  the</span><span>  opportunity  for  years.  So  it  followed  that  there  was  never</span><span>  before  such  an  overwhelming  demand  for  admission  to  one</span><span>  theatre  as  there  was  to  this  theatre  last  night.  From  8</span><span>  o'clock  yesterday  morning  people  began  to  gather  at  the</span><span>  Ampitheatre  door  to  secure  admission  to  the  seats  in  that</span><span>  part  of  the  house.  All  day  long  the  crowd  grew  rapidly.</span><span>  At  noon  there  were  200  present.  As  the  afternoon  passed  the</span><span>  traffic  was  seriously  impeded  by  the  -waiting  hundreds.  But</span><span>  at  3  o'clock  the  management  opened  the  doors  and  allowed</span><span>  the  people  to  take  a  welcome  rest  inside.  At  5  o'clock</span><span>  there  came  a  message  from  Melba,  who  had  seen  thn  throng</span><span>  patiently  waiting,  that  all  there  present  were  to  have  tea</span><span>  with  her  at  her  expense,  and  they  did,  the  diva  playing</span><span>  hostess.  Then  the  early  ones  unanimously  decided  that  they</span><span>  had  been  repaid  for  their  weary  wait.  Besides  a  Piano  was</span><span>  sent  up  to  the  gallery  by  Mr.  Hugh  Ward,  and  there  was</span><span>  plenty  of  popular  music  to  while  away  the  time.  Whenthe</span><span>  orchestra  began>  there  was  no  room  at  all  in  the  whole</span><span>  house  for  anything  more  substantial  than  a  thought.  There</span></p> <p><span>  was  not  even  standing'  room  to  b©  bought.  The  appearance</span><span>  of  tile  conductor  ofthe  orchestra  was  the  signal  for  loud</span><span>  and  .enthusiastic  applause  from  the  ""waiting  galleryltesV'  Alf</span><span>  exchange  of  flowers  between  the  gallery  and'  the  managerial</span><span>  box  by  means  of  a  string  prbved^  a  relief  ;^to  the</span><span>  long  wait  of  the  peopl-e  upstaiVs-.  ""''''''Then'  ""'the  curtain  roife,</span><span>  -and  amidst  a  great  hush  the  -  overture  began.  Kveiybo>ay</span><span>  applauded  at  its  conclusion.  There  was  enthusiasm  of  the</span><span>  demonstrative  order  as  the  curtain  rose  upon  the  firet  scene,</span><span>  the.""  rooms  of  Violetta,  of  the  delicate  reputation.  Here</span><span>  entered  Melba,  and  the  house  rose  and  cheered  and  cheered</span><span>  agaiij.  It  was  glad  to  see  her.  Some  of  it  had  been  to  tea</span><span>  with  her,  and  was  obstrusively-  proud  of  the  fact.  But</span><span>  everyone  was*  glad.  Bo  was  Melba.  It  was  a  little  while</span><span>  before  she  could  go  on,  but  when  she  started,  well,  after</span><span>  that,  it;  was  just  Melba.  And  it  was  great,  right  along,</span><span>  right  to  the  end.  Everybody  who  had  tears  to  spare  shed</span><span>  them  when  she  was  dead,  and  of  90  per  cent  of  feminity  in</span><span>  the  gallery,  not  to  speak  of  the  other  parts  of  the  house,</span><span>  it  'is  safe  to  say  that  85  per  cent,  would^uheerfully  htive</span><span>  l:eSn  really  d!:ad  in  .such'  attractive*  surroundings,  «Lnd'  after</span><span>  ,  such  a.  triumph  as-  ths  diva  achieved  before  her.  demise.  The</span></p> <p><span>  curtain  fell  on  a  glorious  quartette,  M^lba;  Miss  Williams^</span><span>  Bcandiani,  and  TCauffman,  covering  the  death  scene  of  the</span><span>  heroine.  It  was  thrilling,  superb,  but  none  the  less^it^wus</span><span>  the  wonderful  acting  of  the  diva  herself,  who  died-painful|y</span><span>  in  such,  song  as  would  make  death  pleasant  any,  timev,aiid</span><span>  immediately  became  alive  again  to  skip  girl  like  about  the</span><span>  stage  and  help  pile  up  the  huge  mass  of  flowers  that  we're</span><span>  heaped  pn  it.

"<p><span>  Cigarettes</span></p> <p><span>  The  death  of  the  late  Mr.  Chas.  Baldwin  leaves  a  gap</span><span>  amongst  the  ol'd  identities  of  Brisbane,  now,  alas  !  i  fast</span><span>  passing  away.  His  funeral  was  well  attended,  and  sym</span><span>  pathy  goes  out  to  his  son,  Maurie  (one  of  the  best  of</span><span>  sports)  and  the  family,  generally.</span></p> <p><span>  All  things  considered  the  Rockham.pton  Carnival  was  an</span><span>  unqualified  success,  albeit  the  journey  by  train  is  most</span></p> <p><span>  tedious.</span></p> <p><span>  This  is  .  owing  to  the  primitive  arrangements  of  .the  rail</span><span>  way  authorities.  Not  a  few  who  travelled  in  the  ""Mail""</span><span>  on  Thursday  night  were  obliged  to  sit  up  ail  night  long,</span><span>  no  sleeping;  berths  being  available.</span></p> <p><span>  Once  in  ""Rocky""  a  regular  stampede  occurs  at  the  rail</span><span>  way  stations,  and  the  familiar  cry  of  ""Cab,  sir'!  Cab,</span><span>  sir  !  ""  ipached  the  iear.  The  cabby's  paradise  is  Rockhamp</span><span>  toni  at  Carnival  time.</span></p> <p><span>  Accommodation  is  a  discount  and  first  one  and  then  the</span><span>  other  hot(el  is  full.  ""Just  filled  up,""  says  the  proprietor.</span><span>  .'Try  further  up  the  road,""  and  away  goes  the  cabby  with</span><span>  his  fares  looking  for  a  chance  hotel.</span></p> <p><span>  Two  old  gents  who  ordered  a  cab  when  they  alighted</span><span>  out  of  the  train  at  six  o'clock  were  still  being  hawked</span><span>  about  the  town  until  eight  p.m.,  looking  for  lodgings.  How</span><span>  they  finished  the  cabby  alone  could  tell.</span></p> <p><span>  At  the  opening  ceremony-the  Races-an  enormous  at</span><span>  tendance  was  recorded,  the  course,  a  picturesque  one  situ-,</span><span>  ated  on  the  banks  of  the  river,  being  favourably  commented</span></p> <p><span>  upon.</span></p> <p><span>  Everything  was  up.  to  date  at  the  Races,  and  the  clock</span><span>  work  precision  of  the  stewards  and  starter  was  an  eye</span><span>  opener.  The  Brisbane  racing  officials  would  do  well  to</span><span>  journey  to  Rockhampton  and  receive  an  object  lesson.</span></p> <p><span>  The  veteran  secretary,  Mr.  Pawbarn,  had  an  extensive</span><span>  job  on  hand,  but  that  gentleman  fairly  excelled  himself.</span><span>  The  success  of  the  Rockhampton  Jockey  Club  owes  much  to</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Dawbarn.</span></p> <p><span>  Amonsrst  other  attractions  at  the  Carnival  was  Arthur</span><span>  Fostle,  the  famous  sprinter,  who  has  just  returned'  from</span><span>  England  and  Africa.  Postle  was  defeated  by  a  New  Zea</span><span>  lander  named  Trembath  before  a  vast  assemblage  of  neople.</span></p> <p><span>  Night  attractions  were  numerous,  the  pictures,  the  cir</span><span>  cus,  the  tlneatre,  the  sword  swallower,  the  snake  eating</span><span>  -  man.  This  individual  bites  the  heads  off  live  snakes  and</span></p> <p><span>  fairly  revelsi  in  the  business.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  party  gives  you  a  chance  to  see  him  bitten</span><span>  from  head  to  foot  by  venomous  snakes.  His  modus  oper</span><span>  andi  is  to  tal:e  poison  which  counteracts  the  snake  bite.</span><span>  This  man  is  a  perfect  marvel.</span></p> <p><span>  Ihe  show  grounds  were  densely  crowded.

Th,e</span><span>  ducks  here  were  as  thick  as  bees.</span></p> <p><span>  Others  went  out  by  rail  to  Yeppoon  and  Emu  Park,  two</span><span>  noted  seaside  resorts.  Both  are  beautifully  situated  anjd  the</span><span>  bathing  is  simply  par  excellence,  and  the  fishing  just  the</span><span>  thing.</span></p> <p><span>  No  betting  shops  were  visible  in  Rockhampton,  the  pro</span><span>  prietors  having  shut  up  owing  to  the  raid  in  Brisbane.  No</span><span>  gambling  in  any  shape  or  form  was  observed  in  the  town.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  given  out  that  the  Home  Secretary  intends  to  put</span><span>  the  new  Police  Offences  Bill  on  the  table  when  the  House</span><span>  mieets.  Ihis  will  have  the  effect  of  clearing  J3ris</span><span>  of  the  hundred  and  one  undesirables  .who  have</span><span>  had  a  real  good  innings.  :</span></p> <p><span>  i>uring  the  week  many  schnapper  parties  put  in  a  good</span><span>  time  on  the  lish&ng-  grounds.

The</span><span>  programme  that  is  served  up  is'  [attracting  crowds  of  affluent</span><span>  people  in  the  evening  dress  of  immaculate  respectability.</span><span>  This  is  no  doubt  due  to  the  quality  of  items  on  the  pro</span><span>  gramme.  With  the  present  'importations,  mediocrities  are!</span><span>  crowded  out  of  vaudeville,  and  only  those  who  can  get  it</span><span>  across  the  footlights  in  an  artistic  manner  can  possibly</span><span>  survive.:  :</span></p> <p><span>  Sandow,  the  sensational  pony,  which  will  be  one  of  the</span><span>  strongest  attractions;-at  the  Theatre  Boyal  on  Saturday,</span><span>  was  bred  and  educated  by  his  owner,  Mr.  Ernie  O'Neil.</span><span>  Sandow  is  a  dark  chestnut  without  a  spot  of  white  about</span><span>  him.  H$  is  seven  years  old  and1  only  eleven  hands  high.</span><span>  One  day  iii  Sydney  some  one  left  the  door  of  his  stable</span><span>  open,  and  Sandow  walked  out  to  Mr.  O'Neil's  residence,</span><span>  and  made.his  presence  known  by  knocking  at  the  front  door</span><span>  with  his  feet.  The  servant  on  going  to  the  door  was  aston</span><span>  ished  to  see  a  pony  walk  into  the  hall  and  remain  there,</span><span>  despite  the  efforts  to  remove  him  till  Mr.  O'Neil's  arrival</span></p> <p><span>  some  time  later.</span></p> <p><span>  Unlike  most  animals,  Sandow,  who  opens  at  the  Theatre</span><span>  Royal  on  Saturday,  has  no  vices,  and  shows  great  partial</span><span>  ity  for  women  and  children.  When  ridden  by  a  lady  or  ch'ilil</span><span>  Sandow  'is  as  docile  as  a  dog,  and  no  matter  what  his</span><span>  owner  (Mr.  O'Neil)  does,  he  cannot  make  him  go  through</span><span>  his  buck  jumping  exhibition  ;  but  should  a  grown-up  mem</span><span>  ber  of  the  sterner  sex  get  astride  of  him,  at  a  word  from</span><span>  Mr.  O'Neil  he  will  go  through  such  a  number  of  pranks</span><span>  that  the  rider  is  pleased  to  dismount.  Sandow-s  imitation</span><span>  of  a  drunken  man  coming  home  from  his  club  is  said  to  be</span><span>  irresistibly  funny.</span></p> <p><span>  A  sporting  offer  was  made  the  other  d'ay  by  a  well</span><span>  known  racing  man  to  Mr.  Ernest  O'Neil  for  the  purchase  of</span><span>  his  pony  Sandow.  It  consisted  of  an,  offer  of  the  weight  of</span><span>  Sandow  in  silver  in  exchange  for  the  ownership  of  him.</span><span>  Mr.  O'Neil  laughingly  replied.  ""Even  if  I  did  want  to  part</span><span>  with  hiih  his  weight  in  gold  would  not  tempt  me.""</span></p> <p><span>  Miss  Bertha  Ballinger,  who  has  been  the  guest  of  Mrs.</span><span>  Clifton,  ""The  Nook,""  was  hostess  at  a  charming  little  after  ?</span><span>  noon  tea  at  Eschenhagen's  on  Tuesday  last.

One  good  sister  claims  that  she  had  Divine</span><span>  advice  about  the  Richmond  railway  accident  a  week  before</span><span>  it  happened,  but  didn't  wain  the  passengers  because  she  &lt;con</span><span>  &lt;  stirued'  the  information  as  being  given  not  that  she  might</span></p> <p><span>  do  a  :deed  of  mercy,  but  that  she  might  see  tihe  tragedy</span><span>  enacted  just  to  strengthen  her  own  faith.  There  is  nothing</span><span>  more  sublime  than  the  egotism  of  a  freak  religionist.</span></p> <p><span>  Will  Sullivan,  now  at  the  Theatre  Royal,  plays  a  sketch</span><span>  entitled  the  ""Indian's  Bride.':  In  this  sketch  a  supernusmary'</span><span>  is  called  upon  to  say  the  following  words,  ""Buffalo;  Bill  is</span><span>  not  hiding  here;  in  fact  I  do  not  know  him.""  This  super</span><span>  numary  is  usually  rehearsed  by  the  resident  stage  manager.</span><span>  On  Will  Sullivan's  opening  at  Glasgow  he  did  not  meet  th®</span><span>  supernumary  until  the  middle  of  the  sketch,  when  he  was</span><span>  paralysed  to  hear  him,  made  up  as  an  Indian,  say  the</span><span>  words,  ""BufYalor  Buirll  lis  noo  heedin'  lieere,  and  1  \y\wl  hao</span><span>  ye  ken  I  dinna  ken  the  mon,""  /'????</span></p> <p><span>  It  was  during''  the  show  week  that  Ernest  Pitcher  qf  the1</span><span>  Theatre  Lioyal  .had1  the  wildest  afternoon  of  his  Brisbane</span><span>  career.  He  met  a  stranger  with  whom  he  got  into  conver</span><span>  sation.  Cards  were  I  exchanged,  when  the  stranger  asked  Pit</span><span>  cher  was  he  related'  to  Pitcher  of  the  ""Pink  'Un.""  In  a</span><span>  weak  moment  the  big  comedienne  .said  ''.'Yes.""  It.  appeared</span><span>  that  the  stranger  was  a  great  friend  of  the  ""(Pink  'Un""</span><span>  writer,  and  in  living  up  to  the  lie  the  Australian  comedian</span><span>  had  to  stand  drink  for.  drink  till  the  buildings  began  to  go</span><span>  round.  The  only  pleasant  moment  of  the  interview  for  E.I?.</span><span>  was  when  the  stranger  staggered  to  the  corner  of  the  club</span><span>  and  curled  himself  up  in  profound  sleep.</span></p> <p><span>  Miss  Vagge,  of  the  Vagges,  started  her  career  of  ball</span><span>  punching  in  a  very  novel  manner.  During  a  tour  of  her</span><span>  parents  throughout  Europe,  Miss  Vagge  was  placed  in  a</span><span>  ladies'  seminary  till  their  return.  She  grieved  considerably</span><span>  on  being  placed  among  strangers,  and  threatened  to  fall</span><span>  into  a  decline.  A  cable  was  sent  to  her  parents,  saying  she</span><span>  was  ailing*  and  the  reply  came,  ""Cheer  her  up  ;  make  a</span><span>  man  of  her.""  This  so  tickled  the  lady  principal  of  t&lt;he  col</span><span>  lege  that  ,she  showed  the  message  to  the  gymnastic  instruc</span><span>  tor,  who  entered  into  the  spirit  of  the  thing,  and  fitted  up  a.</span><span>  ball  and  board,  taught  her  how  to  punch  the  ball.  TS&e</span><span>  novelty  of  it  appeal  led  to  Miss  Vagge,  and  she  became  quite</span><span>  an  adept  at  the  exercise,  which  by  the  way  is  more  stren</span><span>  uous  than  it  appears  to  be.  There  was  no  one  more  amused</span><span>  at  the  episode  than  her  father  when  lie  returned  to  claim</span><span>  his  daughter.</span></p> <p><span>  TOOWOOMBA.-Mrs.  and  Miss,  Campbell  Iiiley  entertained</span><span>  numbel*  of  guests  at  a  delightful  river  picnic  during  their</span><span>  recent  visit  to  Brisbane.

Tea  took  place  at  6.30  at  which  Mrs.</span><span>  Garland  was  hostess.  At  8  o'clock  the  meeting  was  held.</span><span>  Miss  Whittaker,  who  was  introduced  by  Mrs.  Weedon,  gave  a;</span><span>  very  intei,estirg  address,  and  offered  to  answer  any  ques</span><span>  tions  as  to  the  aims  and  objects  of  the  G.F.S.

Villa,</span></p> <p><span>  West  End.</span></p> <p><span>  The  New  South  Wales  Parliament  opened  lately</span><span>  and  the  social  lights  of  polities'  occupied  the  front</span><span>  benches  and  appeared  in  no  wise  cast  down,  though..  there</span><span>  was  such  a  flattened  out  feeling  about  the  whole  proceeding#</span><span>  that  it  even  effected  the  picturesque  Sir.  Francis  Suttor,  in</span><span>  his  .court  >suit  and  lace  ruffles,  and  he  beamed  less  urbanely</span><span>  than  is  his  wont.  The  Lieutenant  Governor,  Sir  William</span><span>  Cullen,  had  not  thought  lit  to  'be  present,  and  had  sent  his</span><span>  commissioners  to  perform  the  opening,  which  they  did  in</span><span>  the  quickest  time  on  record.  The  only  thrill  that  passed</span><span>  through  the  gathering  was  felt  when  the  members  of  the</span><span>  Government  party  marched  in  headed  by  the  newly-elected</span><span>  Speaker.  Everyone  was  agog  to  see  what  manner  of  man</span><span>  was  Mr.  Willis,  and  how  he  looked  after  the  stormy  scenes</span><span>  he  had  occasioned.  In  his  roiTes  of  office  this  man  of  mark</span><span>  seemed  as  if  he  had  occupied  the  chair  all  the  days  of  bis</span><span>  life.  He  must  be  a  man  of  iron  nerve,  for  all  the  insult</span><span>  and  vituperation  that  had  been  heaped  upon  him  left  him</span><span>  quite  unperturbed.  On  the  afternoon  that  the  Irving  Co.  left,</span><span>  several  of  its  most  important  members  farewelled  at  the</span><span>  Australia.  Miss  Dorothea  Baird  came  floating  in  in  a  busi</span><span>  ness-like  travelling  coat  and  a  flat  ""English'''  sort  of  hat</span><span>  tied  under  the  chin  with  a  gossamer,  and  her  sister,  'Mrs.</span><span>  B.  R.  Wise,  accompanied  her.  The  resemblance  between</span><span>  these  two  sisters  is  striking,  except  that.Mrs.  Wise  is  much</span><span>  more  reposeful  than  the  ever-restful  actress.  The  chicness</span><span>  of  the  party  was  well  supplied  by  the  audaciously  pretty</span><span>  second  leading  lady,  MiSs  Irene  Brown,  whose  red-gold  curls</span><span>  peeped  out  from  under  a  cute  little  brown  basin  of  a  hat.</span><span>  The  little  beauty  sat  munching  chocolates  from  a  huge  box</span><span>  cfuite  in-different,  but  not  unconscious  of  the  fact,  that  an</span><span>  artist  in  a  secluded  corner  was  sketching  those  pouting  lips</span><span>  closing  over  a  particularly  seductive  nougat.  Miss  Brown</span><span>  has  been  most  assiduous  in  her  attendance  at  the  tea  tables</span><span>  in  the  winter  garden}  while  thercomipany  was  in  Sydney,  anil</span><span>  the  flutter  of  her  fascinating  green  scarf  will  be  missed  by</span><span>  accustomed  eyes.  Mir.  \W.  M.  Hughes  and  his  bride  paid  a</span><span>  visit  to  Sydney  this  week,  and  immediately  upon  arrival</span><span>  hied  to  the  fastnesses  of  Gore  Hill,  where  the  Federal</span><span>  Attorney-General's  S.ydney  home,  ""Osborne  Park,""  is  sit</span><span>  uate.  This  flight  to  inaccessible  partus  vastly  chagrined  the</span><span>  interviewing  person  who  never  catches  a  glimpse  of  a  pol</span><span>  itician  without  wanting  to  know  what  the  statesman  thinksi</span><span>  of  some  situation  or  other.  On  these  occasions  &lt;fche  tren</span><span>  chant  W.M.  is  apt  to  say  what  he  thinks  of  the  pressman,</span><span>  '  so  pe#aps  the  flight  to;tl;e  ancestral  halls  was.  a  blessing</span></p> <p><span>  ""  in  disguise,  especially  as  the  A.G.  is  suffering  from  nerves.</span></p> <p><span>  However,  Mrs.  Hughes,  who  was  one  of  our  own  nice  girls,</span><span>  was  able  to  air  soinp  her  trousseau  gowns  in  public  after</span><span>  all,  for  the  rest  and/seclusion  so  soon  restored  the  frayed</span><span>  out  nerves!  of  her  husband,  that  on  Prince  of  Wales  birthday</span><span>  he  rushed  into  the  fray  at  a  political  conference  that  was</span><span>  being*  held  at  the  Trades  Hall,  and  the  dutiful  wife  attended</span><span>  several  of  the  sittings.  But  I  don't  think  Mrs.  Hughes  is</span><span>  yet  sufficiently  pachydermatous  to  thoroughly  enjoy  her</span><span>  trenchant  partner's  trouncing  of  his  opponents,  for  she  wore</span><span>  a  worried  air  while  little  pieasa^ries  were  being  exchanged}</span></p> <p><span>  between  her  man  and  some  of  the  State  Minister.</span><span>  One  of  our  gird  artists,  Evelyn  Chapman,  has  been</span><span>  threatening  to  set  the  harbour  on  fire  for  the  past  couple</span><span>  of  years,  and  the  work  sihe  now7  shows  is  startlingly  clever</span><span>  for  a  girl  just  out  of  her  teens;  She  hists  a  full-length  por</span><span>  trait  of  her  father  on  the  walls;  which  is  a  strong  piece  of</span><span>  work  anid  handled  interestingly.  That  it  is  also  an  excel</span><span>  lent  likeness  we  had  ample  opportunity  of  judging,  for  the</span><span>  proud  father  presented  himself  at  the  private  view,  and</span><span>  gravitated  towards  his  daughter's  masterpiece  as  naturally</span><span>  as  the  needle  to  the  Pole,  and  everyone  said,  ""That's  the</span><span>  man.""
