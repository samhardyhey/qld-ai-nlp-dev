I  did  pass  uiUKtor,  and  had</span><span>  un  enjoyable  time  with  Evelyn  who</span><span>  was  a  groat  fuVourite  in  the  district).  I</span><span>  was  taken  everywhere,  but  a  party  I</span><span>  wont  to  one  uight,  tho  subject  of  this</span><span>  littlo  story,  I  shall  nnver  forget  as  long</span><span>  as  I  live.  Tbe  evening  bad  been  nn</span><span>  enjoyable  one.  and  whim  it  came  to  a</span><span>  close  about  11,15,  .wo  had  tho  offor  of</span><span>  a  lift  homo  in  a  buggy  or  walk  We</span><span>  both  decided  to  walk  as  we  had  not</span><span>  then  beon  long  odgagnd  ;  so  wo  star</span><span>  ted  off  for  borne,  and  decided  to  take  a</span><span>  short  cut  through  the  church  yard.</span><span>  Nearing  there  the  rain  camn  down  in</span><span>  torrents.  The  soil  hero  was  very</span><span>  sticky,  mostly  c'ny.  We  got  into  the</span><span>  yard  and  bnr.h  catno  down,  Eyolyn  los</span><span>  ing  a  shoe.  However  we  managed  to  get</span><span>  on  to  somebody's  tombstone  and  there</span><span>  wo  sat.  I  tried  to  place  the  church</span><span>  porch,  but  everything  was  as  dark  as</span><span>  pitch.  The  place  seemed  haunted</span><span>  with  souls—  ghosts  you  call  them,  pur-</span><span>  haps  so—  for  dark  uh  the  night  was:</span><span>  these  ghoats  appeared  boforo  you  like</span><span>  phosphorous,  and  thoy  reminded  me</span><span>  of  the  following  :  Some  of  the  ghosts</span><span>  wore  short,  some-  of  tho  ghosts  were</span><span>  tall,  aud  they  all  o  it  up  in  a  ghostly</span><span>  row,  on.  tbo  top  of  the  church  yard</span><span>  wall.'  .  Evelyn  started  to  pray,  which</span><span>  brought  me  back  to  my  ohildhood</span><span>  days,  and  I  caught  her  still  tighter  in</span><span>  my  arms,  and  was  kissing  hor  fondly,</span><span>  when  suddonly  I  felt  a  tap  oa  my</span><span>  shoulder  ;  a  roal  live  ghost  thiR  time,</span><span>  for  it  was  tho  village  conotublo  on  bis</span><span>  night  boat  doing  his  round.  I  told</span><span>  him  what  bad  happened,  but  my  ex</span><span>  cuse  was  fteble,  us.  I  was  only,  a</span><span>  struugor  iu  the-,  district.  However,</span><span>  tho  constable  was  known  bo  Evelyn,</span><span>  and  when  she  became  morn  oomposud</span><span>  she  told  Harvey  my  story  was  correct,</span><span>  and  he  at  onco  recognised  my  lover's</span><span>  voioe,  Baying,  'Obit's  you,  Miss  Thuui-</span><span>  ger.'  With  full  apology  ho  hastened</span><span>  off  to  awake  up  old  Towns,  the  village</span><span>  oabby,  who  havtouod  to  tho  sonho  and</span><span>  drove  us  closo  homo,  I  thought  it</span><span>  wise  not  to  drive  to  the  door,  forjeur</span><span>  of-  waking  up  the  household,  as  it  was</span><span>  now  3  a.  m,  so  I  carried  Evelyn  the</span><span>  -last  hundred  yards  in  my  arms.  We</span><span>  arrived  oold,  wot  and  tired.  Wo  de</span><span>  cided  before  retiring  tiot  to  tell  our</span><span>  experiences  on  the  following  day  ;  so</span><span>  I  tipped  the  servants  well  to  clean  our</span><span>  clothes.  Tho  village  couBtuble  and</span><span>  the  oabby,  Towns,  were  not  forgotten,</span><span>  so  no  one  was  nuy  the  wiser:  Had</span><span>  they  boon  I  might  never  have  gob  the</span><span>  chance  to  got  Evelyn  to  change  her</span><span>  maiden  name  to  mine.</span></p> ",Article,1920-11-05,"Begged In a Cemetery.

Extra  Division.</span><span>  Or  Bruxner  brhught  up  theimatter  \  '</span><span>  of  the  re-distribution  of  the-  divisions</span><span>  of  the  Shire,  He  said  that  at  the</span><span>  tiine  the'tramway  benefited  area  was</span><span>  adopted  Darlington  ratepayers  were</span><span>  inoluded,  but  many  maintain  that  they</span><span>  should  not  have  been.  The  position  ""</span><span>  new  was  that  half  No  1  division  was</span><span>  in  the  benefited  area  and  half  was  out</span><span>  of  it.  It  would  be  muoh  better  if  all  -</span><span>  tho  benefited  area  was  in  one  division,</span><span>  because  at  present  it  was  a  difficult</span><span>  matter  to'  fix  a  proper  rate.  On  ac</span><span>  count  of  the  tramway  rate  tbe  general</span></p> <p><span>  rate  was  kept  low  ;  too  consequence</span><span>  was  that  as  far  as  the  Kerry  side  was</span><span>  concerned  there  -waa  not  snffioienb</span><span>  money  raised  to  keep  tbe  roads  in  a</span><span>  proper  state  of  repair.  It  was  aruged</span><span>  that  because  they  had  the  tramway  on  :  -  ;S</span><span>  the  Lamiqgtoq  side  there  was  no  qo-</span><span>  cessity  to  have'  good  roads,  because</span><span>  they  robbed  tbe  tramway.  If  some--</span><span>  thing  was  not  done  they  would  go  on</span><span>  having  bad  '  roads  beonuso  of  tbe  way  .  ..</span><span>  the  benefited  area  was  arranged.  16</span><span>  would  be  the  fairest  way  to  have  tho  -</span><span>  benefited  area  all  in  one  division,  then  .</span><span>  the  other  division,  could  go  on  and</span><span>  make  good  roads.  They  oould  have</span><span>  the  benefited  as  an  extra  division,  thus</span><span>  making  four  divisions.</span><span>  Cr  Plunkett  said  that  when  tho</span><span>  tramway  area  was  paying  a  big  rate  ,</span><span>  the  general  rate  was  kept  low,  this</span><span>  was  holding  baok  the-  general  road</span><span>  work  in  the  other  divisions.  He  -</span><span>  was  favourable  '  to  -having  an  extra  .</span><span>  division,  or  having  the  benefited  area</span><span>  divided  into  two  divisions,  bat  the</span><span>  question  arose,  ""Oould  they  both  hava  -</span><span>  three  representatives  ?  He  found  it</span><span>  hard  to  arrange  about  the  rating  in</span><span>  his  division.  ....</span><span>  Or  Bruxner  said  they  would  get</span><span>  better  results  if  they  bad  extra  divi</span><span>  siou  undor  the  benefited  area.  As  re</span><span>  gards  the  rating  it  was  diffioult  to  ar</span><span>  range  at  present  -becanso  land  on  the  -</span><span>  tramway  was  valued  higher  than  land</span><span>  outside  the  area,  notwithstanding  that  -</span><span>  in  both  oases  the  land  was  of  equal  -  -  ...</span><span>  value.  If  the  suggestion  was  adopted  -  .</span><span>  the  argaement  .  about  the  Lara  road</span><span>  wonld  be  overcame,  -He  was  prepared  .</span><span>  to  admit  tbat  No.,2  division  should  pay</span><span>  something  for  the  upkeep  of  the  Lsra</span><span>  road,  beoaase  they  used  it  just  as  --</span><span>  muoh  as  No  1  ratepayers.</span><span>  .The  Ohairman  suggested  that  .  a</span><span>  sub-committee  should  bs  appointed</span><span>  to  go  into  .tho  matter,  because  they</span><span>  might  go  on  discussing  without  com-  _</span><span>  ing  to  any  decision  -  '  .  :  .</span><span>  Or  Kittle  proposed  that  tho  Ohair-</span><span>  inan  and  Ors  Bruxner,  Plunkett,  and</span><span>  Dryuah.bo  appointed  a  sub-committee  -</span><span>  to  draw  up  a  report  on  the  matter,  <</span><span>  Seconded  by  Or  Oahill  und  oarried.

The  ool-</span><span>  leotions  were  certainly  taken,  and  the</span><span>  Musical  Union  cbequereeeived  through</span><span>  the  hon.  sec  ,  I  think  Mjss  Norman  ;</span><span>  ohequo  was  signed  by  Mr-O,  Roden</span><span>  (Q.M.E),  perhaps  a  private  one  for</span><span>  convenience.

Some  of  the  farms,</span><span>  especially  in  tbe  neighbourhood  of  Mt</span><span>  Barney,  were  in  a  very  distressing</span><span>  condition,  cattle  having  to  be  driven</span><span>  four  miles  eaob  way  to  water,  whioh</span><span>  -was  then  not  fit  for  anniinal  consump</span><span>  tion,  in.  some  oases  the  water  obtained</span><span>  in  the  wells  wasso.salino  that  animals</span><span>  refused  to  drink  ib.

A  great'  source  of  trouble  ex-'</span><span>  perienced  throughout  the  whole  of  the</span><span>  distriot  -is  the-  honey  combing  of  the</span><span>  gronnd  with  salt  or  brackish  water  ;</span><span>  in  my  search  for  fresb  water  I  invari-</span><span>  bly  endeavoured  to  get  as  far  away</span><span>  as  possible  from  these  Baline  sources,</span><span>  bat  if  tbe  ground  was  at  ail  permeable</span><span>  when  wells  were  sunk  ,  on  the  fresh</span><span>  streams,  salt  or  brakish  water  fre</span><span>  quently  soaked  iD,  bnt  more  generally</span><span>  it  is  the  case  that  the  wells!  have  been</span><span>  sank  on  the  salt  water  through  deficient</span><span>  knowlcdgo  ;  for  domostio  purposes  this</span><span>  is  highly  objeotiooablq.  bnt  as  a  stook</span><span>  water  it  possesses  some  advantages,  if</span><span>  soffioiently  dilated.</span><span>  A  very  striking  instance  of  the  use</span><span>  of  the  divining  rod,  when  properly  un</span><span>  derstood,  may  be  -found  on  tbe  farms</span><span>  of.Mr.  F  Smith  and  Mr.  -W  Johnson,</span><span>  at.
