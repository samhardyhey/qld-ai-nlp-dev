We  find  David</span><span>  gave  all  his  credit  and  success  to  God.</span><span>  God  was  the  key  and  centre  theme  of</span><span>  his  life.

He  said</span><span>  that  the  Beaudesert  ladies  went  to  a</span><span>  tremendous  amount  of  trouble  each</span><span>  Anzac  Day  to  provide  a  dinner.

Hopkins  said  that  the  C.W.A.  not</span><span>  only  came  forward  on  Anzac  Day  but</span><span>  the  members  were  to  the  fore  to  patrio</span><span>  tic  efforts.

He  was  sorry  Clr.</span><span>  Hopkins  could  not  carry  on  the  chair</span><span>  manship  a  little  longer.  In  27  years  Clr.</span><span>  Hopkins  had  contested  one  election,</span><span>  being  returned  unopposed  nine  times.</span><span>  That  conveyed  to  the  speaker  that  Clr.</span><span>  Hopkins  had  given  satisfaction  to  the</span><span>  district.</span><span>  Mr.  Muller  welcomed  returned  men</span></p> <p><span>  DaCK  no  civil  me,  luiu  aaiu  uiie  peuyin</span><span>  would  remember  their  action  when</span><span>  things  looked  blackest.</span><span>  Mr,  Muller  said  that  he  could  not</span><span>  see  the  new  order  that  had  been  spoken</span><span>  of  during  the  war.  The  only  new  order</span><span>  was  when  they  found  some  men  did  not</span><span>  want  work,  and  they  were  not  returned</span></p> <p><span>  men.

He</span><span>  hoped  that  to  the  next  few  years  that</span><span>  the  people  would  drop  some  of  the  sel</span><span>  fish  spirit  so  pronounced  to  the  past.</span><span>  Clr.  Sharpe  (Chairman  of  the  -Tam</span><span>  borine  Shire  Council)  returned</span><span>  thanks  for  honouring  the  returned</span><span>  men.

He</span><span>  read  with  interest  the  fact  that  Beau</span><span>  desert  had  an  active  sub-branch.  He</span><span>  advised  all  returned  men  to  Join</span><span>  their  sub-branch,  and  so  be  in  a</span><span>  position  to  be  able  to  assist  those</span><span>  not  so  fortunate  as  themselves.</span><span>  Mr.  L.

He  congratulated  them  on</span><span>  the  job  done,  and  said  he  hoped  the</span><span>  band  would  be  with  them  for  many</span><span>  years  to  come.  ""Colonel  Bogey""  was  a</span><span>  great  old  tune,  and  they  enjoyed</span><span>  marching  to  it.</span><span>  Mr.  Stephens  also  said  it  was  a  won</span><span>  derful  thing  for  people  to  organise</span><span>  Anzac  Day  celebrations.

The  sohoolboy  match  '</span><span>  1  provided  a  runaway  game  for  the  visitors.</span></p> <p><span>  i  On  the  day  Beaudesert-  would  have</span><span>  !  held  its  own  with  many  teams,  and</span><span>  i  the  game  served  to  show  that  the  ma-</span><span>  '  terial  is  available.

The  team  that  played</span><span>  i  on  Sunday  is  always  subject  to  altera-</span><span>  tion,  but  it  is  safe  to  say  that  it  will</span><span>  i  take  reversals  of  form  on  the'  part  of</span><span>  1  representative  players,  and  good  dis-</span><span>  |  plays  by  others  not  in  the  side,  to  bring</span><span>  about  alterations  prior  to  the  next</span><span>  match.</span><span>  Consequently  money  should  be  spent</span><span>  in  developing  the  team.  If  it  is""  at  all</span><span>  '  possible  the  players  should  be  brought</span><span>  I  to  Beaudesert  for  training  under  the</span><span>  I  electric  light,  and  the  services  of  a</span><span>  |  coach  should  be  engaged  for  those</span><span>  |  training  periods  if  this  Can  be  done.</span><span>  The  Beaudesert  team  is  not  perfect,</span><span>  j  because  no  team  can  ever  expect  to</span><span>  reach  that  stage,  but  it  can  develop</span><span>  greater  understanding  that  will  help  no</span><span>  end.</span><span>  Understanding  between  players  means</span><span>  that  the  man  with  the  ball  anticipates</span><span>  ;  that  there  is  somebody  with  him  all  the</span><span>  time,  and,  consequently,  he""  uncon-</span><span>  !  seiously  overcomes  any  desire  to  hang</span><span>  on  to  the  ball  and  go  on  his,  own,</span><span>  Backs  also  know  that  forwards  are</span><span>  trailing  them,  and'  it  gives  them  con-</span><span>  j  fiderice.

Beaudesert  won  but  18  ef-</span><span>  .  fective  scrums  to  30  in  favour  of  Wyn</span><span>  num,  the  half  time  position  being  13-7</span><span>  Wynnum's  way.</span><span>  'Greater  credit  is  due  to  Beaudesert</span><span>  for  overcoming  this  impost.  They  also</span><span>  Infringed  more,  having  10  Iree  kloks</span><span>  ,  against  them  in  the  first  half  with  six</span><span>  in  their  favour,  (file  second  half  tally</span><span>  was  4-2  against  them.</span><span>  On  the  day  it  would  be  difficult  tq</span><span>  displace  any  Beaudesert  player.  A  team</span><span>  with  such  a  margin  qf  superiority  can</span><span>  hot  but  shtao?  The  backs  were  grand</span><span>  ip  attack,  and  it  stands  to  reason  that</span><span>  the  defence  work  must  have  been  good</span><span>  to  stop  the  chances  that  Wynnum  had.</span><span>  The  pivot  mep  did  not  get  the</span><span>  amount  of  work  given  their  opposition,</span></p> <p><span>  jpit  when  they  did  secure  the  leather</span><span>  from  the  scrums  they  moved  fast,  with</span><span>  Plunkett  winning  applause  for  his  ef</span><span>  forts.  Wellington,  on  the  wing,  was</span><span>  outstanding.  He  did  not  wait  for  the</span><span>  ball,  his  ideas  of  the  work  of  the  win</span><span>  ger  being  such  that  he  went  looking  for</span><span>  opportunities,  or  chances  to  make  op</span><span>  portunities  for  himself.  He  certainly  got</span><span>  results.</span><span>  Anderson  gave  his  forwards  every  en</span><span>  couragement  by  setting  an  example</span><span>  that  they  followed.</span><span>  The  match  was  interesting  through</span><span>  out  all  stages  because  Wynnum,  with</span><span>  so  much  of  the  ball,-  was-  always  likely</span><span>  to  stage  an  attack.  Had  It  not  been</span><span>  for  the  spotting  of  the  forwards,  Kay</span><span>  would  have  given  more  trouble  than  he</span><span>  did.  He  was  a  very  tired  man  after  half</span><span>  time,  no  doubt  due  to  the  attention  he</span><span>  received  during  the  match,  following</span><span>  on  the  hard  game  of  Saturday,  At</span><span>  times  he  showed  the  football  that  has</span><span>  made  him  an  interstate,  and  potential</span><span>  international  player.</span><span>  The  game  was  refereed  by  R.  White,</span><span>  of  Brisbane.</span><span>  The  teams  were:</span><span>  Wynnum:  Full  back,  E.  Glass;  three-</span><span>  quarters,  M.  Ackworth,  D.  Pye,  F.</span><span>  Elms,  G.  Fuller;  five-eight,  T.  Baxter;</span></p> <p><span>  half  back,  J.  Thurlow;  forwards,  R.</span><span>  Ross,  P.  O'Connor,  Eckland,  N.</span><span>  Cloherty,  M.  Annan,  R,  Kay.</span><span>  Beaudesert:  Full  back,  S.  Callanan;</span><span>  three-quarters,  G.  Wellington,  K.</span><span>  Panitz,  P.  Deane,  K.  Morrissy;  five-</span><span>  eight,  T.  Plunkett;  half  back,  W,  Col</span><span>  lins;  forwards,  V.  McGovern,  D-  Cahill,</span><span>  R.  Dauth,  W.  Day,  R.  Smith,  D.  Ander</span><span>  son.</span><span>  A  scrum  at  half  way  started  play,</span><span>  A  minute  after  Dauth  attempted  a</span><span>  goal  from  five  yards  from  half  way.</span><span>  Another  free  kick  a  minute  and  a  half</span><span>  later,  and  Dauth.  made  no  mistake,</span><span>  giving  his  side  an  early  lead.'</span><span>  Beaudesert  set  up  an  offensive.  They</span><span>  kicked  through,  and  Wellington  fol</span><span>  lowed  on.  He  '  dribbled  the  '  ball,  and,</span><span>  when  it  was  over  the  line,  he  touched</span><span>  down.  It  was  a  clever  piece  of  work,</span><span>  Dauth  missed.</span><span>  Wynnum  won  a  scrum  near  half  way,</span><span>  but  lost  the  ball.  Wellington  secured</span><span>  and  he  raced  everything  for  the  corner.</span><span>  Dauth's  effort  was  particularly  good,</span><span>  and  after  4  minutes  Beaudesert  led  by</span><span>  ten  points.</span><span>  Exciting  football  followed.  From  the</span><span>  kick  off  Fuller  and  Baxter  handled,  but</span><span>  the  latter  was  forced  out.  Play  was  now</span><span>  in  the  Beaudesert  quarter,  arid  Kay</span><span>  went  close  to  the  chalk  line  before  be</span><span>  ing  forced  out.  Cahill  retired  with  a</span><span>  fractured  wrist  and  F.  Callanan  took</span><span>  his  place,</span><span>  Beaudesert  initiated  a  move  in  its</span><span>  own  quarter,  and  Morrissy  received  near</span><span>  half  way,  He  won  the  race  to  the  posts.</span><span>  Dauth  again  came  to  light  —  _</span><span>  '  Kay  made  a  dash,  gave  to  O'Gonnor,</span><span>  and  was  there  to  take  the  return.  He</span><span>  had  only  to  pass  S.  Callanan,  and  he</span><span>  was  at  hia  top.  Callanan  dived  at  the</span><span>  right  second,  and  grassed  his  big  op</span><span>  ponent,  saving  the  situation.  Dauth</span><span>  forced  his  way  through  the  resultant</span><span>  ruck,  but  soon  after  the  side  was  penal</span><span>  ised.  Glass  kicked  a  goal,  and  his  side</span><span>  was  13  points  in  arrears  after  174  min</span><span>  utes.</span><span>  Glass  attempted  a  goal  from  two</span><span>  yards  over  half  way.  Wynnum  dropped</span><span>  a  ball  at  its  own  quarter,  and  Welling</span><span>  ton  was  at  his  top  when  it  went  to</span><span>  him  near  halfway.  It  was  a  one  sided</span><span>  race  for  the  line.  Panitz  missed.</span></p> <p><span>  After  26  minutes  K,v.  kicked  from</span><span>  well  out,  to  get  a  nice  Knai,</span><span>  F.  Callanan  was  seen  in  some  heady</span><span>  work.  Up  to  this  st:n>e  Wynnum  had</span><span>  won  13  of  the  16  effective  scrums,  and</span><span>  Beaudesert  had  Ijeen  penalised  eight</span><span>  times  tq  four  ta  their  favour.</span><span>  Kay  jiicked  another  goal  and  Day</span><span>  went  over  from  a  move  started  at  Beau-</span><span>  desert's  quarter  by  S.  Callanan.  Cal</span><span>  lanan  had  cut  holes  in  the  opposition.</span><span>  Dauth  missed.  Kay  missed  a  long  kick</span><span>  at  goal,  F.  Callanan  followed  on  on</span><span>  his  own,  but  his  good  work  was  nulli</span><span>  fied  for  want  of  support.</span><span>  Wynnum's  fullback  was  seen  in  a</span><span>  -long  run  that  beat  tho  opposition,  and,</span><span>  Wheripre's'seScill:</span><span>  forced  out  by  Wellington.  It  was  a</span><span>  dangerous  position.  The  bell  went  a</span><span>  ininute  later.</span><span>  After  oranges  Beaudesert  attacked</span><span>  with  vigour,  and  had  play  centred  in</span><span>  the  opposition  quarter.  Wellington</span><span>  made  a  ""dribbling""  rush,  and  it  devel</span><span>  oped  into  a  race  between  Thurlow  and</span><span>  he  for  the  ball.  The  former  was  in  a</span><span>  handier  position,  and  he  just  got  there</span><span>  to  save.  After  englu  minutes  Dauth,</span><span>  who  had  done  so  well  with  liis  boot,</span><span>  missed  an  easy  one.  Soon  after  Thur</span><span>  low  was  taken  off  in  the  ambulance</span><span>  car.</span><span>  To  McGovern'went  the  honour  of  the</span><span>  opening  try  of  the  second  half.  He</span><span>  scored  from  a  ruck  for  Panitz  to  con</span><span>  vert.  Beaudesert  was  playing  part</span><span>  icularly  good  football,  and  Deane  gave</span><span>  ""Panitz  f.lie  chance  to  top  off  a  brilliant</span><span>  move.  S.  Callanan  failed,  and  the  score</span><span>  was  29—6  after  18  minutes  play.</span><span>  E.  Glass  went  close  to  beating  the</span><span>  opposition  when  he  came  from  well</span><span>  behind  to  out  holes  in  the  Beaudesrt</span><span>  side.  Panitz  delighted  the  crowd  when</span><span>  he  kicked  ahead,  raced  after  the  ball,</span><span>  and  scooped""  it  up  when  still  at  his  full.</span><span>  He  went  over  the  -line  mixed  up  with</span><span>  Kay,  but  lost  the  ball  before  he  could</span><span>  ground  it.  The  pick  up  was  the  type  of</span><span>  movement  that  will  always  be  appre</span><span>  ciated  by  the  crowd,</span><span>  Another  popular  movement  went</span><span>  wrong  through  a  fumble  of  an  easy</span><span>  take.  Anderson  was  hemmed  in,  and</span><span>  he  threw,  a  long  pass  to  Morrissy,  who</span></p> <p><span>  lost  it.  The  move  is  one  that  has  been</span><span>  exploited  to  the  full  by  international</span><span>  teams,  and  generally  gets  results.</span><span>  After  25  minutes  Wynnum  was  in</span><span>  no  end  of  trouble,  and  the  side  was</span><span>  lucky  to  keep  its  line  clear  as  long  as</span><span>  is  did.</span><span>  Panitz  was  forced  out  bv  a  tanklar</span></p> <p><span>  when  well  set  for  the  line.  From  the</span><span>  scramble  after  the  scrum  Dauth  gave</span><span>  to  Collins,  and  lie  sent  to  Plunkett,  who</span><span>  swung  in,  to  throw  the  opposition  off</span><span>  its  balance.  He  scored  a  nice  try.</span><span>  Morrissy  added  the  extras,</span><span>  Wynnum  came  to  light  with  a  splash</span><span>  of  snappy  passing  but  it  was  soon</span><span>  broken  up.  F.  Callanan  Initiated  a</span><span>  move  that  allowed  Plunkett  to  run</span><span>  Deane  into  position,  and  Deane  to</span><span>  score  under  the  uprights.  Day  caught</span><span>  the  lineumplres'  flags.</span><span>  Kay,  who  had  been  taking  things</span><span>  quietly,  came  Into  the  picture.  He  de</span><span>  lighted  his  supporters,  and  earned  the</span><span>  appreciation  of  the  home  slders,  by</span><span>  scoring  well  out.  He  added  paid  to  the</span><span>  account  with  a  splendid  kick.</span><span>  This  spurred  Beaudesert  and  in  a</span><span>  flash  they  had  McGovern  over,  with</span><span>  Panitz  kicking  the  goal.  Only  two</span><span>  minutes  of  play  remained,</span><span>  SECOND  MATCH</span><span>  Beaudesert's  B  grade  team  was  de</span><span>  feated  by  Wynnum's  second'  A  grade</span><span>  team  by  65  to  nil,  after  being  in  ar</span><span>  rears  27-0  at  half  time,</span><span>  The  order  in  which  Wynnum  scored</span><span>  is  as  follows:  J.

"<p><span>  BEAUDESERT,  PREMIERS</span></p> <p><span>  Beaudesert  Club,  by  defeating</span><span>  the  Christmas  Creek  team  by  24-10</span><span>  on  Sunday,  won  the  Beaudesert</span><span>  and  District  Rugby-  League  1946  A</span></p> <p><span>  grade  competutun,  having  ueen</span><span>  undefeated  on  the  field  in  that</span><span>  period,  although  they  forfeited  one</span><span>  »  match  to  Creek  during  the  last</span><span>  round.</span><span>  The  match,  played  at  the  Beau</span><span>  desert  show  grounds,  attracted</span><span>  a  gate  of  only  £11,  showing  how</span><span>  interest  in  the  game  had  waned.</span><span>  On  paper  it  looked  as  if  the  men</span><span>  from  the  country  would  have  a  chance,</span><span>  but  towards  the  latter  stages  of  the</span><span>  game  they  petered  out,  and  Beaudesert</span><span>  went  on  to  stack  up  the  points.</span><span>  At  half-time  Beaudesert  led  6-5,</span><span>  having  secured  the  points  per  medium</span><span>  of  the  boot  of  the  captain,  Sid  Cal-</span><span>  lanan.  He  added  another  two  soon</span><span>  after  half  time.</span><span>  The  season,  which  opened  with  great</span><span>  promise,  did  not  prove  the  success  that</span><span>  it  might  have.  The  withdrawal  of</span><span>  Waterloos  before  play  started  left  three</span><span>  teams  in  the  competition.  With  Ger-</span><span>  aghty  Cup  matches,  and  other  hap</span><span>  penings,  teams  did  not  get  the  foot</span><span>  ball  that  is  necessary  to  retain  interest</span><span>  of  players  and  supporters.  Canungra</span><span>  forfeited  to  Christmas  Creek  at  an</span><span>  early  stage,  and  in  the  last  round</span><span>  Creek  won  two  matches  without  hav</span><span>  ing  to  strip.</span></p> <p><span>  Naturally  this  upset  Creekers  who</span><span>  claim  that  they  were  given  a  ""raw""</span><span>  deal  because  the  two  teams  involved</span><span>  were  able  to  get  a  team  together  when</span><span>  the  match  was  on  their  home  grounds.</span><span>  In  addition  the  Ambulance  Cup  was</span><span>  also  made  a  fixture,  which  caused  dis</span><span>  satisfaction  with  some  of  the  offic:als,</span><span>  although  the  Ifengue  took  the  precau</span><span>  tion  to  have  both  Beaudesert  and</span><span>  Creek  agreeable  to  the  change  in  plans,</span><span>  Sunday's  match  did  not  have  any</span><span>  cf  the  cup  final  flavour  about  it</span><span>  from  any  point  of  view.  Except  for</span><span>  the  players,  there  was  little  enthus</span><span>  iasm  and  apparently  many  of  them</span><span>  were  not  enthusiastic  enough  to  train</span><span>  for  the  event.  The  home  combin</span><span>  ation  had  it  over  the  opposition,</span><span>  and  this  because  obvious  in  the  iat-</span><span>  ter  stages  when  the  points  began  to</span><span>  mount.</span><span>  Early,  Christmas  Creek  gave  away</span><span>  some  penalties,  which  proved  costly,</span><span>  but  in  the  first  half  there  were  13  to</span><span>  them,  and  ten  against.  Infringements</span><span>  in  the  rucks  gave  them  an  advantage</span><span>  after  half  time,  receiving  ten  to  three.</span><span>  Raking  honours  were  even  before</span><span>  half  time,  with  11  each,  and  the  ad-</span><span>  vantage  to  Creeks  after  oranges  was</span><span>  12-10.</span><span>  Collins,  who  has  been  out  of  com</span><span>  mission  with  an  injured  hand,  put  new</span><span>  life  into  Beaudesert's  play.  He  always</span><span>  moved  fast  when  he  received  the  bail,</span><span>  and  he  had  the  advantage  that  he</span><span>  was  given  more  protection  than  his</span><span>  vis-a-vis,  and.  besides  that,  his  for</span><span>  wards  broke  faster,  and  did  not  allow</span><span>  the  opposition  to  take  advantage  of</span><span>  the  ball  received.</span><span>  Plunkett  was  always  dangerous,  and</span><span>  Brosnan  earned  his  place  as  centre.  A</span><span>  quick  mover,  he  also  showed  that  he</span><span>  can  tackle  when  called  upon  to  do  so.</span><span>  Panitz  was  in  good  form  and,  while</span><span>  O'Brien  had  an  off  day  as  far  as  hand</span><span>  ling  was  concerned.  Wellington  was</span><span>  better  than  he  often  is  as  far  as  taking</span></p> <p><span>  the  ball  is  concerned.  S.  Callanan  was</span><span>  as  sound  as  ever.</span><span>  Beaudesert's  forwards  were  better  in</span><span>  all  departments,  and  F.  Callanan,  play</span><span>  ing  second  row,  was  seen  to  better  ad</span><span>  vantage  in  the  open  than  he  is  when</span><span>  tied  up  in  front  row.</span><span>  D.  Cahill,  who  broke  his  wrist  in  the</span><span>  first  interleague  match,  stripped  for</span><span>  the  first  time  since  then.  He  and  the</span><span>  remainder  of  Creek's  vanguard  were</span><span>  seen  to  advantage  spasmodically,  with</span><span>  V.  McGovern  the  pick  of  the  bunch.</span><span>  There  was  not  sufficient  cohesion  be</span><span>  tween  them  to  make  the  pack  a  serious</span><span>  strik.ng  force,  but  this  can  be  attribu</span><span>  ted  to  lack  of  match  play.</span><span>  The  game  was  in  charge  of  Mr.  S.</span><span>  McVie.</span><span>  .  Teams  were  as  follows:</span><span>  Christmas  Creek:  Full  back,  K.</span><span>  Ryan;  three-quarters.  D.  Rafter,  K.</span><span>  Morrisey,  D.  Doyle,  T.  Binstead;  five-</span><span>  eight,  P.  Deane;  half  back,  M.  Skelton;</span><span>  forwards,  F.  Sykes,  D.  Cahill,  V.</span><span>  O'Neill,  A.  Ward,  D.  Dennis,  V.  Mc</span><span>  Govern.</span><span>  Beaudesert:  Full  back,  S.  Callanan;</span><span>  three-quarters,  G.  Wellington,  K.</span><span>  Panitz,  J.  Brosnan,  E.  O'Brien;  five-</span><span>  eight,  Tom  Plunkett;  half  back,  W.</span><span>  Collins;  forwards.  R.  Dauth,  T.  Mur</span><span>  ray.  T.  Draper,  F.  Callanan,  K.  Little,</span><span>  W.  Day.</span><span>  In  the  first  minute  of  play  Christ</span><span>  mas  Creek  received  a  free  kick,  and</span><span>  McGovern  missed  a  shot  at  goal.  The</span><span>  visitors  continued  to  attack,  but  play</span><span>  was  transferred  to  halfway.  S.  Cal</span><span>  lanan  kicked  a  good  goal  from  well</span><span>  out  after  nine  minutes  of  play.</span><span>  Six  minutes  later  S.  Callanan  and</span><span>  Binstead  collided,  after  Callanan  had</span><span>  run  up,  and  just  delivered  the  ball.</span><span>  Both  were  out  of  commission  for  a</span><span>  lit  tie  time.  At  20  minutes  Sykes  missed</span><span>  a  kick  at  goal.  Wellington  failed  to</span><span>  hold  the  ball,  and  a  scrum  followed.</span><span>  Although  the  home  side  won  the</span><span>  leather,  they  were  hard  pressed,  and</span><span>  finally  kicked  clear,  to  relieve  their</span><span>  line.  Sykes  and  McGovern  came  back</span><span>  again,  but  the  side  was  penalised.  The</span><span>  kick  went  out  on  the  full.  The  scrum</span><span>  was  aga.n  won  by  Beaudesert,  and  they</span><span>  kicked  to  half  way.  At  24  minutes  S.</span><span>  Callanan  kicked  at  goal  but  it  failed.</span><span>  There  was  some  excitement  when</span><span>  Beaudesert  won  a  scrum.  The  ball</span><span>  went  out  to  Wellington,  who  looked  a</span><span>  chance.  As  Wellington  ran  along  the</span><span>  line  there  was  a  scatter  of  sawdust,</span><span>  causing  some  Christmas  Creek  officials</span><span>  to  clami  that  the  player  must  have</span><span>  been  out  for  the  line  to  be  disturbed.</span><span>  The  linesman  ruled  otherwise.  It  was</span><span>  a  close  call  for  Creeks.  At  32  minutes</span><span>  Callanan  again  raised  the  flags  from</span><span>  a  hard  angle.</span><span>  Another  three  minutes  and  Callanan</span><span>  added  a  further  two  points.</span><span>  Just  on  half  time  a  free  kick  was</span><span>  given  Creekers,  and  they  elected  to</span><span>  put  the  ball  into  the  air,  S.  Callanan</span><span>  who  was  behind  his  line,  took  the</span><span>  ball,  and  put  his  toe  into  it,  Mc</span><span>  Govern,  who  had  followed  on  fast,</span><span>  charged  the  ball,  stopping  its  pro-</span><span>  press.  He  then  dived  on  it  to  score,</span><span>  Some  claimed  that  he  touched  the</span><span>  leather  with  his  hands,  but  it  still</span><span>  would  not  have  made  it  a  knock  on,</span><span>  it  being  legal  to  touch  the  bali  in  a</span><span>  charge.  Sykes  made  no  mistake,  and</span><span>  Beaudesert  led  6  to  5.</span><span>  Christmas  Creek  resumed  playing</span><span>  into  the  sun.  They  were  called  on  to</span><span>  defend,  and  again  an  infringement  al</span><span>  lowed  Callanan  to  kick  a  goal.</span><span>  Collins  was  seen  in  a  great  piece  of</span><span>  work.  He  moved  from  the  base  of  the</span><span>  scrum,  cut  in  beside  it,  and  set  his</span><span>  side  in  operation.  When  the  ball  went</span><span>  to  O'Brien  he  knocked  on.  Creek  put</span><span>  in  some  solid  defensive  work  before</span><span>  they  were  able  to  clear.  Callanan</span><span>  missed  a  kick,  and  at  ten  minutes</span><span>  Sykes  also  failed.</span><span>  A  minute  later  Beaudesert  kicked</span><span>  from  the  home  line,  and  followed  on.</span><span>  Wellington  streaked  down  the  line  and</span><span>  toed  ahead.  Panitz  was  with  him,  and</span><span>  he  kicked  and  went  on  to  score.  There</span><span>  was  disagreement  about'  the  legality  of</span><span>  the  try,  it  being  claimed  that  a</span><span>  Creeker  going  for  the  ball  had  been</span><span>  illegally  tackled,  but  the  referee  ap</span><span>  parently  ruled  that  it  was  a  legal  push,</span><span>  Serious  interference  had  taken  place</span><span>  as  far  as  Panitz  was  concerned,  and</span><span>  had  he  been  stopped  by  the  Creek</span><span>  player,  the  referee  was  more  than  en</span><span>  titled  to  award  Beaudesert  a  penalty</span><span>  try.  Whatever  took  place  the  referee</span><span>  called  a  Creek  player  to  him,  and  spoke</span><span>  to  him.  Panitz  converted  his  effort,</span><span>  and  his  side  led  13-5.</span><span>  The  visiting  forwards  worked  like</span><span>  Trojans,  and  McGovern  'went  through</span><span>  the  ruck,  and  must  have  been  almost</span><span>  there  when  he  was  grounded.  A  five</span><span>  yards  scrum  was  the  outcome.  Beau</span><span>  desert  cleared:-  but  Dennis  came</span><span>  through,  ""and  left  Draper  standing</span><span>  watching  him  to  get  within  striking</span><span>  distance.  In  a  ruck  O'Neill  battled</span><span>  his  way  over.  Sykes  made  no  mistake,</span><span>  and  Beaudesert's  lead  was  reduced  to</span><span>  three  after  19  minutes.</span><span>  Dauth  attempted  a  long  kick  with</span><span>  out  success.  There  was  an  exchange  of</span><span>  kicks  between  fullbacks,  with  Creeker's</span><span>  representative-  practically  on  his  own</span><span>  line.  He  fumbled,  and  there  was  a  mix-</span><span>  up  that  finished  with  Wellington,  who</span><span>  had  followed  on,  diving  over  on  the</span><span>  loose  ball.  Callanan  missed  and  after</span><span>  25  minutes  the  score  was  16-10  Beau-</span></p> <p><span>  desert's  way.</span><span>  Ryan  and  Cahill  were  both  out  of</span><span>  commission  together,  and  Ryan  sub</span><span>  sequently  went  up,  and  Deane  dropped</span><span>  into  his  place.  At  39  minutes  Collins</span><span>  scored  from  an  individual  effort.  He</span><span>  found  a  great  opening  when  he  went</span><span>  around  the  scrum.  The  first  opposition</span><span>  was  the  fullback,  and  he  found  no</span><span>  trouble  in  swerving  around  him  and</span><span>  finishing  under  the  posts.  Dauth  did</span><span>  the  rest,  and  the  score  was  21-10.</span><span>  Creeks  were  completely  disorganised,</span><span>  and,  although  they  made  several  indi</span><span>  vidual  efforts,  Beaudesert  was  soon</span><span>  over.  Day  started  near  half  way,  and</span><span>  ran  for  the  corner,  to  beat  a  few  would</span><span>  be  defenders.  It  was  too  much  for</span><span>  Dauth.  Four  minutes  extra  time  was</span><span>  necessary  because  of  time  lost  through</span><span>  injuries.</span><span>  When  Creek  kicked  off  the  players</span><span>  were  determined  to  reduce  the  leeway.</span><span>  They  went  at  it  with  a  will,  and  they</span><span>  were  battling  hard  close  to  their  ob</span><span>  jective  when  the  final-  bell  went,  leav</span><span>  ing  them  defeated  by  24-10.</span><span>  THE  PREMIERSHIP</span><span>  At  the  conclusion  of  play  in  the</span><span>  competition  the  points  are  as  follows:</span><span>  j  e  I</span><span>  £  a  I  S</span><span>  I  5  I  '</span><span>  Beaudesert  ....  7  6  1  -  12</span><span>  Christmas  Ck  .  7  4  3  -  8</span><span>  Canungra  .  6  -  6</span><span>  POINTS  SCORERS</span><span>  The  table  of  points  scorers  in  com</span><span>  petition  matches  is  as  follows.

Harley,  however,  then  scored  .a</span><span>  six  to  equalise,  and  with  a  two  on  tlie</span><span>  hext  end  went  to  the  front  and  never</span><span>  surrendered  the  le£d  thereafter.</span><span>  Winning  seven  heads  out  of  eight,</span><span>  after  being  down  18-9  on  the  11th  end,</span><span>  Parker  got  to  within  one  of  Harley  on</span><span>  the  19th  head,  the  score  being  20-19,</span><span>  but  Harley's  four  thereafter  dominated</span><span>  the  play,  scoring  a  two  and  four  singles</span><span>  to  the  opposition's  single  and  won  by</span><span>  26  to  20.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Lancaster-Clarke  game  was  also</span><span>  productive  of  a  keen  struggle  over  the</span><span>  early  ends,  deciding  factor  being  a</span><span>  seven  on  the  13th  head  to  Lancaster,</span><span>  which  gave  him  a  lead  of  17-9.  Clarke</span><span>  won  the  next  three  heads  to  reduce  the</span><span>  leeway  to  two,  forfeited  a  two  and  then</span><span>  scored  a  five  to  take  the  lead  on  the</span><span>  18th  end  at  20-19.

Although  Clarke  won  three  of</span><span>  the  last  four  heads,  Lancaster  was  aoie</span><span>  to  maintain  his  advantage  to  win  by</span><span>  27-24.</span><span>  The  final,  played  on  the  Warwick</span><span>  East  green  in  the  afternoon,  was  an</span><span>  epic  struggle,  and  produced  some  of</span><span>  the  best  bowls  ever  seen  -  en  the</span><span>  green.</span><span>  Harley's  four  started  the  better  to</span><span>  lead  6-1  after  four  ends,  but  Lancaster</span><span>  scored  three  twos  In  succession  to  Har</span><span>  ley's  single  and  after  eight  heads  the</span><span>  scores  were  even  at  7-all.

J.  Ennght  pre</span><span>  sided.  Disappointment  was  expressed</span><span>  by  Mr.  Karoll  at  the  absence  of  re</span><span>  presentatives  of  other  organisations</span><span>  who  had  signified  their  intention  to  be</span><span>  present.  He  felt  that  they  were  sin</span><span>  cere,  and  if  they  recognised  the  im</span><span>  portance  of  this  movement  they  would</span><span>  be  keen  about  it.</span><span>  The  secretary  (Rev,  J.  J.  Wilson)</span><span>  suggested  that  a  circular  letter  be  for</span><span>  warded  to  all  organisations  before  the</span><span>  next  meeting  stating  just  what  is  to  be</span><span>  dealt  with  and  advising  the  date  of</span><span>  ihc  meeting.  Messrs.  W.  Blunck,  J.  J.</span><span>  Wilson,  and  T.  J.  Enright  were  ap</span><span>  pointed  a  sub-committee  to  draw  up  ,</span><span>  a  list  of  those  organisations  to  be</span><span>  circularised.</span><span>  ELECTRICITY</span><span>  Mr.  Lane  said  that  everybody  knows</span><span>  wlm  t  is  happening  with  regard  to  elec</span><span>  tricity  from  reports  in  the  press.  As</span><span>  far  as  water  is  concerned  the  corres</span><span>  pondence  gives  all  the  information  up</span><span>  to  lire  present  time.  It  is  the  intention</span><span>  of  the  City  Electric  Light  Co.  to  take</span><span>  certain  routes  front  Beaudesert  to  the</span><span>  rural  areas.  The  last  visit  of  Mr.  Guy</span><span>  L'Eslrange  to  the  rural  areas  was  for</span><span>  the  purpose  of  knowing  what  route  the</span><span>  lines  would  take.  The  coming  here  is  it</span><span>  means  to  an  end  and  they  must  go</span><span>  outside  to  balance  the  load.  He  was</span><span>  told  that  it  was  the  intention  of  the</span><span>  Company  to  make  circuits  right</span><span>  throughout  the  Shire  of  Beaudesert.</span><span>  Mr.  W.  Keaveny:  We  must  keep  on</span><span>  working  for  the  electrification  of  the</span><span>  country  areas  and  it  is  only  by  a  co</span><span>  operative  effort  that  this  will  come</span><span>  about.</span><span>  Mr.  Lane  said  that  he  expected  City</span><span>  Electric  Light  would  be  here  at  the</span><span>  end  of  April.</span><span>  Mr.  Karoii  moved  and  Mr.  W.  Kea</span><span>  veny  seconded  that  a  letter  be  for</span><span>  warded  to  the  State  Electricity  Com</span><span>  mission  expressing  appreciation  that  a</span><span>  start  lias  been  made  to  take  over  the</span><span>  Beaudesert  township  and  that  they  will</span><span>  see  their  way  clear  to  reticulate  the</span><span>  rural  areas  without  undue  delay.  The</span><span>  motion  was  carried.</span><span>  SECONDARY  SCHOOL</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Karoll  said  that  at  the  last</span><span>  meeting  four  men  were  appointed  to  :</span><span>  go  into  the  rural  curriculum,  but  ow-  ;</span><span>  ing  to  the  holidays  nothing  had  been  :</span><span>  done  in  that  particular  matter.  With  :</span><span>  regard  to  a  secondary  school,  a  letter</span><span>  was  sent  by  the  Department  to  Mr.  i</span><span>  Muller  stating  that  at  present  owing  j</span><span>  to  the  small  number  of  children  in  :</span><span>  the  higher  grades  there  would  not  be  j</span><span>  sufficient  to  carry  on  classes  they  j</span><span>  would  like  to  sec.  Since  then  fuvther  :</span><span>  information  has  been  sent  to  the  De-  j</span><span>  partment  which  has  thrown  another  :</span><span>  light  on  the  question,  and  the  matter  '</span><span>  is  now  in  their  hands.  The  numbers  i</span><span>  in  the  lower  grades  are  very  high,  and  :</span><span>  the  numbers  in  the  higher  grades,  very  ;</span><span>  small.  ;</span><span>  Mr.  Hodgson  said  he  could  not  :</span><span>  understand  why  tills  should  be  so.  The  :</span><span>  numbers  should  be  about  the  same</span><span>  unless  children  left  the  school  before  i</span><span>  reaching  the  higher  grades.  At  the  last  :</span><span>  scholarship  examinations  only  nine  or</span><span>  eleven  passed  in  the  whole  district  and</span><span>  lie  was  of  the  opinion  that  greater</span><span>  numbers  would  sit  for  the  examinations</span><span>  if  a  secondary  school  were  established  :</span><span>  in  tlie  district  so  Hint  children  could</span><span>  continue  their  studies.</span><span>  Mr.  Karoll  said  there  wore  40  in  .</span><span>  lower  grade  class  and  14  in  a  higher</span><span>  grade.  Lots  of  children  leave  before</span><span>  they  arc  14  years  of  age.  This  year  20</span><span>  sat  for  the  scholarship  examinations</span><span>  and  a  few  years  ago  50  sat.  He  was  of</span><span>  the  opinion  that  the  reason  for  this</span><span>  is  that  there  is  no  secondary  schooi</span><span>  in  the  area.</span></p> <p><span>  Rev.  J.  J.  Wilson  said  that  this  was</span><span>  a  very  vital  question.  Tlie  children  in</span><span>  the  country  should  not.  be  handicapped</span><span>  because  there  were  not  sufficient  num</span><span>  bers.  He  had  difficulty  in  getting  two</span><span>  boys  into  a  secondary  school  in  Bris</span><span>  bane.  Tlie  fees  are  high  and  some  who</span><span>  have  passed  their  scholarship  cannot</span><span>  get  accommodation.</span><span>  Mr.  Keaveny:  Anyone  who  puts  up  a</span><span>  good  case  will  get  what,  he  wants.</span><span>  Mr.  Enright  said  that  every  child</span><span>  should  have  a  secondary  education</span><span>  should  lie  or  she  desire  it.</span><span>  It  was  resolved  on  tlie  motion  of  Mr.</span><span>  P.  Hodgson,  seconded  by  Mr.  Wilson</span><span>  that  the  Minister  for  Public  Instruc</span><span>  tion  be  requested  to  establish  a  sec</span><span>  ondary  school  at  Beaudesert.  and  that</span><span>  a  copy  of  tlie  letter  be  forwarded  to</span><span>  Mr.  A.

"<p><span>  BEAUDESERT'S  FINAL</span><span>  BURST</span></p> <p><span>  Piling  on  points  in  the  latter</span><span>  stage  of  the  game,  Beaudesert</span><span>  Club  defeated  Canungra  in  the</span><span>  final  fixture  match  of  the  Beau-</span><span>  desert  and  District  Rugby  League</span></p> <p><span>  competition  played  at-  Canungra</span><span>  on  Sunday.</span><span>  At  half  time  the  scores  were</span><span>  three  all,  and  it  was  not  until  16</span><span>  minutes  of  the  second  half  had</span><span>  gone  that  Canungra  ""packed  up,""</span><span>  as  it  usually  does,  and  was  de</span><span>  feated  22-8.</span><span>  Beaudesert  unfolded  good  foot</span><span>  ball,  once  it  had  the  opposition  run</span><span>  off  its  feet,  and  there  were  .some</span><span>  classy  movements.</span><span>  The  game  was  poorly  attended.  Ca</span><span>  nungra  was  scrapping  until  the  last</span><span>  minute  to  get  a  team,  the  last  man</span><span>  being  secured  as  the  side  was  to  take</span><span>  the  field.</span><span>  Both  had  to  call  cin  players  who  were</span><span>  not-  considered  in  the  early  stages  of</span><span>  the  season.  It  was  farcical  to  see  the  -</span><span>  14  year  old  Frank  Parrish  matched</span><span>  with  the  tall  and  speedy  George  Wel</span><span>  lington.  The  lad,  who  has  a  ton  of</span><span>  football  brains,  and  the  ability  a  pro</span><span>  mising  player  requires,  did  not  disgrace</span><span>  himself  by  any  means,  but  he  is  not</span><span>  being  given  a  chance.  If  he  is  called  on</span><span>  to  play  this  class  of  football  next  sea</span><span>  son  he  will  be  ""burnt""  out  by  the  time</span><span>  that  he  has  developed,  and  should  be</span><span>  getting  to  his  prime  as  a  senior  player.</span><span>  It  will  be  surprising  if  he  reaches  the</span><span>  heights  that  he  may  achieve  if  he  is</span><span>  continually  called  on  to  face  older</span><span>  and  seasoned  footballers.  There  are</span><span>  limits  to  the  endurance  of  even  the</span><span>  toughest  boys.</span><span>  Beaudesert  won  a  majority  of  scrums,</span><span>  and,  even  when  it  lost  the  ball,  its  for</span><span>  wards  were  round  the  pack  smartly  to</span><span>  stifle  the  opposition  before  it  could  get</span><span>  going.  The  ""pigs""  turned  on  a  grand</span><span>  display  of  spotting.</span><span>  The  match  was  in  charge  of  Ref.  L.</span><span>  Jacobsen.</span><span>  Beaudesert  fielded:  Full  back.  P.</span><span>  Callanan;  three-quarters,  G.  Welling</span><span>  ton,  K.  Panitz,  T.  Kassulke.  E.

L'Estrange,  R.</span><span>  Smith.</span></p> <p><span>  J.  '  Finch  was  seen  in  a  nice  cut</span><span>  through  in  the  early  stages.  Wellington</span><span>  looked  like  getting  away,  and  he  had</span><span>  an  opening,  but  Parrish  grounded  him</span><span>  with  a  nice  tackle.  Holden  was  seen  in</span><span>  a  great  run.-  and  his  side  had  a  chance</span><span>  but  it  kicked  instead  of  passing.</span><span>  This  brought  about  a  change  to  Ca-</span><span>  nungra's  side,  Murphy  going  into  half</span><span>  back  position.  In  a  great  run  Holden</span><span>  all'  but  reached  his  objective.  Canun</span><span>  gra  was  given  a  free,  and  kicked  ahead</span><span>  which  allowed  Wellington  to  take  play</span><span>  to  half  way  before  he  was  stopped.</span><span>  After  play  had  been  in  progress  for</span><span>  16  minutes.  Smith,  who  was  making  an</span><span>  extra  back,  received  at  the  base.  &lt;,.,e</span><span>  scrum  near  quarter  r.ay  lie  went  di</span><span>  rect  for  the  ii'.ve,  and,  although  Wel</span><span>  lington  '-ras  h.-.ndy.  he  got  a  start.</span><span>  ?.rf(Vth  went  over  with  several  oppnsi-</span><span>  'i>i  'tying  to  push  htm  back.  Geiger</span><span>  .-a'cd,  and  Canungra  hitu  a  three  point</span><span>  -;ld.</span><span>  When  Wellington  dropped  a  pass,</span><span>  and  it  landed  in  Parrlsh's  hands,  the</span><span>  little  fellow  raced  half  the  length  of</span><span>  the  field  before  he  was  grassed  He  was</span><span>  on  his  own  and  the  advantage  was</span><span>  lost.  Beaudesert  transferred  the  thea</span><span>  tre  of  play  with  snappy  passing,  but</span><span>  that  to  Wellington,  when  he  was  all</span><span>  set  for  the  line,  was  forward.  Dauth</span><span>  attempted  a  kick  at  goal.</span><span>  Beaudesert  initiated  a  passing  move</span><span>  ment  and  the  ball  went  across  the  field</span><span>  from  hand  to  hand.  O'Brien  raced</span><span>  down  the  wing  at  top  speed,  and  took</span><span>  a  high  pass.  Nobody  had  a  chance  of</span><span>  getting  near  him  travelling  so  fast</span><span>  was  he.  Panitz  failed,  and  the  whistle</span><span>  sounded  with  the  scores  three  all.</span><span>  Soon  after  the  resumption  Smith</span><span>  sent  Murphy  away  on  a  great  run.  to</span><span>  be  grassed  near  the  line.  Beaudesert</span><span>  cleared  when  Canungra  was  given  a</span><span>  free  kick.  Smith  went  away  on  nis  own,</span><span>  but  he  was  not  given  support.</span><span>  Canungra  added  to  its  score  that</span><span>  came  as  a  surprise.  L'Estrange  had</span><span>  made  a  run,  but  he  was-  claimed  by</span><span>  two'  or  three  opponents.  His  own  side</span><span>  also'joined  in  the  tussle,  making  about</span><span>  six  players  in  a  wrestling  crowd.  Sud</span><span>  denly  Geiger,  who  must  have  pulled  the</span><span>  ball  out  was  seen  going  for  the  line  to</span><span>  force  his  way  over.  Play  had  been  in</span><span>  progress  for  seven  minutes.  E.  Day</span><span>  missed.</span><span>  A-  scrum  was  ordered  at  Canungra's</span><span>  quarter,  and  the  visitors  won  it.  The</span><span>  leather  went  to  Panitz,  who  finished</span><span>  off  a  good  movement.  Dauth  missed</span><span>  what  is  often  an  easy  one  for  him,</span><span>  and  at  16  minutes  the  scores  were  even</span><span>  at  six.</span><span>  J.  Pinch  retired  at  this  stage  with  a</span><span>  fractured  collarbone.  Beaudesert  took</span><span>  play  up,  and  the  opposition  was  held</span><span>  on  its  own  line.  A  free  kick  saw  Beau</span><span>  desert  put  the  ball  into  the  air,  and  a</span><span>  scrum  followed.  Loose  play  resulted,</span><span>  and  Panitz  sent  Wellinrrton  over.</span><span>  Panitz  raised  the  flags  with  a  great</span><span>  kick,  and  Beaudesert  led  11-6  after  18</span><span>  minutes.</span><span>  The  next  Beaudesert  try  was  an  easy</span><span>  one.  Starting  at  half  Way  the  baT  was</span><span>  slung  about,  for  Panitz  to  give  Wel-</span><span>  lingtqn  the  honours.  Panitz  missed  this</span><span>  time,  and  13  minutes  of  play  remained.</span><span>  Five  minutes  later  Wellington  re</span><span>  ceived  well  out  near  half  way.  He  raced</span><span>  infie'd  for  an  opening,  and  when  that</span><span>  was  closing,  he  wheeled,  and  swung  out</span><span>  again,  to  swerve  back,  and  make  a  gap</span><span>  that  allowed  him  to  finish  under  the</span><span>  uprights.  Day  missed  a  sitter.</span><span>  A  few  minutes  later  Holden  kicked  a,</span><span>  field  goal,  and  the  score  was  17-8.</span><span>  With  a  minute  to  go  Panitz  received,</span><span>  and,  swerving  in,  he  'threw  the  opposi</span><span>  tion  out  of  position.  He  turned  again,</span><span>  and  touched  down  where  the  goalkick-</span><span>  ers  like  them.

Sullivan  as  referee.</span><span>  The  encounter  served  to  show  that</span><span>  Beaudesert  has  the  material  required</span><span>  for  a  good  side,  but  the  players  will</span><span>  need  to  burn,  not  the  midnight  oil,  but</span><span>  some  of  the  early  evening  power  in</span><span>  training.  They  fielded  a  good  solid</span><span>  pack,  with  plenty  of  weight,  in  fact  a</span><span>  little  too  much,  when  it  comes  to  fol</span><span>  lowing  on  play,  and  backing  up.  More</span><span>  than  one  try  was  lost  to  Beaudesert</span><span>  because  of  the  inability  of  the  van</span><span>  guard  to  carry  on,  and  be  there  when</span><span>  the  fast  moving  backs  were  stopped</span><span>  almost  within  striking  distance.</span><span>  The  visitors  did  well  to  stave  olf  the</span><span>  opposition  for  so  long.  Their  side  was</span><span>  very  light-  in  comparison,  and  gener</span><span>  ally  speaking  were  mo:o  youthlul.</span><span>  They  stood  a  severe  gruelling,  and  on</span><span>  many  occasions  made  the  mistake  or</span><span>  keeping  the  ball  in  the  ruck,  instead  o.</span><span>  slinging  It  out  to  the  quarter  line.</span><span>  When  Canungra  did  finally  pack  up</span><span>  altogether,  Beaudesert  turned  on  sever</span><span>  al  passing  movements  that  had  the</span><span>  hallmark  of  quality  stamped  all  over</span><span>  them.  Players  were  a  little  too  keen  to</span><span>  score,  and  did  not  take  advaneage  of</span><span>  the  opportunity  of  making  a  practise  of</span><span>  it.</span><span>  It  is  always  advisable  when  well</span><span>  ahead  in  friendly  games  to  devote</span><span>  energy  towards  working  out  moves</span><span>  which  can  be  put  to  good  use  later.</span><span>  Beaudesert  has  two  good  wingers,</span><span>  who  should  produce  the  goods  if  they</span><span>  get  the  opportunities.  That  means  that</span><span>  the  inside  men  have  to  get  the  ball,  and</span><span>  ensure  that  they  draw  their  men.</span><span>  Time  after  time  on  Sunday  inside  men</span><span>  failed  to  run  straight,  with  the  result</span><span>  that  wingers  were  crowded  before  the</span><span>  leather  got  to  them.</span><span>  G.  Wellington,  a  newcomer  to  the</span><span>  district,  looks  like  being  a  scoring</span><span>  machine  once  he  settles  down,  and  K.</span><span>  Panitz  should  hold  his  own  against</span><span>  anybody  likely  to  oppose  him  in  the</span><span>  fixtures.</span><span>  The  Beaudesert  forwards'  gave  W.</span><span>  Collins  a  good  share  of  the  ball,  and  he</span><span>  exploited  several  nice  moves,  with  suc</span><span>  cess,  but  needs  to  have  better  under</span><span>  standing  with  his  teammates  for  these</span><span>  tricks  of  the  trade  to  continually  pay</span><span>  dividends.</span><span>  .  Better  handling  will  come  naturally</span><span>  If  the  team  concentrates  on  its  training.</span><span>  Canungra  players  were  better  condit</span><span>  ioned,  but  they  could  net  stand  the</span><span>  continued  pounding  of  the  opposition.</span><span>  Some  unnecessary  buffeting  was  en</span><span>  countered  trying  to  play  a  heavier  side</span><span>  at  its  own  game  when  it  adopted  for</span><span>  ward  tactics.</span><span>  Scoring  opened  when  S.  Callanan</span><span>  kicked  a  goal.  Five  minutes  earlier</span></p> <p><span>  he  missed  a  fairly  easy  one.</span><span>  Shortly  after  the  interval  Wellington</span><span>  was  sent  over'  in  the  corner,  Panitz</span><span>  raised  the  flags  with  a  beautiful  kick</span><span>  from  a  few  yards  from  the  side  line.</span><span>  ,  Five  minutes  later  a  passing  move</span><span>  ment  in  which  the  ball  went  out  to</span><span>  Plunkett,  and  then  to  Panitz,  saw  the</span><span>  latter  go  under  the  posts.  Panitz  added</span><span>  the  other  two,  and  the  score  was  12  to</span><span>  nil.</span><span>  From  loose  play  Dauth  scored,  but</span><span>  Panitz.  missed.</span><span>  A  movement  in  which  Plunkett,  Day</span><span>  and  Wellington  featured  had  its  reward</span><span>  with  Dauth  scoring  in  the  corner.  Call</span><span>  anan  missed.</span><span>  The  ball  was  kicked  well  into  the</span><span>  Beaudesert's  territory  from  the  kick</span><span>  off  but  Beaudesert  turned  on  classy</span><span>  football  to  transfer  play  to  within  a</span><span>  few  yards  of  their  objective,  Panitz</span><span>  secured  and  scored,  for  Dauth  to</span><span>  earn  applause  with  a  good  kick.</span><span>  With  three  minutes  to  go  Wellington</span><span>  crossed,  after  shaking  off  several  would</span><span>  be  tacklers.  Dauth  missed.</span><span>  Scoring  was  not  over  because  Panitz</span><span>  received  the  pill,  changed  direction,</span><span>  throwing  the  tired  defenders  off  their</span><span>  balance.  He  had  an  open  go  for  the</span><span>  posts.

Harrison,  a  director,  and  member  of  the  Milk  Board,</span><span>  informed  the  meeting  that  the  last  official  tests  of  milk  supplied  to</span><span>  the  Brisbane  market  had  shown  that  this  Beaudesert  milk  was  at  the</span><span>  top  of  the  list  of  supplying  factories  as  regards  butterfat  content  and</span><span>  keeping  quality,  but  he  advised  suppliers  not  to  rest  on  their  oars.</span><span>  The  district  had  also  increased  its  supply  in  time  of  drought.</span><span>  The  amount  of  deferred  pay  available  for  distribution—  £12,494/3/10</span><span>  for  cream,  and  £703/15/5  for  milk—  was  the  largest  amount  paid  in</span><span>  this  way.

There  were  34  co-operative</span><span>  company  members,  and  a  great  num</span><span>  ber  of  them  were  dairy  associations.</span><span>  All  the  companies  that  took  the  trouble</span><span>  to  find  what  the  union  was  doing,  and</span><span>  what  it  proposed  to  do,  commended  the</span><span>  work  of  the  union.

The  figures  of  the  factory</span><span>  compared  very  favourably  with  those</span><span>  of  others.  The  cost  of  production  was</span><span>  1.71(1.  He  was  agreeably  surprised  to</span><span>  see  the  figures  after  the  time  they</span><span>  had  been  through.  The  figure  was</span><span>  the  second  lowest  of  any  factory</span><span>  figure  they  knew  of.</span><span>  To  Mr.  Richardson  the  chairman</span><span>  said  that  the  treatment  cost  of  milk</span><span>  was  Id.  a  gallon,  which  was  the  usual</span><span>  charge.</span><span>  Mr.  A.  S.  Hudson  said  that  as  far  as</span><span>  the  manufacture  of  butter  was  con</span><span>  cerned  a  creditable  return  to  share</span><span>  holders  was  shown.  He  viewed  the</span><span>  future  of  butter  with  a  certain  amount</span><span>  of  alarm,  He  was  more  concerned</span><span>  about  milk.  When  things  looked  smooth</span><span>  he  was  inclined  to  look  ahead  to  the</span><span>  time  when  the  fall  would  come.  Beau-</span><span>  desert's  milk  had  been  criticised  as  to</span><span>  quality.  He  thought  that  it  was  exag</span><span>  geration  but  It  was  claimed  that  the</span><span>  milk  was  poor  quality.  He  thought  it</span><span>  was  the  duty  of  the  factory  to  go  into</span><span>  the  matter,  and  explore  every  avenue</span><span>  to  see  that  the  milk  was  improved.</span><span>  Mr.  Hudson  referred  to  the  lead  some  ""</span><span>  other  interests  were  giving,  and  in</span><span>  stanced  where  one  Northern  Rivers,</span><span>  N.S.W.  company  would  assist  farmers</span><span>  by  buying  a  bull,  If  required.  He  was</span><span>  not  criticising  the  directors,  but  they</span><span>  might  go  Into  this  phase  of  trying  to</span><span>  bring  about  ,  improvements.  It  was  no</span><span>  use  shutting  their  eyes  to  the  criticism,</span><span>  and  the  more  they  advertised  It  the</span><span>  more  they  would  boost  their  problem</span><span>  Along.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Hudson  expressed  himself  as</span><span>  being  100  per  cent.  In  favour  of  herd</span><span>  testing,  and  said  that  he  thought  every</span><span>  hera  prov.dmg  mi:k  suould  oe  tested</span><span>  lor  milk.  He  thought  die  matter  was  a</span><span>  factory  obligation,  ana  die  factory</span><span>  should  pay  ail  costs  and  debit  all  sup</span><span>  pliers.  He  understood  that  it  cost  3/-</span><span>  a  cow  to  test,  and  lie  personal.y  was</span><span>  not  going  to  pay  that.</span><span>  Mr.  Hudson  said  that  it  was  worth</span><span>  inquiring  as  to  whether  they  could</span><span>  provide  milk  for  a  company  asking  for</span><span>  2,000  gallons  a  day.  They  wanted  all</span><span>  the  avenues  of  demand  they  could  get.</span><span>  He  suggested  the  possibility  of  regis</span><span>  tering  as  milk  wholesalers  m  Bnsoane</span><span>  with  their  own  floor.</span><span>  Mr.  Hudson  advocated  sending  the</span><span>  manager  about  to  inspect  other  fac</span><span>  tories,  and  so  bring  back  new  ideas.  If</span><span>  Mr.  Wilshire  had  not  been  abroad  he</span><span>  offered  it  as  a  suggestion.</span><span>  Mr.  Hudson  sa.d  that  he  did  not</span><span>  think  the  matter  of  a  veterinary  sur</span><span>  geon  should  have  been  put  before  tiie</span><span>  shareholders,  and  he  thought  the  sub</span><span>  ject  should  be  reviewed  by  the  board,</span><span>  which  had  been  put  there  by  the</span><span>  shareholders.  A  veterinary  surgeon  was</span><span>  necessary  in  the  district,  and  what  he</span><span>  had  lost  by  not  havmg  such  services</span><span>  available  would  have  provided  8  p.c.</span><span>  on  the  salary  the  veterinary  would</span><span>  have  been  paid.  Tiie  d.sirict  was  big</span><span>  enough  to  provide  a  veterinary.</span><span>  Mr.  Hudson  said  that  the  figures</span><span>  produced  showed  the  ability  of  the  di</span><span>  rectors  to  handle  the  affairs  of  the</span><span>  shareholders.</span><span>  Mr.  Piunkett  said  that  lie  was</span><span>  pleased  to  know  tliat  the  quality  of</span><span>  the  Beaudesert  milk  had  improved</span><span>  and  tliey  had  asked  Mr.  Harrison  to</span><span>  keep  a  tag  on  the  quality.</span><span>  Mr.  Piunkett  said  lie  had  discussed</span><span>  the  matter  of  herd  testing  with  the</span><span>  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Stock</span><span>  (Mr.  H.  H.  Collins).  He  recognised  that</span><span>  in  any  scheme  unless  tliey  got  the</span><span>  official  stamp  on  it  Is  was  not  much</span><span>  good.  In  Victoria  tliey  were  paying  6/-</span><span>  a  head  for  testing.  He  aiso  brought  up</span><span>  the  matter  at  the  Australian  Dairy</span><span>  Produce  Board,,  anil  suggested  that</span><span>  body  be  the  foundation  head  of  a  herd</span><span>  testing  scheme,  and  suggested  it  be</span><span>  done  in  the  same  way  in  all  states.</span><span>  N.S.W.  scheme  was  different  to  that  of</span><span>  Victoria.  His  idea  was  to  get  uniform</span><span>  ity  so  that  testing  would  be  recognised</span><span>  all  over  the  Commonwealth.  The  ad</span><span>  vantages  to  farmers  would  more  than</span><span>  pay  the  cost  of  the  scheme.</span><span>  Mr.  Piunkett  said  that  they  had  an</span><span>  inquiry  regarding  luriher  milk  but</span><span>  they  decided  that,  tliey  might  get  into</span><span>  difficulties  over  the  matter.  The  dairy</span><span>  ing  industry  should  take  into  consid</span><span>  eration.  and  as  a  matter  of  fact  it  had</span><span>  considered  the  matter,  of  a  selling</span><span>  floor,  the  idea  being  that  the  farmer</span><span>  snouid  get  the  fun  benefit  from  his</span><span>  production.  Previous  difficulties  might</span><span>  nave  gone  by  the  board  with  new</span><span>  legislation  being  introduced.  The  fac</span><span>  tory  had  been  given  a  fair  spin  from</span><span>  its  wholesaler.  If  they  were  going  to</span><span>  look  to  the  future,  and  hand  their  milk</span><span>  over  to  somebody  else,  it  was  not  co</span><span>  operative.</span><span>  Mr.  Piunkett  said  that  it  was  a  good</span><span>  idea  to  send  the  manager  around.</span><span>  Nothing  was  done  in  New  Zealand</span><span>  that  they  did  not  know.  An  expert  told</span><span>  him  it  had  been  -proved  that  a  bull  put</span></p> <p><span>  the  butterfat'int'o  the  cow,  irrespective</span><span>  of  the  ability  of  the  mother  of  the  cow</span><span>  to  produce.  Hd  also  said  it  paid  to</span><span>  have  a  veterinary  to  rush  to  if  they</span><span>  had  illness  in  their  stock.</span><span>  Mr.  Harrison  said  that  a  ""recent</span><span>  report  seen  by  him  gave  returns  of</span><span>  two  samples  of  milk  from  all  sup</span><span>  plying  factories.  Beaudesert  was  at</span><span>  the  top  of  Die  list.</span><span>  Voices:  Hear,  hear.</span><span>  Although  nn  improvement  in  but</span><span>  ter  fat  and  keeping  quality  was</span><span>  shown.  Mr.  Harrison  said  it  was  not</span><span>  wise  to  get  too  optimistic  because</span><span>  tests  varied,  lie  had  always  doubted</span><span>  the  fact  thai  Beaudesert's  tests  were</span><span>  the  worst  of  the  lot.  This  time  he</span><span>  was  able  to  get  the  test  officially.</span><span>  The  daily  average  supply  figures</span><span>  from  July  last  year  to  August  showed</span><span>  an  increase.  Beaudesert  held  its  posi-</span><span>  t'on  despite  the  drought.  He  did  not</span><span>  think  that  there  was  a  district  that</span><span>  had  maintained  its  supply  as  Beau</span><span>  desert  had.  Tn  July,  when  the  condi</span><span>  tions  were  good  the  figure  was  2,100</span><span>  gallons.  Others  were  August  1,700,  Sep</span><span>  tember  1,700,  October,  November  1,400,</span><span>  December  1700,  January  1,800,  Febru</span><span>  ary  2,200,  March  1,800,  April  1,900.  May</span><span>  and  June  2,000,  July  2.200,  and  last</span><span>  month  it  was  expected  to  be  2,500.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Harrison  said  that  this  showed</span><span>  the  ability  of  the  district  to  produce</span><span>  in  probably  the  worst  drought  they</span><span>  had  had.  He  said  that  the  Chairman  of</span><span>  the  Co-operative  Union  intended  mov</span><span>  ing  to  call  the  appropriate  peop.e  to</span><span>  gether  to  discuss  the  problem  of  a  milk</span><span>  ttoor  in  Brisbane.</span><span>  Mr,  Plunkctt  said  that  tlje  factories</span><span>  had  been  called  together  on  a  num</span><span>  ber  of  occasions.  He  was  glad  to  hear</span><span>  the  remarks  on  herd  testing,  and  a</span><span>  vetenn.,  iy  officer.  They  were  things</span><span>  that  were  wanted  badly.  He  thought</span><span>  they  should  go  for  a  veterinary  officer</span><span>  when  one  was  available,  and  give  sup</span><span>  port  to  a  herd  testing  scheme.</span><span>  Mr.  Piunkett  said  that  it  was  not</span><span>  the  fault  of  the  factory  that  tliey  did</span><span>  not  have  more  coolh.g  towers  in  the</span><span>  district.  The  producers  did  not  come</span><span>  along  with  the  readiness  to  put  them</span><span>  in,  and  there  was  a  shortage  of  trades</span><span>  men.  There  was  apathy  on  the  part  of</span><span>  the  suppliers  to  provide  the  equipment</span><span>  which  would  improve  the  quality  of</span><span>  their  milk.</span><span>  Mr.  Piunkett  said  that  the  Butter</span><span>  Board  was  experimenting  with  home</span><span>  refrigerators,  which  would  provide  for</span><span>  household  supplies  and  milk.  He  was</span><span>  informed  that  under  mass  production</span><span>  conditions  the  unit  could  be  produced</span><span>  for  £120.  It  was  not  ready  to  put  on</span><span>  the  market.  They  had  involved  the</span><span>  Commonwealth  Government  in  help</span><span>  ing  to  finance  the  scheme  on  reasonr</span><span>  able  lines.  »</span><span>  Mr.  J.  Hopkins  asked  if  members  did</span><span>  not  think  that  poor  quality  could  be</span><span>  attributed  to  obsolete  methods  of</span><span>  transport,  and  referred  to  having  to</span><span>  stop  a  vehicle  for  two  hours  to  allow</span><span>  the  tyres  to  cool  off</span><span>  Mr.  Harrison  said  that  the  milk  fig</span><span>  ures  quoted  were  for  the  factory  only.</span><span>  Mr.  Piunkett  said  that  they  could</span><span>  not  get  professional  men  to  join  the</span><span>  staff  as  there  was  no  accommodation</span><span>  available  at  Beaudesert.  It  appeared</span><span>  that  in  the  not  very  far  distant  future</span><span>  they  would  have  to  move  the  residence</span><span>  of  the  manager  to  the  block  of  land</span><span>  on  which  they  had  built  a  cottage.  If</span><span>  the  residence  was  removed,  they  would</span><span>  have  room  to  go  ahead,  because  they</span><span>  could  not  expand  the  other  way.</span><span>  Mr.  Piunkett  said  that  a  milk  tanker</span><span>  cost  £5,000  and.  it  was  made  in  Mel-</span></p> ",Article,1946-10-04,Beaudesert Milk Tops Test,216078348,6,6,"{'score': '2260.3591', 'value': 'very relevant'}","DAIRY farmers were given very heartening news on Saturday when attending the annual meeting of suppliers to the Logan and Albert Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd, The Chairman (Mr, T.

It  was  understand</span><span>  able  that  he  should  be  restricted  in  his</span><span>  efforts  because  he  suffered  an  attack</span><span>  of  malaria  during  the  week.  Frank  Cal</span><span>  lanan  was  a  tower  of  strength  hi  the</span><span>  open,  and  took  part  in  several  good</span><span>  movements.</span><span>  Collins  and  S.  Callanan  worked</span><span>  well  behind  the  scrum,  but  did  not</span><span>  have  the  understanding  that  is</span><span>  necessary  for  the  pivot  men  to  have</span><span>  with  their  quarter  line.  Collins  has  a</span><span>  ,  nice  cut  in  movement,  but  has  a</span><span>  tendency  to  overwork  it  instead  of</span><span>  using  his  supports.</span><span>  O'Brien  was  given  no  end  of  work,</span><span>  and  stood  up  to  it  well.  Unfortunately</span><span>  he  is  prepared  to  take  the  dump  more</span><span>  than  he  should,  and  he  was  given  this</span><span>  far  too  often.  Gameness  is  not  every</span><span>  thing.</span><span>  Almost  without  exception  O'Brien</span></p> <p><span>  was  crowded  when  the  ball  got  to  him,</span><span>  because  his  inside  men  would  do  every</span><span>  thing  but  run  straight  ahead,  and  draw</span><span>  the  attack  before  passing.  If  tlie  cen</span><span>  tres  could  overcome  this  trouble  their</span><span>  side  would  score  more  tries  than  they</span><span>  do.</span><span>  P.  Deane,  the  Creek  captain,  was</span><span>  ever  on  the  go,  and  he  received  a  nasty</span><span>  bump  over  the  eye  which  required</span><span>  medical  attention.  F.  Sykes,  a  winger,</span><span>  has  a  good  turn  of  speed,  and  will</span><span>  always  be  dangerous.  Their  half.  Skel-</span><span>  toh,  did  some  nice  work,  and  K.  Ryan,</span><span>  who  started  at  full-back,  but  suffered</span><span>  a  leg  injury  early  in  the  second  half,</span><span>  blossomed  as  a  forward.  The  pick  of</span><span>  the  pack  was  McGovcrn,  who  was  on</span><span>  the  ball  all  the  time.  The  vanguard  de</span><span>  fended  well.</span><span>  Both  sides  were  too  prone  to  keep  the</span><span>  ball  in  the  ""pigs""  many  being  satisfied</span><span>  to  adopt  soccer  rules  far  too  much.</span><span>  This  robbed  the  game  of  much  of  its</span><span>  interest.</span><span>  The  Hillview  field  is  not  all  that  it</span><span>  might  be,  and  it  is  up  to  the  home</span><span>  club  to  consider  plans  'for  its  im</span><span>  provement.

"<p><span>  Win  fox  Beaudesert</span></p> <p><span>  By  defeating  the  South  Coast  team  by  27-9  in  the  Geraghty  Cup</span><span>  j  competition  match  at  the  Beaudesert  Show  Grounds  on  Sunday,  Bean-</span><span>  desert  and  Wynnum  have  won  three  matches  each  in  the  competition,</span><span>  which  entitles  them  to  play  off  in  Brisbane.</span></p> <p><span>  With  the  home  side  outraked,  and  very  often  outruckcd,  it  did  very</span><span>  well  to  win,  although  the  back  division  was  far  better  than  that</span><span>  brought  from  Southport.  In  addition  Beaudesert  was  without  one  of</span><span>  its  best  open  forwards,  K.  Holden,  for  all  but  nine  minutes  of  the</span><span>  second  half,  that  player  having  been  injured.</span><span>  The  gate  takings  were  £44,  as  against  almost  the  century  when</span><span>  Wynnutn  played  earlier  in  the  season.  The  only  means  of  transport</span><span>  this  time  was  by  rail  motor  and  car,  whereas  Wynnum  League  was</span><span>  able  to  charter  a  special  train.</span><span>  The,  reserve  team  won  its  first  match  of  the  season,  showing  vastly</span><span>  unproved  form.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Beaudesert  side  took  the  field</span><span>  as  selected  a  week  earlier,  Had  the</span><span>  backs  received  more  of  the  ball  the  vic</span><span>  tory  wouid  no  doubt  have  been  greater.</span><span>  In  the  first  half  the  home  side  won</span><span>  12  scrums  against  18  by  the  opposi</span><span>  tion,  and  in  tne  second  hall  they  had</span><span>  nine  to  15  against  them.</span><span>  Beaudesert  continually  infringed,  and</span><span>  belore  half  time,  received  but  four  of</span><span>  the  13  free  kicks,  and,  after  oranges,</span><span>  it  was  6  to  2  against  them.</span><span>  With  so  little  ball  the  team  did  well</span><span>  to  hold  its  own.  At  times  Beaudesert</span><span>  unfolded  brilliant  football,  slinging  the</span><span>  ball  about  with  abounden.  Then  at</span><span>  times  Beaudesert  was  like  a  ship  at</span><span>  sea.  Players  stood  while  heavy  opposi</span><span>  tion  lorwards  barged  through,  reducing</span><span>  valuable  ground.</span><span>  It  was  a  tar  better  side  than  that</span><span>  fielded  at  Wynnum,  but  it  will  have  to</span><span>  improve  to  nave  a  chance  against</span><span>  Wynnum  in  the  final.</span><span>  The  material  is  there,  and  training</span><span>  together  for  several  nights  a  week  for  a</span><span>  lortnight  would  work  wonders.</span><span>  The  selectors  should  have  seen  the,</span><span>  fallacy  of  ""tieing""  Smith  up  in  the</span><span>  scrums.  Had  he  oeen  a  free  lance  all</span><span>  the  time  he  would  have  given  more</span><span>  worry  to  the  men-  from  the  seaside.  As</span><span>  it  was  he  scored  two  tries,  and  saved</span><span>  his  side  some  trouble  more  than  once.</span><span>  After  K.  Holden  had  been  hurt  the</span><span>  .  pack  was  rearranged,  allowing  Smith</span><span>  freedom  in  this  regard.</span><span>  Holden  made  some  good  runs,  but</span><span>  was  not  as  outstanding  as  he  has  been.</span><span>  O'Neill  was  seen  continually  in  the</span><span>  rucks,  and,  after  he  settled  down,  F.</span><span>  Callanan  was  seen  in  the  open.</span><span>  Behind  the  pack  Day  started  some</span><span>  scoring  movements,  and  except  for</span><span>  weaknesses  in  passing,  the  backs  could</span><span>  not  be  condemned.  O'Brien  covered</span><span>  himself  in  glory  by  his  topnotch  per</span><span>  formance.  Once  he  received  the  ball  he</span><span>  took  some  stopping,  despite  his  lack</span><span>  of  weight.  Cqlianan's  fullback  display</span><span>  was  everything  that  could  be  desired,</span><span>  his  faults  being  slight,  even  though  he</span><span>  had  to  work  hard.  It  was  unfortunate</span><span>  that  (lie  setting  sun  hi  the  closing</span><span>  stages  had  the  ball  obscured  because</span><span>  a  try  was  scored  through  this.</span></p> <p><span>  Tlie  outstanding  player  for  the  visit</span><span>  ors  was  M.

He  was  a  fast  mover,  and</span><span>  he  gave  some  trouble,  being  so  elusive,</span><span>  and  receiving  so  much  bail  and  pro</span><span>  tection  from  his  forwards.  M.  Napper</span><span>  always  seemed  to  be  there  when  mere</span><span>  was  a  chance  of  his  side  scoring.</span><span>  The  teams  were;</span><span>  South  Coast:  Fullback,  D.  McMahon;</span><span>  three-quarters,  T.  Berrigan,  C.  Melrose,</span><span>  M.  Napper,  c.  McDonald;  five-eight,  N.</span><span>  Wintle;  half  back,  M.  Dowling;  for</span><span>  wards,  J.  Guinea,  Ray  Collings,  L.</span><span>  Smith,  F.  Collings.  C.  Rankm,  A.</span><span>  Slingsby.</span><span>  Beaudesert:  Fullback,  S.  Callanan;</span><span>  three-quarters,  G.  Wellington,  K.</span><span>  Panitz,  P.  Deane,  E.  O'Brien;  -five-</span><span>  eight.  T.  Plunkett;  half  back,  W.  Day;</span><span>  forwards,  V.  McGovern,  R.  Smith,  R.</span><span>  Dauth,  V.  O'Neill,  K.  Holden,  F.  Cal</span><span>  lanan.</span><span>  Smith  went  close  to  scoring  in  the</span><span>  first  minute  of  play.  F.  Callanan  kicked</span><span>  and  Holden  followed  on  and  caught  it.</span><span>  but  his  pass  to  Callanan  was  knocked</span><span>  on.  Beaudesert  unfolded  good  football,</span><span>  taking  play  half  the  length  of  the  field</span><span>  with  about  eight  players  handling  the</span><span>  leather  as  It  was  transferred  from  one</span><span>  sideline  to  the  other.  S.  Callanan</span><span>  caused  the  opposition  fullback  to</span><span>  knock  on  in  Ills  own  quarter,  but  the</span><span>  attackers  stood  back,  and  the  oppor</span><span>  tunity  was  lost.</span><span>  O'Brien  Intercepted  a  pass  well  over</span><span>  his  half  way  when  he  was  at  his  top.</span><span>  and  he  went  to  McMahon.  He  short</span><span>  kicked  over  McMahon's  head,  and  raced</span><span>  for  the  line  with  several  players  handy.</span><span>  The  ruling  was  a  try  by  McGovern.</span><span>  Panitz  did  the  rest,  and,  after  12  min</span><span>  utes,  Beaudesert  led  by  five  points.</span><span>  Beaudesert  started  a  movement  from</span><span>  its  own  line.  S.  Callanan  cut  holes  in</span><span>  the  opposition,  and  took  play  to  half</span><span>  way.  The  opposition  came  back,  and'</span><span>  Wellington  kicked  out  of  touch  just  In</span><span>  time.</span><span>  Soon  after  Beaudesert  was  again</span><span>  called  on  to  defend  and  this  time</span><span>  Smith  bustled  through  the  ruck,  and.</span><span>  was  not  grounded  until  he  had  reached</span><span>  half  way.</span><span>  Beaudesert  won  a  scrum  awarded</span><span>  for  a  breach  and  Day,  receiving,</span><span>  worked  the  blind  side.  He  ran  out  to</span><span>  wards  the  line,  at  the  same  time  calling</span><span>  instructions  to  O'Brien.  The  latter  con</span><span>  tinued  to  run  almost  beside  him,  as  if</span><span>  expecting  the  ball,  but  he  swung  in,</span><span>  and  took  an  inpass  at  the  quarter  line.</span><span>  A  race  for  the  line  followed.  An  op</span><span>  position  player  reached  out  for</span><span>  O'Brien's  jersey,  but  just  missed,  and</span><span>  by  that  time  O'Brien  had  crossed  the</span><span>  chalk/.  Panitz  missed  an  easy  one,  and</span><span>  bis  side  led  8.0,</span><span>  The  locals  went  up  again,  and  In  a</span><span>  scramble  Wellington  was  penalised  for</span><span>  pushing  tlie  opposition  in  an  effort  to</span><span>  get  the  ball.  Two  minutes  later  tlie</span><span>  leather  was  kicked  to  Panitz,  who</span><span>  failed  to  get  close  enough  to  get  Ills</span><span>  hands  on  It.  It  appeared  to  bounce  off</span><span>  his  legs  near  the  knees.  He  picked  up</span><span>  when  it  bounced,  and  ran  to  the  op</span><span>  position  quarter,  and  finished  up  5  yards</span><span>  from  the  post.  Panitz  did  the  rest,  giv</span><span>  ing  his  side  a  13  point  lead.</span><span>  Smith  was  responsible  for  starting</span><span>  the  movement  that  gave  the  next  try.</span><span>  He  sent  Plunkett  down  the  middle  of</span><span>  the  field,  and  in  turn  he  passed  to  P.</span><span>  Deane  and  he  gave  to  O'Brien.  That</span><span>  player  went  to  McMahon.  but  appar</span><span>  ently  he  was  doubtful  if  he  could  get</span><span>  the  ball  to  his  supporters  when  tliev</span></p> <p><span>  were  ln.position.  Instead  of  sending  a</span><span>  doubtful  pass  lie  poked  the  ball  at  Mc</span><span>  Mahon  several  times  and  that  player</span><span>  swallowed  the  trick,  and  O'Brien  was</span><span>  over.  S.  Callanan  missed,  and  with</span><span>  four  minutes  to  half  time  Beaudesert</span><span>  led  16-0.</span><span>  F.  Callanan  was  seen  In  a-  great  run,</span><span>  but  the  visitors  came  back  with  a  rush</span><span>  just  on  the  bell.</span><span>  After  lemons  South  Coast  came  back</span><span>  strong,  and  went  at  it  with  a  will,  pin</span><span>  ning  the  opposition  In  its  own  quarter.</span><span>  Holden  started  well  back  on  his  own.</span><span>  After  crossing  the  halfway  line  he  was</span><span>  tackjed,  spearing  into  the  ground  with</span><span>  great  force.  This  put  him  out  of  com</span><span>  mission  for  a  minute.  He  was  able  to</span><span>  resume,  but  a  minute  later  went  down</span><span>  to  a  tackle.  An  examination  revealed  a</span><span>  fractured  collarbone.  Play  had  been  In</span><span>  progress  8i  minutes.</span><span>  South  Coast  got  away  and  their  play</span><span>  ers  moved  half  the  length  of  the  field.</span><span>  Wellington  downed  his  man  when  a  try</span><span>  was  In  the  offing.  Ruck  play  followed,</span><span>  and  Dowling  went  over.  Wintle  failed.</span><span>  Shortly  after  Smith'  went  over  to  the</span><span>  corner  from  a  ruck,  and  Dauth  failed,</span><span>  making  the  score  19-3.  /</span><span>  Dowling  was  Injured,  but  was  able</span><span>  to  resume  a  few  minutes  .later.  With</span><span>  his  side  under  pressure,  Wellington</span><span>  kicked  ahead,  but  the  ball  bounced</span></p> <p><span>  high  towards  Beaudescrt's  quarter,</span><span>  beating  the  locals.  Napper  secured,</span><span>  and  he  passed  to  Dowling,  for  him  to</span><span>  score.  The  kick  failed,  and  after  24</span><span>  minutes,  the  visitors  were  19-6  In  ar</span><span>  rears.</span><span>  Smith  scored  a  try,  running  ,irom</span><span>  tlie  opposition  quarter  line.  Dauth</span><span>  missed.  Panitz  set  off  from  his  own</span><span>  quarter,  and  S.  Callanan,  who  ran  up</span><span>  from  the  fullback  position,  was  there</span><span>  -  to  take  his  pass.  He  dummied  when  he</span><span>  got  to  McMahon,  and  drew  his  man.</span><span>  While  he  may  have  got  there  by  going</span><span>  on  his  own  he  sent  an  easy  pass  to</span><span>  Deane,  who  completed  the  remaining</span><span>  few  yards.  Callanan  secured  the  other</span><span>  points,  making  the  score  27-6.</span><span>  Beaudebert  was  now  in  full  charge.</span><span>  McGovern  and  Wellington  handled</span><span>  within  striking  distance,  but  they  could</span><span>  not  finish  off.  Then  South  Coast  kick</span><span>  ed  clear,  and  S.  Callanan  was  unable</span><span>  to  see  the  ball.  He  shielded  his  eyes</span><span>  from  the  sun,  b.ut  missed.  Smith  saved</span><span>  the  situation  when  Napper  had  only</span><span>  him  to  pass.  It  was  temporary  re</span><span>  spite  because  Ray  Collins  charged  over</span><span>  from  a  ruck.  Wintle  missed,  making</span><span>  the  final  score  Beaudesert  27.  South</span><span>  Coast  9.</span><span>  '  Beaudescrt's  reserve  team  won  its</span><span>  first  match  of  the  season.  The</span><span>  league  started  badly  by  playing  a</span><span>  junior  team,  as  laid  down  by  the</span><span>  combined  leagues,  but  apparently</span><span>  Beaudesert  was  the  only  league  to</span><span>  abide  by  the  rules.</span><span>  Beaudesert  fielded  its  .strongest  sec</span><span>  ond  team  on  Sunday,  and  it  made  a</span><span>  good  fist  of  it,  although  the  forwards</span><span>  showed  that  they  were  lacking  in  con</span><span>  dition  when  it  came  to  open  play.  Had</span><span>  a  similar  side  been  brought  together</span><span>  earlier  Beaudesert  would  not  have  been</span><span>  at  the  bottom  of  the  list.</span></p> <p><span>  The  teams  were'</span><span>  South  Coast:  Fuilback,  J.

Draper,  T.  Alclridge,  K.  Little.</span><span>  Beaudesert  should  have  scored  in  the</span><span>  early  stages,  but  it  seemed  that  a</span><span>  number  of  players  wanted  the  honour,</span><span>  and  they  hung  on  instead  of  passing</span><span>  out,  leaving  the  home  side  backs  In  the</span><span>  clear.  Finally  Barrett  went  over.</span><span>  Beaudesevt  was  on  the  job  immed</span><span>  iately.  but  could  not  finish  off  its  move</span><span>  ments.  After  loose  play  on  the  line</span><span>  South  Coast  passed  the  ball  back  over</span><span>  its  line  and  a  player  kicked  It.  Sykes</span><span>  who  followed  on  fast  took  the  ball  after</span><span>  it  had  travelled  only  several  yards,  and</span><span>  he  dropped  on  it  to  score,  the  result  of</span><span>  keeping  on  the  game.  The  kick  missed,</span><span>  and  Beaudesert  led  6-0.</span><span>  Two  minutes  later  and  the  visitors</span><span>  scored  from  a  passing  movement.

"<p><span>  Beaudesert  Band  to  Become</span><span>  Effective</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Beaudesert  Band,  which  has  been  In  recess  since  1941,  will</span><span>  become  effective  shortly,  according  to  information  given  a  public</span><span>  meeting  on  Monday  night.</span><span>  The  meeting  was  held,  following  a  discussion,  at  a  Beaudesert</span></p> <p><span>  Chamber  of  Commerce  meeting  several  months-  ago,  with  a  view  to</span><span>  stimulating  interest  in  the  band  and  choral  movement-</span><span>  Bandsmen  indicated  that  all  was  well  with  their  organisation,  but</span><span>  although  there  were  offers  of  assistance  for  a  choir  the  matter  of</span><span>  forming  a  society  to  control  it  was  deferred  for  the  time  being.</span></p> <p><span>  Henvy  rain  had  fallen  throughout</span><span>  the  day,  and,  although  the  night  was</span><span>  clear,  there  had  been  indications  that</span><span>  there  would  be  further  showers.  This</span><span>  no  doubt  prevented  many  Interested</span><span>  people  from  attending.</span><span>  Mr.  A.  Hood,  who  had  called  the</span><span>  meeting  at  the  request  of  the  Chamber</span><span>  of  Commerce,  explained  to  those  pre</span><span>  sent  that  he  had  the  Idea  of  trying  to</span><span>  Induce  a  capable  musician  to  come  to</span><span>  Beaudesert  to  take  charge  of  the  band</span><span>  and  choir.  -A  capable  man  could  con</span><span>  duct  both  the  band  and  choir.</span><span>  Mr.  L.  J.  McFadden  drew  attention</span><span>  to  the  difficulty  of  getting  a  house  for</span><span>  anybody  coming  to  the  town.</span><span>  Mr.  Hood  said  that  he  had  thought</span><span>  of  that.  If  they  could  get  a  suitable</span><span>  man  they  could  pay  him  a  subsidy.</span><span>  The  band  could  practice  on  one  night,</span><span>  the  choir  another  night,  and  the  con</span><span>  ductor  would  be  free  to  take  private</span><span>  pupils.  They  could  make  inquiries  and</span><span>  find  him  a  suitable  position.</span><span>  Mr.  McFadden  said  that  as  far  as</span><span>  the  band  was  concerned  It  was  just  a</span><span>  matter  of  starting  It  off.  They  should</span><span>  have  a  choral  society  as  well.</span><span>  Both  Messrs.  Dauth  and  McFadden</span><span>  explained  that  the  band  was  not  de</span><span>  funct.  It  only  went  into  recess  during</span><span>  the  war  years  because  It  had  insuffi</span><span>  cient  players.</span><span>  Mr.  A.  Huffey  said  they  should  en</span><span>  deavour  to  form  an  orchestra  for  the</span><span>  town.  He  would  give  any  assistance</span><span>  he  could.</span><span>  Mr.  Hood  said  that  Beaudesert  was</span><span>  big  enough  to  support  a  band.</span><span>  Mr.  McFadden  said  that  the  band</span><span>  had  a  full  set  of  instruments  and  uni</span><span>  forms.</span><span>  Mr.  R.  Houston  said  that  it  seemed</span><span>  that  it  required  a  decision  to  start  the</span><span>  band  moving.</span><span>  Mr.  Dauth  said  that  the  band  func</span><span>  tioned  until  members  went  away.  The</span><span>  last  of  the  members  had  returned,  and</span><span>  he  thought  all  the  former  players  would</span><span>  be  prepared  to  start  off  again.  They</span><span>  had  a  committee  and  it  was  properly  .</span><span>  constituted.</span><span>  Mr.  Houston  said  that  In  view  of  the</span><span>  information  given  the  meeting  they</span><span>  were  not  In  order  going  on  with  the</span><span>  matter.</span><span>  Mr.  Hood  referred  to  the  fact  that</span><span>  the  band  had  not  a  great  membership,</span><span>  and  that  if  they  secured  the  services</span><span>  of  a  good  conductor  they  could  raise</span><span>  the  standard.</span><span>  Mr.  Dauth  said  that  the  band  re</span><span>  ceived  poor  support  from  the  public</span><span>  in  the  past.  It  relied  on  the  collection</span><span>  box  taken  around  at  public  appear</span><span>  ances.  He  did  not  know  if  the  band</span><span>  was  appreciated.</span><span>  Mr.  Hood  suggested  that  the  pro</span><span>  grammes  could  be  made  more  attrac</span><span>  tive  if  they  included  vocal  numbers  in</span><span>  the  programme.</span><span>  Mr.  Dauth  said  that  he  thought  they</span><span>  would  get  assistance  for  the  choral</span><span>  movement  from  bandsmen.</span><span>  Mr.  Hood  said  that  while  there  were</span><span>  no  prospective  choir  members  present</span><span>  several  ladles  rang  to  say  they  were</span><span>  behind  the  move.  Ministers  of  religion</span><span>  at  Beaudesert  also  expressed  interest.</span><span>  He  was  sorry  that  they  were  not  pre</span><span>  sent,  but  it  was  a  bad  night.</span><span>  Mr.  McFadden:  The  band  is  well  set</span><span>  up.  It  Is  only  a  matter  of  deciding</span><span>  when  it  will  start.</span><span>  Mr.  Dauth;  We  have  £4  In  the  bank.</span></p> <p><span>  When  Mr.  Houston  asked  If  the</span><span>  meeting  could  request  the  band  to</span><span>  start  off,  Mr.  McFadden  said  that  they</span><span>  could  get  12  players  without  any</span><span>  .trouble.  The  highest  number  they  had</span><span>  had  in  the  past  was  15.</span><span>  Mr.  Dauth:  We  have  had  up  to  18</span><span>  players.  The  band  went  to  the  Bunda-</span><span>  berg  contest  In  1920.  '  It  included  some</span><span>  Beenleigh  players.</span><span>  Mr.  McFadden  -  said  that  the  band</span><span>  had  been  asked  to  play  on  Anzac  Day,</span><span>  and  it  looked  as  if  they  could  accede</span><span>  to  the  request.</span><span>  Mr.  Hood:  Let  us  try  and  get  the</span><span>  public  behind  the  band.</span><span>  Mr.  Dauth:  We  received  poor  public</span><span>  support.  Bandsmen  received  nothing</span><span>  out  of  the  band,  but  played  for  the</span><span>  love  of  music.  The  band  asked  for  the</span><span>  support  of  the  Council  but  did  not  re</span><span>  ceive  a  subsidy.  There  were  several</span><span>  donations.</span><span>  Mr.  Dauth  suggested  that  they  leave</span><span>  the  meeting  stand  in  abeyance  and  the</span><span>  band  call  a  meeting  to  see  how  it</span><span>  shaped.  Then  they  could  endeavour  to-</span><span>  start  the  choir.  The  band  would  assist</span><span>  as  much  as  possible.  The  attendance</span><span>  that  night  was  not  a  fair  test  of  public</span><span>  interest.</span><span>  .  Mr.  Houston  said  since  the  Cham</span><span>  ber  had  discussed  a  suggestion  that</span><span>  efforts  be  made  to  cater  for  young</span><span>  ,  players,  four  fathers  had  spoken  to</span><span>  him.  TTiey  were  keen  to  have  their</span><span>  sons  learn  to  play  an-  instrument.  He</span><span>  thought  they  should  recommend  to</span><span>  the  band  that  something  of  that  na</span><span>  ture  be  done.</span><span>  Mr.  McFadden  said  that  the  band</span><span>  had  always  encouraged  young  players.</span><span>  They  were  invited  to  attend,  and  mem</span><span>  bers  gave  them  all  the  help  they  could.</span><span>  It  was  agreed  that  boys  should  have</span><span>  a  tutor  to.  teach  them  the  rudiments  of</span><span>  music  before  they-,  went  to  the  band-</span><span>  room.  It  was  felt  :  that  it  was  too  big</span><span>  a  handicap  to  teach  a  boy  music  when</span><span>  the  band  was  practising.</span><span>  Mr.  McFadden  said  bis  Idea  was  to</span><span>  foster  a  band  at  the  school.  They  had</span><span>  some  old  instruments  that  could  be</span><span>  used  if  they  had  somebody  to  teach</span><span>  the  boys,</span><span>  Mr.  Hood  said  that  he  thought  the</span><span>  meeting  that  night  had  not  been</span><span>  called  before  time.</span><span>  Mr.  Houston:  It  is  up  to  the  public</span><span>  to  sponsor  the  movement,  and  not.  leave</span><span>  it,  t6  the  band.  It  seemed  that  there</span><span>  .  was  a  lack  of  finance  in  the  past.  The</span><span>  public  benefited  by  having  a  band,  and</span><span>  he  could  not  see  why  they  could  not</span><span>  raise  sufficient  finance  for  the  pur</span><span>  pose.  A  band  was  an  acquisition  to  the</span><span>  town,  and  concerts  on  a  summer's  night</span><span>  were  an  education.</span><span>  Mr.  Hood:  It  Is  up  to  the  Council</span><span>  jand  other  bodies  to  get  behind  the</span><span>  ''band.  It  Is  possible  to  get  players  If</span><span>  you  can  get  them  a  job.</span><span>  Distancing  the  lack  of  encourage</span><span>  ment  given  the  band,  Mr.  Dauth  said</span><span>  p  that  on  one  occasion  the  Show  So</span><span>  ciety  brought  a  band  from  Ipswich,</span><span>  ;  and  paid  It  £60  to  play  at  the  camp</span><span>  !  draft.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Hood  said  that  there  was  noth-</span><span>  !  tog  much  for  growing  boys  to  do  at</span><span>  Beaudesert  but  knock  about  the  town.</span><span>  :  It  was  decided  that  the  band  hold.</span><span>  '  its  annual  meeting  on  Monday  night.</span><span>  Mr.  Hood  said  that  Beaudesert  had</span><span>  .  the  voices  but  nobody  to  bring  them</span><span>  '  out.  .  They  could  get  a  nicely  balanced</span><span>  .  choir.  He  had  heard  five  or  six  good</span><span>  voices  at  the  bowling  club,  but  the</span><span>  members  concerned  did  not  realise  that</span><span>  1  they  had  good  voices.</span><span>  1  The  matter  of  forming  a  choir  was</span><span>  deferred  for  the  time  bring.</span></p> <p><span>  Miss  Pauline  Pehrson,  who  has  been</span><span>  on  the  staff  of  -the  school  since  last</span><span>  August  has  been  appointed  head</span><span>  teacher  of  the  State  School  at  Wooren-</span><span>  den,  near  Murgon,  and  left  for  that</span><span>  centre  on  Wednesday.  So  far  it  is  not</span><span>  known  whether  Miss  Pehrson  will  be</span><span>  replaced.</span><span>  For  a  considerable  time  Mr.  H.  V.</span><span>  Lahey  has  been  sending  some  splendid</span><span>  magazines  which  have  been  of  great</span><span>  use  to  the  school.  He  has  now  arranged</span><span>  for  the  school  to  receive  every  month</span><span>  from  America  a  copy  of  the  National</span><span>  Geographic  Magazine.  The  school  is</span><span>  very  grateful  to  Mr.  Lahey  for  his  gen</span><span>  erous  action.</span><span>  Thanks  are  also  expressed  to  Mr.  G.</span><span>  Tranter  for.-mi.king  a  truck  available</span><span>  to  transport  the  children  to  the  river</span><span>  for  swimming  lessons.

He</span><span>  said  that  the  wholesale  company  pur</span><span>  chasing  their  milk  and  the  Milk  Board</span><span>  had  put  up  a  better  fight  than  ever  to</span><span>  maintain  quotas.  When  the  question</span><span>  of  Norco,  and  its  supply  of  a  thousand</span><span>  gallons,  came  up  he  asked  how  many</span><span>  members  were  prepared  to  guarantee</span><span>  to  supply  Norco's  quota.  They  had  to</span><span>  be  prepared  to  maintain  a  level  that</span><span>  would  supply  the  market  all  the  year</span><span>  round.  He  contended  that  if  they</span><span>  were  going  to  maintain  production  the</span><span>  Eoard  should  leave  the  quota  months</span><span>  alone.  '</span><span>  Mr.  Kenny  said  that  they  were  going</span><span>  to  receive  1/8  a  gallon  this  winter.  The</span><span>  Council  was  of  the  opinion  that  the</span><span>  milk  was  still  worth  1/  111.  The.  Federal</span><span>  Council  was  putting  up  a  fight  to  get</span><span>  1/10.  '  '  ""</span><span>  ""I  would  like  to  -warn  you  regard</span><span>  ing  the  concentrates  position""  added</span><span>  Mr.  Kenny.  ""Concentrates  are  going</span><span>  to  be  short,  and  wheat  is  going  to</span><span>  be  shipped  to  England.  I  am  passing</span><span>  this  on  to  you  so  that  you  will  not</span><span>  wait  until  July  and  August  to  pur</span><span>  chase  your  supplies.""</span><span>  Mr.  Harrison  said  that  he  did  not</span><span>  think  the  milk  position  would  be  any</span><span>  different  this  winter  to  that  of  last</span></p> <p><span>  winter.  He  thought  more  milk  would</span><span>  be  required  on  the  Brisbane  market.</span><span>  During  the  last  few  years  they  had  to</span><span>  draw  on  supplies  from  outside  areas.</span><span>  There  was  a  temporary  arrangement</span><span>  with  Warwick  last  year,  Toowoomba</span><span>  factory,  and  its  district  was  about  the</span><span>  biggest  supplier.  Autumn  of  last  year</span><span>  was  a  difficult  period,  and  milk  was</span><span>  short.</span><span>  Mr.  Harrison  said  he  wanted  Beau</span><span>  desert  to  be  in  a  position  to  answer</span><span>  the/call  if  Br'sbane  wanted  extra  milk.</span><span>  Last  year  Toowoomua  i.i.isced  on  a</span><span>  quota,  and  received  1:.  Nobody  would</span><span>  come  and  force  the  dairymen  to  supply</span><span>  milk  to  Brisbane,  and  it  was  a-  case  of</span><span>  them  being  prepared,  and  able  to  advise</span><span>  Brisbane  that  the  district  was  organ</span><span>  ised  to  meet  the  demand.</span><span>  Mr.  Harrison  said  that  often  react</span><span>  ion  followed  a  good  season.  Farmers</span><span>  had  not  been  able  to  plant  much  feed</span><span>  and  the  concentrates  position  might  be</span><span>  difficult.  There  was  a  tremendous</span><span>  opening  for  the  milk  trade  in  the  dis</span><span>  trict.  About  a  fourth  of  the  dairymen</span><span>  supplied  milk.</span><span>  ""I  think  the  district  is  getting  more</span><span>  milk  minded  and  I  think  it  is  better</span><span>  for  the  district.  You  will  have  to</span><span>  organise  extra  runs,  and  see  if  the</span><span>  factory  wlU  be  able  to  handle  the</span><span>  extra  milk  if  you  want  to  go  for  the</span><span>  extra  trade,""  said  Mr.  Harrison.  ""The</span><span>  increase  will  be  gradual.  I  think,  if</span><span>  anything,  the  wholesaler  in  Brisbane</span><span>  we  supply  prefers  milk  from  the</span><span>  Downs.  .  Last  year  they  asked  if  Beau,</span><span>  desert  could  supply  extra  milk  im-</span><span>  'mediately,  .but  this  was  impossible.</span><span>  They  said  ihey  wanted  the  milk  and</span><span>  they  had  to  go  to  Toowoomba  for  it.""</span><span>  Mr.  Harrison  forecast  an  increased</span><span>  demand  on  the  Brisbane  market.  He</span><span>  said  he  hoped  that  it  was  not  restricted</span><span>  to  milk.  The  regulations  governing  the</span><span>  control  of  fresh  cream  were  not  going</span><span>  to  last  for  ever,  and  he  looked  to  the</span><span>  time  when  the  fresh  cream  trade  would</span><span>  be  an  adjunct  to  the  milk  trade.  Bris</span><span>  bane  would  provide  a  profitable  market,</span><span>  Mr.  Wilshire,  when  asked  if  the  fac</span><span>  tory  could'handle  more  milk,  said  that</span><span>  when  the  flood  was  on,  and  the  sup</span><span>  pliers  could  not  get  their  milk,  to  Bris-</span><span>  bane,  the  factory,  without  turning  a</span><span>  hair,  handled  the  milk.  He  was  not</span><span>  going  to  say  that  it  did  not  create  dls-</span><span>  -  organisation.  It  meant  overtime  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  staff,  but  they  coped  with  the</span><span>  position.  When  tiley  had  the  new  milk</span><span>  machine  in  opera|tjpn  the  factory  would</span><span>  be  able  to  hanftfe/?,fne  extra  supply.</span><span>  Mr.  Wilshire  ,'said?that  before  an  ap</span><span>  proach  was  maH6j.to  Toowoomba  last</span><span>  year  he  advised,'  Vtheit  he  had  two  runs</span><span>  ready  to  go  interfile  milk  trade.  The</span><span>  next  thing  he  heftrjd  was  that  Brisbane</span><span>  wholesaler  had  goh|  to  Toowoomba  for</span><span>  the  milk.  He''urfd6rstood  two  runs  were</span><span>  ready  to  changeover  and  there  were</span><span>  others  who  migi)fjbe  prepared  to  do</span><span>  the  same  thing:-</span><span>  Mr.  Hudson  suggested  appointing  a</span><span>  subcommittee'  tl/twork  out  a  scheme</span><span>  and  report  to  a  .father  meeting.  They</span><span>  were  closer  to.  the;,  market  and  had  a</span><span>  shorter  haul  than'jToowoomba.

There  was</span><span>  no  intention  to  ""finalise  the  cream</span><span>  producer.  """"""""--X'  i</span><span>  Mr.  G.  Masen  said  the  milk  was</span><span>  available  in  the  district.  I</span><span>  Mr.  Wilshire  said  that  the  factory</span><span>  had  dual  carriers.  They  were  against</span><span>  forcing  a  man  from  cream  to  milk  pro</span><span>  duction.</span><span>  Mr.  Harrison  said  he  hoped  that  no</span><span>  body  thought  the  proposal  was  an  in</span><span>  vitation  to  start  supplying  milk  im</span><span>  mediately.  Milk  supplies  would  de</span><span>  crease  in  April,  and  the  decrease  would</span><span>  be  gradual.  That  meant  they  would</span><span>  call  for  additional  milk  to  supplement</span><span>  the  supply.  Indications  of  the  position</span><span>  would  come  from  the  wholesaler,  who</span><span>  would  go  to  the  Milk  Board.  Any  new</span><span>  suppliers  would  be  protected  regarding</span><span>  quotas  under  the  Milk  Act.  They</span><span>  would  only  take  on  new  suppliers  cau</span><span>  tiously.  V</span><span>  Mr.  Kenny  said  that  they  wanted  to</span><span>  leave  individual  suppliers  alone  for  the</span><span>  present,  but  new  suppliers  would  go</span><span>  through  the  factory.</span><span>  The  following  were  appointed  a  sub</span><span>  committee:  Messrs.  Lewis  (Tam-</span><span>  rookum),  Masen  (Rathdowney),  Mur</span><span>  phy  (Innisplains),  Hugh  Campbell</span><span>  (Christmas  Creek),  T.

He  thought  the  directors  of</span><span>  the  factory  were  getting  more  milk</span><span>  minded  than  they  were.  The  factory</span><span>  should  be  in  a  position  to  advise  the</span><span>  Milk  Board  of  the  position  if  it</span><span>  asked  for  more  milk,  and  then  moke</span><span>  the  necessary  arrangements  to  handle</span><span>  the  milk.</span><span>  It  was  decided  to  have  all  informa</span><span>  tion  collected  for  a  meeting  of  the</span><span>  committees  in  the  first  week  In  April.</span></p> ",Article,1946-03-15,Brisbane Milk Bid by Beaudesert Producers,216082898,1,1,"{'score': '1707.3479', 'value': 'very relevant'}","MILK producers in the Beaudesert district are to make a determined bi[?] to capture a greater portion of the Brisbane milk market during the coming winter, and, with this in","{'id': '1064', 'value': 'The Beaudesert Times (Qld. : 1908 - 1954)'}",https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/216082898?searchTerm=%27The+Beaudesert+Times%27,/newspaper/216082898,The Beaudesert Times (Qld. : 1908 - 1954),1064

Davies  (Cairns),  R.</span><span>  Thornley,  G,  Cecil,  C.  King  (Cairns</span><span>  Masonic),  B.  Bevis,  H.  B.  Moran  (Innis</span><span>  fail),  A.  Whitechurch,  J.  Jackson</span><span>  and  Watson  (Babinda).</span><span>  The  visitors,  who  were  conveyed  by-</span><span>  specially  chartered  bus,  travelled  from</span><span>  Warwick  on  Monday  morning.  They</span><span>  were  entertained  to  lunch  in  the  ball</span><span>  room  at  the  Grand  Hotel.</span><span>  The  match  was  played  during  the</span><span>  afternoon,  and  ai  night  an  impromptu</span><span>  smoke,  social  wit?  held.  It  had  been</span><span>  anticipated  that  the  visitors  would  be</span><span>  proceeding  to  Southport  after  the  gnmo</span><span>  but  there  was  a  change  in  plans,  and</span><span>  they  remained  at.  Beaudesert  overnight,</span><span>  leaving  on  Tuesday  morning.</span><span>  The  evening  function  was  a  happy</span><span>  affair.  Mr.  L.  Barnes  entertained  with</span><span>  conjuring  tricks,  and  outstanding  en</span><span>  tertainers  in  the  visitors  was  Messrs.</span><span>  H.  B.  Moran  (Innisfail)  and  C.  Cecil</span><span>  (Cairns).</span><span>  At  the  tea  adjournment  the  President</span><span>  (Mr.  F.  Hodgson)  said  that  it  was  the</span><span>  first  occasion  that  they  had  heen  able</span><span>  to  welcome  Far  Northern  bowlers  to</span><span>  their  green,  and  the  members  hoped</span><span>  the  visitors  enjoyed  themselves.  When</span><span>  they  received  word  of  the  visit  it  was</span><span>  doubtful  whether  they  could  arrange</span><span>  the  match,  because  Monday  was  Beau-</span><span>  desert's  busiest  day.</span><span>  Then  they  received  an  urgent  mes-.</span><span>  sage  asking  what  they  intended  to  do</span><span>  because  the  team  would  proceed  to</span><span>  a  Stanthorpe,  if  Beaudesert  could  not</span><span>  accommodate  it.  They  set  out  to  se</span><span>  cure  18  players,  but  instead  found  they</span><span>  had  24  names.  He  did  not  mind  telling</span><span>  the  visitors  that  most  of  the  men  were</span><span>  A.W.L.,  but  there  was  no  need  to  say</span><span>  anything  .about  it  unless  businessmen</span><span>  visited  the  green  to  see  where  their</span><span>  employees  were.</span><span>  The  speaker  'said  that  the  Manager</span><span>  (Mr.  A.  E.  Symons)  had  been  stationed</span><span>  at  Jimboomba  during  the  war  years.</span><span>  They  were  indebted  to  him  for  provid-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  the  brigade  band  for  a  President's</span><span>  At  Home,  and  fqr  an  entertainment</span><span>  provided  for  Beaudesert.  The  artists</span><span>  were  all  professionals  and  the  people</span><span>  would  long  remember  those  occasions.</span><span>  Unfortunately  Colonel  Symons,  as  he</span><span>  was  then,  had  been;  Involved  in  a  motor</span><span>  accident  and  he  was  unable  to  return</span><span>  to  Beaudesert.</span><span>  Referring  to  northerners  Mr.  Hodg</span><span>  son  said  that  they  were  great  British</span><span>  ers  and  great  hearted  people.  They</span><span>  made  visitors  welcome  and  gave  them</span><span>  a  good  time.  He'  spent  some  months</span><span>  at  Innisfail  and  he  never  regretted  the</span><span>  first  day  he  went  to  the  Innisfail  bowl</span><span>  ing  green.</span><span>  Mr.  L.  Barnes  said  the  hospitality  of</span><span>  N.Q.  was  well  known,  and  Beaudesert</span><span>  hoped  to  extend  the  same  hospitality</span><span>  to  the  visitors.  He  said  tours  of  sport</span><span>  ing  bodies  were  in  'the  interests  of  the</span><span>  nation.  It  brought  'people  together  in</span><span>  the  sporting  world,  and  made  them</span><span>  realise  the  north  was  not  so  far  away</span><span>  after  all.</span><span>  Dr.  Beet  said  he  hoped  the  visitors</span><span>  would  enjoy  their  game.</span><span>  Mr.  Hodgson  thanked  the  ladies  who</span><span>  were  responsible  for  afternoon  tea.  He</span><span>  said  he  did  not  know  Mrs.  S.  Dauth</span><span>  would  be  present,  but  her  visit  showed</span><span>  her  interest  in  the  club.  They  could</span><span>  '  see-  her  interest  in  the  game  by  the</span><span>  number  of  times  her  name  appeared</span><span>  on  the  club  championship  boards.  They</span><span>  thanked  Mesdames  Dauth,  Jurd  and</span><span>  Armstrong  for  assisting  with  the  re</span><span>  freshments.</span><span>  Mr.  Watson,  vice  president  of  the</span><span>  F.N.Q.D.B.A.,  in  responding,  said  that</span><span>  the  cordiality  of  the  welcome  was  going</span><span>  to  take  some  beating  by  other  clubs.</span><span>  The  little  they  had  seen  of  the  town</span><span>  they  had  liked  very  much.  He  had  been</span><span>  told  it  .was  one  of  the  most  solid  towns</span><span>  in  Queensland.  The  members  of  the</span><span>  team  had  had  a  glorious  trip  to  date.</span><span>  Mr.  Symons,  who  organised  the  trip,</span><span>  said  that  he  was  pleased  to  come  back</span><span>  to  his  old  haunts.  He  appreciated  the</span><span>  kindness  of  the  Beaudesert  people  to</span><span>  the  troops  while  stationed  in  the  d's-</span><span>  trict.  He  tried  to  get  the  troops  to  play</span><span>  the  .game  in  appreciation,  and  he</span><span>  thought  they  did.</span><span>  Mr.  Symons  said  that  in  organising</span><span>  the  tour  he  spoke  to  Mr/  Barnes.  Beau</span><span>  desert  appeared  to  always  be  left  out</span><span>  of  tours  and  it  provided  a  break  in  the</span><span>  journey.  On  the  tour  they  would  have</span><span>  played  all  associations.  He  was  pleased</span><span>  to  see  Mr.  M.  T.  Sullivan  present,  and</span><span>  he  had  happy  recollections  of  the  Pre</span><span>  sident's  Day  referred  to.  It  was  a  mar</span><span>  vellous  afternoon.  To  date  everything</span><span>  had""  gone  well.  He  also  thanked  the</span><span>  ladies  for  their  afternoon  tea.</span><span>  Mr.  Watson  then  presented  the  club</span><span>  with  a  pennant,  which  had  been  struck</span><span>  for  the  trip,  and  presented  Mrs.  Dauth,</span><span>  Messrs.  Hodgson  and  A.

An  Imjjpyement  in</span><span>  the  funds  of  the  Club  will  be  appreciated  because  a'.rod  deal  of</span><span>  money  will  be  required  to  provide  the  necessary  fa  (Whiles  at  the</span><span>  course.</span><span>  It  Is  a  tribute  to  the  organising  ability  of  the  oloi>  that  there</span><span>  .  should  be  such  a  big  crowd  at  the  meeting,  and  this  reflects  credit</span><span>  on  the  members  of  the  committee  for  the  part  that  they""  Jiave  played.</span><span>  While  it  might  be  admitted  that  the  attendance  included  only  a</span><span>  small  percentage  of  district  residents  the  meeting,  andiothers  of  its</span><span>  kin,  has  done  much  to  advertise  the  district,  and  improve  the  busi</span><span>  ness  turnover  of  Beaudesert.</span></p> <p><span>  When  heavy  rain  fell  at  the  week</span><span>  end  it  'was  feared  that  the  meeting</span><span>  might  have  to  be  abandoned.  The  track</span><span>  suffered  as  a  result  of  the  flooding,  but</span><span>  by  Wednesday  morning  it  was  lh  per</span><span>  fect  condition,  testifying  to  the  fact</span><span>  that  drainage  already  carried  out  is  a</span><span>  step  in  the  right  direction.</span><span>  So  many  people  attended  that  the</span><span>  present  facilities  were  shown  to  be  In</span><span>  adequate.  Of  course  the  club  can  not</span><span>  be  condemned  for  this  because  after</span><span>  the  outbreak  of  war  its  funds  were  de</span><span>  voted  to  patriotic  purposes.  Then  fol</span><span>  lowed  some  abandoned  meetings  be</span><span>  cause  of  wet  weather,  and  a  debit  bal</span><span>  ance  of  hundreds  of  pounds  was  soon</span><span>  shown.  Then  '  further  meetings  were  '</span><span>  held  but  the  percentage  the  club  re</span><span>  ceived  was  used  in  paying  off  debit</span><span>  balances,  and  improving  the  track.</span><span>  Now  that  conditions  have  improved</span><span>  it  is  hoped  that  the  club  will  be  able</span><span>  to  consider  improving  its  buildings.  In</span><span>  the  meantime  its  officials  can  acquaint</span><span>  the  committee  of  small  matters  that</span><span>  can  be  attended  to.  The  club  already</span><span>  has  meetings  allocated  for  February  6</span><span>  and  March  6.</span><span>  Officials  had  a  busy  time  and  al</span><span>  though  there  was  some  confusion  at</span><span>  times  it  must  be  admitted  that  a  grand</span><span>  job  was  done  by  all.  It  was  inevitable</span><span>  that  mistakes  would  be  made,  but  with</span><span>  the  experience  gained  there  should  be</span><span>  an  improvement  in  the  future.  Mis</span><span>  takes  and  congestions  destroy  public</span><span>  confidence,  and  nobody  realised  this</span><span>  more  than  those  charged  with  such  a</span><span>  big  task  as  faced  officials  on  Wednes</span><span>  day.

Elleray.</span><span>  The  first  race  was  got  away  to  time</span><span>  after  a  false  start  had  caused  a  slight</span><span>  delay.  Tom  Pepper  won  easily  by  half</span><span>  a  length.  Opening  at  7  to  4  the  win</span><span>  ner  was  solidly  supported  to  start  at  5</span><span>  to  4  on.  After  passing  the  post,  Mon</span><span>  Lad  swung  out,  and  althugh  Jockey</span><span>  Morsillo  made  a  good  effort  to  retain</span><span>  his  seat,  he  failed  to  do  so.  His  fall</span><span>  was  not  severe  as  his  mount  had  prac</span><span>  tically  stopped.  The  horse  escaped  from</span><span>  the  enclosure,  and  this  delayed  the</span><span>  posting  of  ""weight.""</span><span>  Those  who  invested  small  amounts</span><span>  on  Malliby  got  a  thrill  when  that</span><span>  horse  broke  away  from  the  start  of</span><span>  the  Second  Division  Hack,  and  opened</span><span>  a  gap  of  three  lengths  from  a  bunched</span><span>  field.  However,  the  even  money  top-</span></p> <p><span>  weight,  Newslot,  had  everything  re</span><span>  quired,  and,  in  a  stirring  finish  In</span><span>  which  any  one  of  four  horses  might</span><span>  have  won  got  (.he  decision  by  a  head,</span><span>  with  Visor  a  head  worse,  arid  Malliby</span><span>  third  a  neck  away.  Many  claimed  t)mt</span><span>  Miss  Bru,  on  the  fence,  might  have</span><span>  been  in  a  place.  Newslot  was  never</span><span>  better  '  than,  evens,  while  Visor  short</span><span>  ened  from  eights'  tp  fours,</span><span>  Punters  and  bookmakers  agreed  that</span><span>  nothing  had  a  chance  for  the  Third</span><span>  PivlsioB  of  6  furlongs,  other  than</span><span>  Graceful  Lad.  Early  takers  soon</span><span>  scooped  up  the  7/4  on,  and  late  ar</span><span>  rivals  had  nothing  but  twos  on  to  con</span><span>  sider.  Arubial  drifted  from  threes  to</span><span>  sevens  and  a  little  tens,  and  tens</span><span>  could  be  got  about  the  others,</span><span>  excepting  Field  Leader,  who  went</span><span>  out  at  fives.  Graceful  Lad  soon</span><span>  made  a  break,  but  England  stayed  with</span><span>  him  for  several  furlongs.  Field  Leader</span><span>  set  out,  but  had  no  chance,  and  was</span><span>  lueky  to  get  within  three  lengths  of-</span><span>  the  winner.</span><span>  The  fourth  race,  the  First  Division</span><span>  of  the  Maiden  Handicap,  went  to  the</span><span>  6  to  4  on  favourite,  Crimson  Chief,</span><span>  although  he  did  not  have  tilings  all  his</span><span>  own  way,  the  winning  margin  being-</span><span>  half  a  head.  Maverick'  held  the  leader</span><span>  until  they  swung  into  the  straight,  but</span><span>  he  could  not  beat  off  Lady's  First  who</span><span>  made  second  place.  Nothing  but  the</span><span>  winner  was  given  a  chahce  by  punters,</span><span>  but  there  was  a  little  money  for  some</span><span>  of  the  others.</span><span>  The  Second  Division  of  the  Maiden</span><span>  Handicap  was  a  good  betting  race,  Pir</span><span>  ate  Miss,  Gashfield,  and  Shining  silk</span><span>  all  being  supported.  In  the  early  stages</span><span>  fives  could  be  secured  about  Shining</span><span>  Sllk.  but  he  finished  up  equal  favour</span><span>  ite  with  Gashfield  at  5  to  2.  Gashfield</span></p> <p><span>  was  generally  called  at  twos  at  many</span><span>  stages.

Punters  wanted</span><span>  nothing  but  the  favourite,  and  Mine</span><span>  Sweeper  and  My  Wish,  both  of  whom</span><span>  were  quoted  at  fours.  Tens  to  twenties</span><span>  operated  about  the  remaining  ten  :</span><span>  starters.</span><span>  The  favourite,-/  Valagfred,  was</span><span>  downed  in  the  seventh  race,  the  Fifth</span><span>  Division  Handicap/  victory  going  to</span><span>  Visor  by  half  a  length  from  Tom  Pep</span><span>  per,  who  won  the  ""first  race.  Visor  had</span><span>  filled  second  place  m  his  earlier  start,</span></p> <p><span>  and,  although  those  who  got  in  early</span><span>  secured  fours  and  a  few  fives  about</span><span>  the  gelding's  chances,  there  was  so</span><span>  much  money  that  most  fielders  closed</span><span>  up  on  him,  arid  refused  to  get.  Tom</span><span>  Pepper  was  penalised  seven  pound  for</span><span>  his  win,  but  this  was  offset  by  an  al</span><span>  lowance  of  a  like  amount,  J.

Copies  of  all  correspondence  on</span><span>  the  matter  were  included.</span><span>  A  letter  from  the  Logan  and  Albert</span><span>  Co-operative  Dairy  Association  to  the</span><span>  Chamber  read:  Seeing  that  we  have</span><span>  already  made  application  for  an  in</span><span>  spector,  and  that  the  Queensland</span><span>  Dairymen's  Association  '  is  now  re</span><span>  garded  by  the  Government  as  the  rank</span><span>  and  file  representative  of  the  produc</span><span>  ers  my  Board  are  definitely  of  the</span><span>  opinion  that  your'  letter  should  be</span><span>  written  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Queens</span><span>  land  Dairymen's  Organisation  Board,</span><span>  who,  we  feel  surp-vvill  support  our  ap</span><span>  plication  for  a  di''  inspector,  and  not</span></p> <p><span>  a  combined  stock  inspector  and  dairy</span><span>  ing  inspector  as  at  present.</span><span>  The  Chamber  also  advised  writing  to</span><span>  the  Under  Secretary  of  the  Department</span><span>  of  Agriculture  and  Stock  in  the  matter.</span><span>  The  chairman  said  the  subject  was</span><span>  a  primary  producers  problem,  and  he</span><span>  thought  the  Chamber  had  exceeded  its</span><span>  powers.</span><span>  Voice:  Definitely.</span><span>  Chairman:  It  is  a  matter  for  the</span><span>  dairymen.</span><span>  Mr.  J.  E.  Markwell:  We  took  the</span><span>  matter  up  a  few  months  ago.</span><span>  Chairman:  What  we  want  is  not  just</span><span>  an  ordinary  dairy  inspector,  but  a  herd</span><span>  tester  and  an  agriculturalist  who  is  a</span><span>  practical  man.  .</span><span>  Mr.  E.  R.  Schwartz  said  he  was  glad</span><span>  that  the  chairman  had  objected  to  the</span><span>  way  the  Chamber  took  the  jiositlon  in</span><span>  hand.  His  own'  objection  was  to  the</span><span>  way  'the  Chamber  had  taken  it  in</span><span>  hand.  He  objected  to  the  way  the</span><span>  Chamber  handled  the  report,  and  he</span></p> <p><span>  was  upset  on  reacting  the  proceedings</span><span>  at  the  Chamber  meeting.</span><span>  Mr.  Schwartz  said  he  had  brought</span><span>  up  several  meetings  ago  that  they  had</span><span>  to  strive  for  quality,  but  there  was  no</span><span>  reason  to  say  that  the  quality  of  their</span><span>  product  was  worse  than  others.  If  men</span><span>  made  statements  regarding  the  quality</span><span>  of  the  milk,  compared  with  that  ""of</span><span>  other  areas,  they  should  consider  the</span><span>  industry,  and  make  inquiries  into  the</span><span>  matter  first.  If  the  Chamber  made</span><span>  the  accusation  that  they  produced  a</span><span>  bad  quality  milk  the  Q.D.O.  should  ask</span><span>  them  to  prove  .their  statements.  If  the</span></p> <p><span>  Chamber  did  they  must  show  the  qual</span><span>  ity  of  the  product  arriving  in  Brisbane</span><span>  compared  with  other  areas.  If  the</span><span>  Chamber  could  prove  the  quality  was</span><span>  inferior  they  should  go  to  the  Q.D.O.</span><span>  and  not  the  factory.</span><span>  Mr.  Schwartz  added  that  no  matter</span><span>  how  the  quality  of  the  milk  was  they</span><span>  should  strive  to  better  it.  What  were'</span><span>  the  duties  of  an  inspector?</span><span>  Chairman:  To  see  that  the  Govern</span><span>  ment  regulations  are  carried  out.</span><span>  Mr.  Schwartz  said  that  they  wanted</span><span>  a  tester.  The  butter  factor'y  meeting</span><span>  asked  for  a  tester,  but  he  doubted  if</span><span>  anything  had  happened.</span><span>  Chairman:  The  State  Executive  has</span><span>  applied  for  a  tester.</span><span>  Mr.  Schwartz  said  a  tester  served</span><span>  much  better  than  an  inspector.  The</span><span>  tester  visited  a  dairy  at  the  same  tune</span><span>  about  every  three  weeks,  and  the  in</span><span>  fluence  on  the  farmer  was  great.  Dairy</span><span>  farmers  might  get  .  a  little  slack  at</span><span>  times,  not  because  they  were  lazy,  but</span><span>  often  they  had  too  much  to  do,  and</span><span>  could  not  attend  to  the  little  things.  If</span><span>  a  tester  visited  the  farms  regularly  the</span><span>  producers  objective  would  be  to  have</span><span>  things  in  order.  The  visits  caused  a</span><span>  routine,  and  the  dairies  would  always</span><span>  be  in  order.</span><span>  The  speaker  contended  that  a</span><span>  tester  was  a  better  proposition  than</span><span>  an  inspector  because  he  could  give</span></p> <p><span>  --'-aav»ce;sHe  was  at  the  dairy  during</span><span>  the  milking  and  he  saw  the  milk</span><span>  ing.  The  dairy  inspector  only  looked</span><span>  for  the  yard  broom  and  shovel  etc.</span><span>  They  should  write  the  Chamber</span><span>  stating  that  in  a  way  they  appre</span><span>  ciated  the  suggestion,  but  also  ob</span><span>  jecting  to  the  criticism  of  their  pro</span><span>  duct,  if  the  Chamber  had  no  know</span><span>  ledge  of  the  comparison.  They</span><span>  should  also  inquire  from  the  factory</span><span>  as  to  the  decision  to  apply  for  a</span></p> <p><span>  tester.</span><span>  Mr.  G.  Mason  complained  that  when</span><span>  a  dairy  inspector  was  appointed  on  one</span><span>  previous  occasion  the  Government  had</span><span>  not  selected  a  practical  man.</span><span>  Mr.  J.  E.  Markwell  said  that  any</span><span>  subject  brought  up  had  been  dealt</span><span>  with.  They  had  been  dealing  with  the</span><span>  matter  for  twelve  months.</span><span>  Chairman:  Two  years.</span><span>  Mr.  Markwell:  We  have  been  dealing</span><span>  with  the  question  of  a  man  who  has</span><span>  passed  all  Ills  tests.  The  tester  'has  been</span><span>  promised  to  us.</span><span>  The  chairman  said  that  if  they  asked</span><span>  for  a  price  fixing  inspector  to  be</span><span>  brought  to  the  district  the  Chamber</span><span>  would  not  like  itr  If  half  the  producers</span><span>  learned  how  to  farm  they  would  know</span><span>  how  to  dairy.  They  needed  to  feed</span><span>  then-  stock.  The  Minister  for  Agricul</span><span>  ture  and  Stock  (Mr.  T.  Wijliams)  had</span><span>  assured  him  that  the  -  Government</span><span>  would  send  an  agriculturalist  and  tes</span><span>  ter  to  the  district.  They  could  not  force</span><span>  the  Government  to  send  the  man</span><span>  along.  If  the  Chamber  wrote  to  the</span><span>  Q.D.O.  it  would  get  ail  the  informa</span><span>  tion  it  required.</span><span>  Mr.  Mason:  The  rank  and  file  want</span><span>  a  man  who  can  advise  them  and  give</span><span>  them  suggestions  as  to  improving  their</span><span>  dairies  and  stock.  If  they  appointed</span><span>  a  man  they  would  have  to  get  one  with</span><span>  ability.  A  tester  would  be  of  assistance</span><span>  to  the  general  farmer.  His  idea  was</span><span>  that  the  factory  should  appoint  a  tes</span><span>  ter  and  the  farmers  pay  for  it.</span><span>  Following  a  statement  that  an  offi</span><span>  cial  appointed  in  the  past  was  not</span><span>  competent  the  chairman  and  secretary</span><span>  said  that  the  testers  they  had  dealt</span><span>  with  were  good  men.</span><span>  Mr.  J.  Moloney  said  that  the  Q.D.O.</span><span>  had  the  support  of  the  dairymen.  He</span><span>  did'  not  know  If  the  Chamber  had  the</span><span>  support  of  the  dairymen.</span><span>  Chairman  said  he  was  a  member</span><span>  and  he  thought  several  others  were.</span><span>  Mr,  Moloney:  The  Chamber  has  gone</span><span>  over  our-  heads.  We  are  capable  of</span><span>  handling  the  position.  We  don't  want</span><span>  any  slight.</span><span>  Replying  to  a  published  statement</span><span>  that  the  matter  would  have  to  go  be</span><span>  fore  branches  the  secretary  said  the</span><span>  matter  was  domestic  and  they  could</span><span>  handle  it  direct  with  the  Minister.</span><span>  Mr.  Schwartz  said  that  they  would</span><span>  have  to  get  a  tester  or  an  adviser.  The</span><span>  Government  could  not  send  out  better</span><span>  men  for  testing  than  it  was  doing.</span><span>  Chairman  moved  that  they  ask  the</span><span>  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Stock  to</span><span>  expedite  the  appointment  of  the  tester</span><span>  and  agriculturalist,  and  to  ask  the</span><span>  Chamber  to  refer  dairying  -questions  to</span><span>  the  Q.D.O.  and  its  requests  would  get</span><span>  prompt  attention.</span><span>  Seoretary  said  that  Mr.  Harrison</span><span>  (president)  ,  who  is  also  associated</span><span>  with  the  Milk  Board,  said  Beaudes</span><span>  ert  milk  compared  favourably</span><span>  with  that  sent  to  Brisbane  by  other</span><span>  districts,  and  Toowoomba  might  be</span><span>  a  little  better.</span><span>  Mr.  Moloney  pointed  out  that  Mr.</span><span>  Harrison  explained  that  other  dis</span><span>  tricts  were  having  trouble  with  the</span><span>  milk  at  the  same  time  that  Beau</span><span>  desert  was.</span><span>  Both  the  chairman  and  Mr.  O.  HayeJ</span><span>  said  that  they  personally  couid  not  im</span><span>  prove  the  quality  of  the  milk  supply</span><span>  from  their  properties.</span><span>  Mr.  Schwartz  said  he  objected  to  tne</span><span>  Continued  on  Pago  Eight.</span></p> <p><span>  MILK  PRODUCERS</span><span>  I  '</span><span>  ALARMED</span><span>  (Continued  from  Column  Five,</span><span>  Page  One)</span></p> <p><span>  w  9</span><span>  way  Beaudesert  was  'being  slandered</span><span>  regarding  its  milk  not'  being  up  to</span><span>  standard.

"<p><span>  (To  the  Editor)</span></p> <p><span>  Sir,  —  I  would  be  grateful  if  you  would</span><span>  grant  me  space  to  reply  to  Mr.  T.  F.</span><span>  Flunkett's  letter  appearing  in  the</span><span>  Beaudesert  ""Times""  15/2/46.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  PlunkettJias  avoided  committing</span><span>  himself  as  to  whether  the  L.  and  A.</span><span>  Dairy  Assoc.  holds  a  monopoly  or  not.</span><span>  I  still  maintain  that  they  do  hold  a</span><span>  monopoly  over  milk  and  cream,  whe</span><span>  ther  it  be  by  legal  privilege  or  other</span><span>  wise,  and  I  base  my  opinion  on  the</span><span>  meaning  of  the  word  ""monopoly""  as</span><span>  shown  in  Fowlers  Oxford  Dictionary.</span><span>  Mr.  Plunkett  states  that  the  distribu</span><span>  tion  of  £265,058  is  a  very  worthy</span><span>  achievement.  The  L.  &  A.  Assoc.  would</span><span>  have  been  in  a  much  prouder  position</span><span>  if  they  could  have  said  they  distributed</span><span>  this  amount  under  a  purely  voluntary</span><span>  co-operative  effort,  against  all  com</span><span>  petition,  like  the  two  Co-operative</span><span>  Bacon  Associations,  operating  in  Beau</span><span>  desert,  can  say.  The  position  as  I  see  it</span><span>  is  that  the  L.  &  A.  Assoc.  distributed</span><span>  this  amount  under  cover  of  a  mono</span><span>  poly,  whereby  it  was  practically  made  a</span><span>  compulsory  co-operative  effort  with</span><span>  out  competition.</span><span>  Mi'.  Plunkett  says  that  I  held  a</span><span>  license  under  the  Cream  -Transport</span><span>  Regulations  which  gave  me  the  sole</span><span>  right  to  a  particular  cream  route  and</span><span>  says  he  does  not  remember  me  saying</span><span>  anything  about  monopoly  at  that  time.</span><span>  That  is  quite  correct.  I,  like  the  L.  &</span><span>  A.  Assoc.,  was  in  business  before  these</span><span>  regulations  were  gazetted,  and  on  their</span><span>  gazettal  about  1937,  'I  admit  that  it</span><span>  gave  me  a  monopoly  over  my  particu</span><span>  lar  cream  route,  the  same  as  it  gave</span><span>  the  L.  &  A.  Assoc.  a  'monopoly  over  the</span><span>  cream  in  this  district,  but  Mr.  Plunkett</span><span>  failed  to  mention,  that  at  the  first</span><span>  available  opportunity,  I  gave  up  that</span><span>  monopoly  because  it  conflicted  with  my</span><span>  principles.  We  still  find  Mr.  Plunkett</span><span>  controlling  the  L.  &  A.  monopoly  de</span><span>  spite  the  fact  that  he  has  publicly  an</span><span>  nounced  that  he  is  opposed  to  mono</span><span>  polies.</span><span>  Mr.  Plunkett  also  is  not  too  sure  that</span><span>  there  are  any  discontenters.  I  refer</span><span>  him  to  the  report  of  the  Q.D.O.  meet</span><span>  ing  in  Beaudesert  ""Times""  15/2/46.</span><span>  Producers  and  carriers  have  more  to  do</span><span>  than  to  go  on  deputations  of  this  na</span><span>  ture  if  they  have  no  cause  for  com</span><span>  plaint.</span><span>  Mr.  Plunkett  refers  to  the  refusal  of</span><span>  permits  for  necessary  buildings.  It</span><span>  would  be  interesting  to  know  whetner</span><span>  the  permits  were  refused  for  extensions</span><span>  to  the  present  factory  so  as  to  cope</span><span>  with  the  cream  situation  or  if  the  per</span><span>  mits  were  for  buildings  to  manufacture</span><span>  powdered  milk.  Then  Mfi-.  Plunkett</span><span>  gives  what  he  calls  solid  soothing  facts.</span><span>  One  of  them  being  that  milk  supply</span><span>  having  priority  No.  1  had  to  be  re</span><span>  ceived  and  treated  with  limited  space</span><span>  first,  thus  delaying  the  delivery  of</span><span>  cream  into  the  factory.</span><span>  The  milk  supply  had  No.  1  priority</span><span>  long  before  the  L.  &  A.  Asoc.  decided</span><span>  to  dabble  in  it,  and  I  would  like  to</span><span>  know  why.  with  such  limited  space,</span><span>  was  the  L.  &  A.  Assoc.  plunged  into</span><span>  the  milk  trade  so  soon  when  the  direc</span><span>  tors  had  all  those  solid  soothing  facts,</span><span>  of  no  manpower,  no  materials,  no  per</span><span>  mits,  no  transport  etc.,  before  them.</span><span>  The  solid  facts  are  that  the  L.  &  A..</span><span>  Assoc.  has  entered  the  milk  trade  be</span><span>  fore  they  were  properly  equipped  to</span><span>  handle  milk,  consequently  the  cream</span><span>  has  to  suffer  by  standing  on  the  road</span><span>  up  to  four  or  five  hours,  and  cream</span><span>  producers  can  do  nothing  about  it  be</span><span>  cause  the  factory  holds  a  monopoly</span><span>  over  this  cream.</span><span>  Not  so  soothing  for  those  who  are</span><span>  concerned.  More  like  a  bitter  pill,  but</span><span>  Mr.  Plunkett  has  led  us  to  believe  it</span><span>  will  be  oaky-doaky.  in  the  sweet  by  and</span><span>  by.  (If  some  solid  soothing  fact  does</span><span>  not  intervene).</span><span>  Mr.  Piunkett's  comparison  of  grad-</span><span>  ings  between  1944  and  1945  periods  are</span><span>  amusing  because  four  of  the  peak</span><span>  months  in  the  1944  period  were  graded</span><span>  under  the  same  conditions  as  the  1945</span><span>  period.  It  would  be  interesting  to  re</span><span>  call  at  this  stage  that  for  the  year</span><span>  ending  30th  June  1945,  the  L.  &  A.</span><span>  Assoc.  had  27.57  per  cent,  of  it's  so</span><span>  called  choice  butter  officially  graded</span><span>  back  to  first  grade  and  125  boxes  of</span><span>  the  same  choice  butter  graded  into</span><span>  second  grade;  the  1943  figures  show</span><span>  only  7.98  per  cent,  to  be  graded  back.</span><span>  With  this  rapid  advance  what  will  the</span><span>  1946  figures  show?</span><span>  It  is  not  the  grade  appearing  on  the</span><span>  cream  slip,  which  are  the  monthly  re</span><span>  turns  submitted  to  the  Department  of</span><span>  Agriculture,  that  Mr.  Plunkett  has  re</span><span>  ferred  to.  These  are  only  eye-wash.  It</span><span>  is  the  final  official  grading  that  ulti</span><span>  mately  determines  the  price  to  be  paid.</span><span>  Mr.  Plunkett  replies  to  my  statement</span><span>  that  suppliers  are  paying  the  price  for</span><span>  delays  by  reduction  in  grade  of  cream,</span><span>  by  stating  that  such  statements  are  not</span><span>  borne  out  by  facts.</span><span>  The  facts  are  that  for  the  year  end</span><span>  ing  30th  June  1945,  out  of  a  total  of</span><span>  45,732  boxes  of  butter  submitted  for</span><span>  grading  only  27,074  boxes,  representing</span><span>  59.2  per  cent.,  were  officially  graded  as</span><span>  choice,  leaving  40.8  per  cent,  of  the</span><span>  yearly  output  as  lower  grades.  The</span><span>  1943  figures  are  79.58  per  cent,  choice</span><span>  and  20.42  per  cent,  lower  grades,  thus</span><span>  showing  an  increase  of  100  per  cent.</span><span>  In  lower  grades  in  1945.  More  soothing</span><span>  facts  to  show  all  is  not  well.</span><span>  Mr.  Plunkett  states  that  it  was  the</span><span>  present  Government  that  brought  in</span><span>  the  Cream  Transport  Act.  The  Act</span><span>  was  brought  in  by  a  Forgan  Smith</span><span>  Government  about  1937  and  not  by  the</span><span>  present  Government.</span><span>  I  admit  that  I  advised  the  Q.D.O.  to</span><span>  take  this  matter  of  cream  delays  up</span><span>  with  the  appropriate  authorities  and</span><span>  not  wait  on  the  factory  directors  to  be</span><span>  told  solid  soothing  facts.  The  Q.D.O.</span><span>  already  has  the  facts  and  I  feel  sure  if</span><span>  these  facts  were  placed  before  the  pro</span><span>  per  authorities  steps  would  be  taken</span><span>  to  alter  the  conditions  at  the  factory,</span><span>  either  by  Act  of  Parliament  or  other</span><span>  wise.</span><span>  In  conclusion  I  would  say  that  I  can</span><span>  take  anything  Mr.  Plunkett,  as  head</span><span>  of  the  L.  &  A.  Assoc..  ean  Inflict  on  me</span><span>  without  the  aid  of  Parliament  as  Mr.</span><span>  Plunkett  suggests  I  should  get.  It  is  not</span><span>  with  any  thought  of  personal  gain  that</span><span>  I  have  taken  up  my  pen  but  with  the</span><span>  object  of  improving  the  conditions  for</span><span>  farmers  and  carriers  of  this  district.</span><span>  Yours  etc.  —</span></p> <p><span>  J.

'</span><span>  Cattle  men  studied  the  fat  bullock</span><span>  and  the  competition  proved  a  keen  one.</span><span>  The  animal  will  be  slaughtered  and  the</span><span>  announcement  of  its  weight  will  be</span><span>  awaited  with  interest.</span><span>  Judges,  at  a  smoke  social  in  the</span><span>  Grand  Hotel  ballroom  on  Wednesday</span><span>  night,  spoke  very  highly  of  the  qual</span><span>  ity  of  the  stock  seen  tiiat  day.</span><span>  The  President  (Mr.  H.  Bruxner),  who</span><span>  presided,  congratulated  exhibitors  who</span><span>  did  so  well.  Visitors  had  remarked  on</span><span>  the  wonderful  quality  of  the  exhibits.</span><span>  The  society  always  set  out  to  get  the</span><span>  best  judges  possible,  and  he  was  sure</span><span>  all  agreed  they  had  a  splendid  body  of</span><span>  judges  that  day.  ,</span><span>  Responding  to  a  toast  in  honour  of</span><span>  the  judges,  Mr.  J.  F.  Burnett  (Harris-</span><span>  ville)  said  that  he  was  very  impressed</span><span>  with  the  setting  of  the  grounds.  The</span><span>  alterations  were  most  marked,  and</span><span>  Beaudesert  had  the  makings  of  one  of</span><span>  the  sweetest  little  grounds  in  Queens</span><span>  land.  Entries  in  the  cattle  classes  that</span><span>  day  were  astounding.-  The  maiden  hack</span><span>  drew  20  competitors,  which  was  rather</span><span>  outstanding,  and  there  were  some  good</span><span>  horses.  The  pony  mare  winner  would</span><span>  be  hard  to  beat  anywhere  In  Queens</span><span>  land.  Taken  all  through'  the  Society</span><span>  should  feel  highly  satisfied  with  the</span><span>  show,  and  the  fine  horses  competing.</span><span>  Mr.  Bruxner  apologised  lor  the  ab</span><span>  sence  of  Mr.  H.  Simpson,  who  judged</span><span>  the  beef  cattle.  He  said  Mr.  Simpson</span><span>  asked  him  to  repeat  the  fact  that  he</span><span>  said  he  had  judged  quite  a  lot  of  fat</span><span>  cattle  at  different  shows,  but  he  had</span><span>  never  judged  a  better  lot  than  he  did</span></p> <p><span>  that  day.  They  were  fit  to  win  in  any</span><span>  show  he  had  been  toi</span><span>  Mr.  Bruxner  said  that  coming  from</span><span>  such  an  eminent  judge  that  was  pleas</span><span>  ing  news.</span><span>  Mr.  James,  A.I.S.  judge,  said  it  was</span><span>  the  third  occasion  he  officiated  at</span><span>  Beaudesert,  and  he  always  looked  for</span><span>  ward  to  seeing  the  Beaudesert  people</span><span>  again.  He  congratulated  the  A.I.S.</span><span>  exhibitors  on  the  wonderful  show  of</span><span>  cattle,  and  the  condition  they  were</span><span>  produced  hi.  Some  outstanding  stock</span><span>  was  paraded  before  him.</span><span>  ""I  travelled  nearly  1000  miles  to  be</span><span>  with  you  today,  and  I  am,  not  sorry,""</span><span>  said  Mr.  S.  Larbalestier,  Judge  of  the</span><span>  Jerseys.  He  said'  that  a  Victorian  judge</span><span>  once  advised  him  that  Queenslanders</span><span>  were  the  greatest  people  on  earth.  He</span><span>  found  this  out.  When  he  arrived  tliey</span><span>  put  him  in  a  home  away  from  home.</span><span>  Mr.  Larbalestier  said  that  the  Jer</span><span>  sey  section  was  a  very  creditable  one</span><span>  for  a  country  show,  and  one  of  the</span><span>  best  he  had  seen.  The  winning  pen  of  '</span><span>  three  cows  —  and  there  were  nine  en</span><span>  tries  —  was  one  of  the  finest  he  had</span><span>  seen  for  many  a  day.  The  young</span><span>  champion  cow  was  the  ideal  type</span><span>  they  looked  for,  and  the  champion</span><span>  bull  was  something  out  of  the  bag  —</span><span>  a  beautiful  bull  who  would  go  a  long</span><span>  way.</span><span>  Tire  Ayrshire  judge,  Mr.  J.  Brownlie,</span><span>  found  his  section  one  of  the  best  he</span><span>  had  seen  at  a  country  show  in  Queens</span><span>  land,  and  he  had  been  at  many  as</span><span>  judge  and  exhibitor.  The  section  was</span><span>  small  in  quantity,  but  not  in  quality.</span><span>  He  saw  the  finest  type  of  cow  they</span><span>  would  see  in  Australia.  The  grounds</span><span>  were  ideal  for  a  country  show.  He  con</span><span>  gratulated  the  exhibitors  on  the  way</span><span>  they  produced  their  cattle.  They  went</span><span>  to  as  much  trouble  as  if  they  were</span><span>  showing  in  the  Royal  National  show.</span><span>  He  expected  to  see  some  of  the  stock</span><span>  at  the  Brisbane  exhibition  in  August.</span><span>  He  congratulated  Mr.  Dunn  who  was</span><span>  showing  a  fine  team  at  his  first  show.</span><span>  Mr.  Dunn  had  quality  In  his  herd.</span><span>  Speaking  on  the  stud  pigs,  Mi'.

It  was  pleasing  to  see</span><span>  the  young  stock  coming  on.  The  cham</span><span>  pions  of  today  would  not  hold  their</span><span>  place  next  show  as  a  fine  lot  of  youngs</span><span>  ters  were  coming  on.  Five  outstanding</span><span>  sows  were  put  before  him,  and  the</span><span>  winners  were  closely  pressed  by  the  ,</span><span>  young  sows.  It  was  lite  third  visit  to</span><span>  Beaudesert.  He  congratulated  the</span><span>  breeders  on  the  way  they  brought  the</span><span>  pigs  out.</span><span>  The  judge  of  the  export  pigs  was</span><span>  disappointed  at  the  small  number</span><span>  seen,  but  this  was  attributed  to  con</span><span>  ditions  in  the  industry  today.  lie  ad</span><span>  vocated  young  farmers  being  present</span><span>  at  shows  so  that  the  decisions  of  the</span><span>  judges  could  be  explained  to  them.</span><span>  He  said  that  England  did  not  want</span><span>  fat  bacon.  Australia  had  to  breed  to</span><span>  type,  and  the  sooner  producers  con</span><span>  centrated  on  the  long  lean  hog  the</span><span>  better.  He  said  the  Government  should</span><span>  prevent  the  export  of  fat  pigs.  Fat  pigs</span><span>  were  of  no  use,  and  only  a  waste  of</span><span>  good  feed.  What  was  wanted  for  the</span><span>  Australian  trade  was  wanted  by  Eng</span><span>  land.</span><span>  Mr.  F.  Walsh  of  the  Department  of</span><span>  Agriculture  and  Stock,  who  was  in</span><span>  charge  of  the  milk  testing,  said  two  of</span><span>  the  classes  provided  keen  competition.</span><span>  The  cow  that  won  the  open  also  won</span><span>  last  year  which  proved  it  was  110  fluke.</span><span>  A  return  of  1.0  lb.  of  butter  fat  was  a</span><span>  very  good  performance.

The  members  of</span><span>  the  premiership  team  would  also  re</span><span>  ceive  caps.</span><span>  It  was  decided  to  place  on  record  a</span><span>  vote  of  thanks  to  the  Messrs.  Wright</span><span>  brothers  for  their  gift.</span><span>  Mr.  E.  Duff  moved  against  the  ad</span><span>  mission  of  the  Maroon  B  grade  team</span><span>  as  itr.  would  make  the  distance  to  be</span><span>  travelled  too  great.  Maroon  also  had</span><span>  an  A  grade  team  hi  the  Boonah  As</span><span>  sociation,  and  the  Beaudesert  players</span><span>  did  not  know  the  capabilities  of  the</span><span>  Maroon  players.</span><span>  Mr.  G.  A.  Teese  said  that  Innisplains</span><span>  hoped  to  field  a  B  grade  team,  and</span><span>  suggested  that  it  might  be  possible  to</span><span>  zone  the  B  graders.</span><span>  Mr.  Duff  said  that  zoning  would  re</span><span>  strict  cricket  for  the  young  players</span><span>  who  should  meet  as  many  different</span><span>  teams  as  possible.</span><span>  It  was  stated  that  Maroon  had  not</span><span>  sent  a  delegate  to  the  meeting,  and  it</span><span>  was  telt  they  were  not  proceedmg  with</span><span>  their  intention;  also  tnat  it  was  not</span><span>  thought  Rathdowney  would  enter  the</span><span>  competition  if  zoning  came  about.</span><span>  It  was  decided  to  advise  Maroon</span><span>  that,  in  view  of  the  distances  to  be</span><span>  travelled,  the  club  could  not  be  ad</span><span>  mitted,  and  no  action  was  taken  on</span><span>  tne  zoning  proposal.</span><span>  Mr.  Teese  said  Innisplains  might</span><span>  find  it  difficult  to  field  a  team  in  mid</span><span>  summer  because  they  came  '  from  a</span><span>  smail  district.  The  players  would'  do</span><span>  the  best  they  could  to  keep  going.</span><span>  It  was  decided  to  accept  the  offer</span><span>  of  the  Beaudesert  ""Times""  to  pro</span><span>  vide  score  cards  for  record  purposes,</span><span>  the  winning  team  to  be  responsible</span><span>  for  having  a  completed  card  lodged</span><span>  at  the  ""Times""  oftice  by  noon  on  the</span><span>  Tuesday  following  a  match.</span><span>  Messrs.  W.  A.  Watt,  V.  Day  and  J.</span><span>  Gill  were  re-elected  A  grade  selectors.</span><span>  Messrs.  W.  Strong  and  A.  Draheim</span><span>  were  also  nominated.</span><span>  In  reviewing  what  had  taken  place</span><span>  regarding  the  selection  of  teams  last</span><span>  year  it  was  stated  that  at  least  on  one</span><span>  occasion  one  selector  announced  ""a</span><span>  team  himself,  and  that  on  other  oc</span><span>  casions  two  selectors  picked  the  side</span><span>  over  the  lelephone.  Some  of  the</span><span>  matches  for  the  second  teams  had  been</span><span>  arranged  at  such  short  notice  there</span><span>  had  not  been  time  for  selectors  to  be</span><span>  '  contacted.</span><span>  Mr.  W.  Strong  considered  that  in</span><span>  some  cases  age  had  been  given  prefer</span><span>  ence  over  youth,  which  was  a  mistake.</span><span>  Mr.  Gill  said  If  he  were  selected  he</span><span>  would  see  that  confusion  over  selec</span><span>  tions  did  not  happen  again.</span><span>  Mr.  M.  Barrett  said  that  there  had</span><span>  not  been  a  B  grade  interassociatioiv</span><span>  match  last  season.  B  graders  should</span><span>  be  given  preference  to  second  A</span><span>  grade  teams.</span><span>  Messrs.  E.-Duff.  S.  Hiscock,  R.  Willis,</span><span>  V.  McGovern  and  J.  C.  Barrett  were</span><span>  nominated  as  B  grade  selectors,  with</span></p> <p><span>  tne  last  tnree  eiectea.</span><span>  Delegates  said  they  hoped  that  cattle</span><span>  would  be  kept  off  the  Selwyn  Park</span><span>  oval  this  season.  .</span><span>  Mr.  C.

Duff  and  J.  Gill  were</span><span>  elected  a  Fixture  Subcommittee.  A</span><span>  move  to  commence  the  fixtures  on</span><span>  September  22  was  defeated  by  a  nar</span><span>  row  margin.</span><span>  A  meeting  of  ten  members  of  the</span><span>  Colts  Club  on  Monday  night  decided</span><span>  .  to  change  the  club  name  to  the  ""Beau</span><span>  desert  Cricket  Club.""  Messrs.  S.  Cal-</span><span>  lanan,  J.  GUI  and  W.  McGuire  were</span><span>  elected  selectors,  and  Mr.  W.

In  this  instance  1  am</span><span>  much  amused,""  writes  Mr.  Arthur  ,</span><span>  Groom,  of  Binna  Burra.</span><span>  Mr.  Groom  adds:  Mr.  Payne  elects  to</span><span>  tell  the  people  why  Binna-Burra  ""en-</span><span>  Joyed  the  use  of  more  walking  tracks;.""</span><span>  and  resorts  to  compansion  between</span><span>  Binna-Burra  and  O'Reillys,  and  com</span><span>  ment  on  the  Sub-Department  of  For</span><span>  estry  and  Main  Roads  Commission.</span><span>  Companions  are  usua.ly  odious,  and</span><span>  comparers  should  know  their  subject.</span><span>  Both  the  O'Reilly  and  Binna-Burra</span><span>  organisations  have  battled  for  years</span><span>  towards  an  ideal  of  national  service</span><span>  to  the  public.</span><span>  Mr.  Payne's  first  quoted  track  dis</span><span>  tance  is  a  big  mistake.  He  claims  the</span><span>  Bell-Bird  track  is  six  miies  long.  This</span><span>  place  is  on  Binna-Burra  private  pro</span><span>  perty.  The  track  is  only  three-quarter</span><span>  mile  long,  and  every  inch  of  it  con</span><span>  structed  by  voluntary  and  paid  Binna-</span><span>  Burra  labour.  Hereunder,  I  give  some</span><span>  of  the  correct  history.</span><span>  Prior  to  1933,  Binna-Burra  did  not</span><span>  exits  as  a  tourist  centre,  and  the  only</span><span>  graded  track  in  existence  was  a  short</span><span>  length  of  half  a  mile  constructed  as  an</span><span>  experiment  under  the  supervision  of</span><span>  Mr.  R,  W.  Lahey,  many  years  before.</span><span>  I  do  not  think  Mr.  Payne  knows  the</span><span>  location  of  this  trackl  In  March,  1934.</span><span>  Queensland  Holiday  Resorts  Ltd.,  (the</span><span>  small  company  controlling  Binna-</span><span>  Burra),  was  registered  with  its  tiny</span><span>  capital  of  £2,300,  and  a  commitment  to</span><span>  purchase  private  property  for  a  sum  in</span><span>  excess  of  £3,000.  This  property  had  no</span><span>  access  whatever;  and  for  some  years</span><span>  maximum  accommodation  could  be  pro</span><span>  vided  only  in  tents.  However,  mainly</span><span>  through  the  energy  of  Mr.  R.  W.  Lahey.</span><span>  it  was  decided  by  the  Binna-Burra</span><span>  directors  to  Introduce  Into  the  Lam-  '</span><span>  ington  National  Park,  a  graded  and</span><span>  constructed  type  of  walking  track</span><span>  which  would  aliow  elderly  people  and</span><span>  convalescents  to  appreciate  the  scenery.</span><span>  Air.  Lahey  and  others  did  an  incred</span><span>  ible  amount  of  voluntary  work  in  thus</span><span>  founding  a  movement  and  type  of</span><span>  track  wnich  Is  now  standard  in  several</span><span>  of  Queensland's  National  Parks.  This</span><span>  fact  has  never  been  ""shouted  from</span><span>  the  rooftops.""  Paid  and  voluntary</span><span>  labour  were  used.</span><span>  Mr.  Payne  declares  that  the  Main</span><span>  Roads  Commission  ""favoured  Binna-</span><span>  Burra  with  a  good  gravel  road;""  but</span><span>  he  omits  to  exp.ain  that  Binna-Burra</span><span>  surveyed  and  built  the  first  road  three</span><span>  miles  over  very  difficult  country  with</span><span>  several  large  and  long  rock  cuttings;</span><span>  nor  does  he  explain  that  cars  can</span><span>  drive  into  O'Reilly's  now,  and  Binna-</span><span>  Burra  still  has  no  road  to  the  summit.</span><span>  Nor  does  he  point  out  that  this  road</span><span>  and  track  work  by  Binna-Burra  ate  up</span><span>  £1,100  of  the  tiny  capital  resorces  avail</span><span>  able,  almost  putting  the  company  into</span><span>  liquidation  time  after  time.</span><span>  Air.  Payne  d.d  not  state  that  Binna-</span><span>  Burra  from  its  inception,  ran  and</span><span>  guaranteed  a  car  service  from  Binna-</span><span>  Burra  to  Brisbane  on  a  registered  time</span><span>  table  and  fare,  and  faced  a  loss  of</span><span>  £309  in  its  first  year  of  operation.  No</span><span>  wonder  a  gravel  road  was  built!</span><span>  Mr.  Payne  has  not  explained  that</span><span>  Binna-Burra  build  all  graded  tracks</span><span>  from  the  lodge  to  the  park  boundary;</span><span>  constructed  the  graded  track  to  within</span><span>  one  third  of  a  mile  of  the  Coomera</span><span>  Falls,  down  to  the  Gwongoorool  Swim</span><span>  ming  Pool,  out  to  the  head  of  Nixon's</span><span>  Creek,  one  and  a  half  miies  of  what</span><span>  is  now  the  main  track  between  Binna-</span><span>  Burra  and  O'Reilly's,  most  of  the</span><span>  track  to  the  Aboriginal  Cooking  cave</span><span>  (Kweebanl),  and  to  other  places  —  a</span><span>  total  of  just  over  10  miles.  He  did  not</span><span>  point  out  that  Binna-Burra  ran  trial</span><span>  surveys  and  locations  to  a  large  net</span><span>  work  of  scenic  spots  on  both  ""sides""</span><span>  of  the  Park;  much  of  which  was  of</span><span>  great  assistance  in  subsequent  track</span><span>  construction.</span><span>  Mr.  Payne  apparently  does  not  know</span><span>  that  after  all  this  foundation  work  an</span><span>  offer  was  made  by  the  Forestry  de</span><span>  partment  to  both  Binna-Burra  and  '</span><span>  O'Reiily's  that  further  track  construc</span><span>  tion  be  subsidized  on  a  50  per  cent,</span><span>  basis.  Binna-Burra  accepted  and  con</span><span>  tinued  with  the  work.</span><span>  It  is  not  surprising  then,  that  when</span><span>  the  Forestry  Department  found  it  pos</span><span>  sible  to  finance  and  take  over  all  fur</span><span>  ther  track  construction  and  mainten</span><span>  ance  within  the  Lamington  National</span><span>  Park,  that  Binna-Burra  had  a  con</span><span>  siderable  lead  which  it  has  maintained</span><span>  ever  since.  Mr.  Payne  has  not  pointed</span><span>  out  how  Air.  R.  W.  Lahey,  as  a  Dir</span><span>  ector  of  Binna-Burra,  did  all  the  early</span><span>  survey  work  on  both  ""sides""  of  the</span><span>  Park  until  a  departmental  man  was</span><span>  trained.  He  has  not  pointed  out  that</span><span>  the  O'Reilly's  might  well  have  had</span><span>  more  tracks  had  they  constructed  con</span><span>  necting  tracks'  across  their  private</span><span>  property,  as  was  done  at  Binna-Burra.</span><span>  Air.  Payne  has  forgotten  to  point</span><span>  out  many  things.  He  should  brush  up</span><span>  his  general  knowledge.  Why  refer  to</span><span>  the  O'Reilly  area  as  Lamington  Plat</span><span>  eau,  -when  it  has  been  so  long  known</span><span>  as  Robert's  Plateau?  Why  remark  on</span><span>  the  change  of  a  temporary  name  of</span><span>  Mount  Roberts  to  that  of  Binna-Burra,</span></p> <p><span>  when  O'Reilly's  quite  justifiably  are</span><span>  changing  the  name  of  their  area  to</span><span>  Green  Mountains?  Why  quote  Curtis</span><span>  Falls  as  being  within  the  Lamington</span><span>  National  Park,  when,  as  far  as  I  know</span><span>  this  beauty  spot  is  still  'on  Tamborine</span><span>  Mountain?</span><span>  Why  call  Orchid  Bower,  Orchard</span><span>  Bower?  and  Araucaria  Lookout  as  Aur-</span><span>  encarla?  Wagawn  as  Wagawun?  Why</span><span>  suggest  that  Egg  Rock  is  within  the</span><span>  park  and  has  a  five  mile  graded  track</span><span>  to  it,  when  it  really  it  well  out  of  the</span><span>  park  on  private  property,  and  has  no</span><span>  graded  track  anywhere  near  it?  Why</span><span>  call  Gwongoorool  as  Wangarool?  Why</span><span>  divide  the  Lamington  National  Park</span><span>  into  ""sides""  at  all.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr,  Payne  attempts  to  cleave  a  way</span><span>  through  a  glorious  area  which  in  no</span><span>  way  belongs  to  the  O'Relliy  or  Binna-</span><span>  Burra  organisations,  but  to  the  people</span><span>  of  Queensland.  I  can  understand  iair</span><span>  enthusiasm  in  anyone  concerning  the</span><span>  Lamington  National  Park  and  the</span><span>  people  who  have  pioneered  tourist</span><span>  traffic  within  it;  but  I  suggest  that</span><span>  Air.  Payne  should  begin  entirely  anew</span><span>  in  his  study  of  the  history  of  the  Lam</span><span>  ington  National  Park,  and  of  the  pion</span><span>  eering  stories  behind  the  O'Reilly  and</span><span>  Binna-Burra  organisations;  and  when</span><span>  he  has  spent  19  hard  years  at  It,  as  I</span><span>  have,  he  m.ght  accomp.ish  something</span><span>  worth-while  in  the  way  of  helpful  ad</span><span>  vice  and  criticism.</span><span>  In  his  comparison  of  mileages,  Atr.</span><span>  Payne  declares  Binna-Burra  has  60</span><span>  miles  of  graded  track,  and  O'Reilly's</span><span>  30  miles.  The  official  list  I  have  be</span><span>  fore  me  gives  three  zones.  That  based</span><span>  on  O'Reilly's  as  31  miles  of  graded,</span><span>  track  construction;  that  based  on</span><span>  Hlinbah  to  westward  and  until  just</span><span>  recently  in  disuse  as  5  miles,  and</span><span>  that  based  on  Binna-Burra  as</span><span>  475  (  Mr.  Payne  also  has  omitted</span><span>  to  point  out  that  for  some</span><span>  years  past,  Binna-Burra  has  opened</span><span>  up  trial  tracks  and  viewpoints  well</span><span>  down  the  southern  end  of  the  National</span><span>  Park  from  Echo  Point,  over  Worendo,</span><span>  Wupawn,  Throakban,  and  out  to  the</span><span>  end  of  Widgee;  ancl  that  this  work  will</span><span>  be  of  great  assistance  in  future  graded</span><span>  track  construction,  which,  geographic</span><span>  ally  will  be  far  more  accessible  to</span><span>  O'Reilly's  than  to  Binna-Burra.</span><span>  I  trust  Mr.  Payne  and  other  readers</span><span>  do  not  think  my  reply  Is  a  criticism  of</span><span>  the  O'Reilly  effort.  Binna-Burra  does</span><span>  not  lose  sight  of  the  fact  that  the</span><span>  O'Reilly  family  met  obstacles  and  hard-</span></p> <p><span>  ships  and  disappointments  which</span><span>  would  have  cracked  the  average  person</span><span>  time  and  again.</span><span>  However,  it  is  good  to  see  and  hear</span><span>  Beaudesert  people  talk  of  National</span><span>  Park  development:  but  rather  than</span><span>  listen  to  criticism  which  can  only  split</span><span>  the  whole  glorious  area  into  oppos</span><span>  ition  '  camps,  would  it  not  be  much</span><span>  better  for  these  enthusiasts  to  pause</span><span>  awhile  and  survey  as  one  unit  the</span><span>  scenic  rim  of  mountains  running  from</span><span>  Cunningham's  Gap  (also  a  National</span><span>  Park)  to  Sprlngbrook  (where  ..there  Is</span><span>  still  another  important  National  Park)  ?</span><span>  And  would  it  not  be  more  -national</span><span>  In  spirit  to  work  for  the  creation  of'</span><span>  one  large  National  Park  for  all  this</span><span>  area?
