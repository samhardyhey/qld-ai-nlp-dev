"<p><span>  BEAUDESERT  RACES</span></p> <p><span>  The  attendance  at  the  Beaudes</span><span>  ert  and  District  Amateur  Race  Cluli</span><span>  meeting  on  Wednesday  showed  an</span><span>  increase  over  that  of  the  last  meet</span><span>  ing,  which  in  turn  was  siightly  bet-</span></p> <p><span>  ter  than  tiie  previous  meeting.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  other  hand  there  was  a</span><span>  slight  falling  off  in  the  number  of</span><span>  final  acceptors.  A  surprising  fea</span><span>  ture  was  the  fact  that  only  lour  of</span><span>  the  12  acceptors  for  the  Second  Di</span><span>  vision  of  tiie  Hack  Handicap  went</span><span>  to  the  post,  making  14  hacks  all</span><span>  told.  At  the  previous  few  meetings</span><span>  the  club  found  difficulty  handling</span><span>  them,  and  a  third  division  was</span><span>  necessary  at  the  July  meeting,  with</span><span>  20  starters  in  the  two  divisions  last</span><span>  meeting.</span><span>  This  was  the  only  weak  race  on  the</span><span>  programme,  58  starting  in  the  other  six</span><span>  races,  with  three  of  eleven,  and  one</span><span>  of  ten,  the  best.</span><span>  On  the  day  the  favourites  were</span><span>  beaten  as  the  following  winning  prices</span><span>  will  reveal  (those  of  the  favourite  be</span><span>  ing  shown  in  brackets):  5  to  2  (2/1);</span><span>  2  to  1  (5/4  on);  8/1  (evens);  5  to  1</span><span>  (5/2);  3  to  1  (5/2);  7  to  2  (winner  and</span><span>  another  7/2);  5  to  1  (evens).</span><span>  Solwong  carried  a  lot  of  local  money</span><span>  in  the  First  Division  of  the  Hack  Divi</span><span>  sion,  but  could  do  no  better  than  fourth</span><span>  although  it  looked  as  if  he  would  make</span><span>  a  place  as  the  field  came  up  the</span><span>  straight,  with  him  out  wide.  Over  the</span><span>  final  distance  he  slowed  up,  and  was</span><span>  beaten  for  fourth  by  a  neck.  Grand</span><span>  Rapide,  who  was  in  front  when  the</span><span>  field  settled  down  won  by  two  lengths,</span><span>  with  Black  Pal  second  and  the  2  to  1</span><span>  favourite,  Bright  Humour,  third.  The</span><span>  latter  was  away  badly,  after  a  start  in</span><span>  which  Jedar  and  he  proved  difficult  to</span><span>  handle.  Lilypal  was  placed  in  the</span><span>  middle  of  the  field  for  the  most  part.</span><span>  Quarry  was  anything  but  the  good</span><span>  thing  that  punters  considered  him  to</span><span>  be  before  the  Second  Division  of  the</span><span>  Hack,  when  they  sent  him  out  at  5  to  4</span><span>  on.  Good  Reason  handled  the  going</span><span>  with  ease,  and  could  have  won  by  more</span><span>  than  the  two  lengths  that  he  had  to</span><span>  spare  at  the  judge.  David's  First  was  a</span><span>  bad  last.</span><span>  After  being  placed  last  in  the  early</span><span>  running,  Harold's  Pal  finished  well,</span><span>  and  made  fourth  place  in  the  Seventh</span><span>  Division,  of  six  furlongs.  Tiie  even</span><span>  money  Bolivia  was  second  last  home,</span><span>  with  the  8  to  1  Pen  William  finishing</span><span>  fast,  and  stealing  the  honours  from</span><span>  Swnil  .Tnu  whn  /lowiu/l  a  lftf  rennau</span></p> <p><span>  at  threes.  Amity  Lad  and  Silver  Chief</span><span>  made  the  going,  with  Swan  Joy  taking</span><span>  charge  from  Silver  Chief  half  way  up</span><span>  the  straight.</span><span>  Having  her  third  start  in  a  race,  and</span><span>  the  first  for  some  time,  Michael  Smith's</span><span>  Sister  Silver  won  the  Eighth  Division,</span><span>  run  over  six  furlongs.  She  was  fairly</span><span>  well  supported  at  fives,  although  the</span><span>  bottom  weight  Taunggyi,  was  made  a</span><span>  5/2  favourite.  Good  Reason,  who  won</span><span>  her  first  start  so  comfortably,  was  sup</span><span>  ported  at  sixes.  She  had  suffered  a</span><span>  seven  pound  penalty,  but  this  was  com</span><span>  pensated  for  by  the  fact  tliat  Appren</span><span>  tice  Holt  had  the  mount.  Bay  Beauty</span><span>  and  Sister  Silver  were  the  first  to  show</span><span>  out,  with  the  latter  on  the  fence.  Sister</span><span>  Silver  hung  to  the  fence,  and  had  a</span><span>  neck  to  spare  with  two  furlongs  to  go.</span><span>  They  were  three  lengths  in  front  of</span><span>  Taunggyi,  who  led  the  rest  of  the  field.</span><span>  Good  Reason  joined  Sister  Silver  at</span><span>  the  home  turn,  and  they  made  a  great</span><span>  race  of  it.  Half  way  up  the  straight</span><span>  Good  Reason  looked  as  if  she  had  the</span><span>  race,  but  Sister  Silver  was  equal  to  the</span><span>  occasion,  and  came  again  when  the</span><span>  pressure  was  on,  and  won  by  a  neck,</span><span>  with  three-quarters  to  Fort  Constant,</span><span>  with  the  favourite  fourth.</span><span>  Asset  had  plenty  in  hand  when  he</span><span>  won  the  Fourth  Division,  of  7  furlongs,</span><span>  by  three  lengths  from  Sangallo  (20  to</span><span>  1).  Red  Mick,  who  was  5/2  favourite,</span><span>  was  prominent  at  one  stage.  Asset  had</span><span>  two  to  spare  from  Red  Mick  as  they</span><span>  swung  to  the  straight,  Mainfan  beat</span><span>  Expert,  by  a  head  for  fourth  place,  with</span></p> <p><span>  [?]</span></p> <p><span>  After  being  at  the  tail  of  the  field,</span><span>  Lo  Zonga  finished  very  last  in  the</span><span>  Fifth  Division,  of  0  furlongs,  and  was</span><span>  only  beaten  by  Brisbane  Damsel  by  a</span><span>  head.  It  was  a  good  race,  with  Tiger</span><span>  Royal,  who  had  always  been  promin</span><span>  ent,  a  length  and  a  half  third,  with</span><span>  Sweet  Cello  and  The  Orne  very  close.</span><span>  Brisbane  Damsel  and  Lo  Zonga  went;</span><span>  out  equal  favourites  at  7/2.</span><span>  Man  O'Gahvay  upset  calculations  by</span><span>  whining  the  Sixth  Division  at  fives,</span><span>  with  the  even  money  Speed  Spear  two</span><span>  lengths  worse.  A.  Burgess,  on  John</span><span>  Russo,  was  away  badly,  but  went</span><span>  through  his  field  at  a  fast  rate  to  take</span><span>  the  front,  and  lioid  it  until  the  field</span></p> <p><span>  ran  him  down  at  the  turn.

The  playing  field  is</span><span>  set  out  in  such  a  way  that  one  side</span><span>  plays  into  the  sun.  The  toss  went</span><span>  against  Beaudesert,  with  the  result</span><span>  that  they  had  this  big  disadvantage</span><span>  before  half  time.  Towards  the  closing</span><span>  stages  of  the  game,  however,  the  sun</span><span>  did  not  give  the  trouble  that  it  did</span><span>  earlier.</span><span>  The  Beaudesert  players  came  out  of</span><span>  the  tussle  with  colours  ilying  high,  and</span><span>  the  forwards  covering  themselves  with</span><span>  laurels.  They  were  against  a  solid  lot</span><span>  of  ruckers,  and  they  had  the  disad</span><span>  vantage  of  meeting  a  set  of,  backs  tnat</span><span>  was  smart  and  piercing  in  attack,  and</span><span>  wily  enough  to  take  advantage  ol  sev</span><span>  eral  weaknesses  that  made  tnemselves</span><span>  obvious  in  the  visiting  quarter  line.</span><span>  Beaudesert  received  a  set  back</span><span>  alter  play  had  been  in  progress  for</span><span>  nine  minutes,  full  back  l>.  Yuke  re</span><span>  ceiving  an  injury  that  caused  his  re</span><span>  tirement.  This  meant  that  winger  Â£.</span><span>  O'Brien  nad  to  drop  back,  and  i>.</span><span>  Freeman  lound  himself  a  winger.</span><span>  Tnis  change  naturaiiy  upset  the  bal</span><span>  ance  considerably.</span><span>  Although  O'Brien  was  lound  want</span><span>  ing  on  more  tnan  one  occasion,  and  his</span><span>  line  kicking  ability  was  not  ait  that  it</span><span>  could  nave  been,  ne  did  well  under  the</span><span>  circumstances.  Few  players,  untrained</span><span>  in  this  position,  can  put  up  a  show  at</span><span>  such  shore,  notice.</span><span>  The  winners  did  not  get  much  of  a</span><span>  chance  to  show  their  worth  as  try-get-</span><span>  fing  machines.  Abberdan  sola  Welling</span><span>  ton  far  too  many  dumps,  and  was</span><span>  caught  too  olten.  He  continually  at</span><span>  tempted  to  exploit  a  scoring  movement</span><span>  that  he  brought  otf  previously,  but  it</span><span>  was  valueless  on  Sunday.  Instead  of</span><span>  running  hard  and  straight,  and  leaving</span><span>  tne  rest  to  his  winger,  lie  ran  out  wide,</span><span>  giving  clumsy  imitations  of  dummy</span><span>  passing.  By  the  time  that  he  did  let  it</span><span>  go  the  movement  had  been  slowed</span><span>  down  to  something  like  a  jog  trot,  with</span><span>  Wellington  crowded,  and  set  for  a</span><span>  dump  as  soon  as  he  received.  In  de</span><span>  fence,  Abberdan  swallowed  almost</span><span>  everything  that  was  slung  Ills  way.</span></p> <p><span>  The  other  centre,  Blow,  kicked  his</span><span>  forwards  ""off  the  field""  in  the  first</span><span>  half,  besides  handling  badly,  and  prov</span><span>  ing  a  poor  team  man  when  it  came  to</span><span>  getting  the  side  moving.</span><span>  Overcoming  these  disabilities  added</span><span>  to  the  achievement  of  the  men  in  front,</span><span>  Day  worked  as  he  never  worked  before,</span><span>  despite  a  painful  eye  injury  received</span><span>  after  about  ten  minutes  of  play.  On</span><span>  more  than  one  occasion  he  burst</span><span>  through  the  opposition,  when  his  side</span><span>  was  under  pressure,  and  made  up</span><span>  ground.</span><span>  The  play  of  Deane,  as  five-eight</span><span>  could  not  be  faulted,  Like  the  rest  of</span><span>  his  side,  he  suffered  a  continual  bat</span><span>  tering  from  the  fast  breaking  opposi</span><span>  tion  forwards.</span><span>  Beaudesert  certainly,  won  17  of  the</span><span>  26  decisive  scrums  in  the  first  half,  and</span><span>  a  15-6  advantage  as  far  as  free  kicks</span><span>  were  concerned,  but  the  fast  attack  of</span><span>  the  opposition  offset  this  advantage.</span><span>  After  interval  the  scrums  were  equal  at</span><span>  12,  and  Wynnum  was  awarded  six  kicks</span><span>  to  five  against  them.</span><span>  The  match  was  in  charge  of  Ref.  W.</span><span>  Lewis,  who  contributed  towards  the</span><span>  speed  with  which  it  was  played.  He</span><span>  certainly  made  mistakes,  but  both  sides</span><span>  suffered,  and  there  was  nothing  to  sug</span><span>  gest  that  there  was  anything  partial</span><span>  in  it.</span><span>  Two  minutes  after  the  kick  off  Wyn</span><span>  num  attempted  a  long  kick  at  goal.  In</span><span>  the  first  seven  minutes  Beaudesert  won</span><span>  six  of  the  seven  scrums,  and,  when</span><span>  they  looked  like  being  in  trouble,  were</span><span>  awarded  a  free  kick  for  shepherding.</span><span>  Yuke  kicked  the  ground  when  he  tried</span><span>  a  long  kick  at  goal  at  nine  minutes,</span><span>  and  a  minute  later  he  was  caught  with</span><span>  the  ball,  and  he  had  to  be  replaced  by</span><span>  Freeman.</span><span>  Day  was  seen  in  a  great  individual</span><span>  effort,  but  he  was  not  fast  enough</span><span>  to  carry  on  on  his  own,  and  he  had</span><span>  no  support.  In  this  he  received  a</span><span>  nasty  bump  over  the  eye.</span><span>  Beaudesert  continued  to  win  the</span><span>  scrums,  securing  the  honours  in  ten  of</span><span>  the  first  13,  hut  the  ball  was  not  get</span><span>  ting  to  the  wingers  as  it  should  have</span><span>  been.  Crouch  attempted  a  field  goal</span><span>  from  an  easy  position,  but  it  missed,</span><span>  and  at  21  minutes  Woods'  kick  at  goal</span><span>  dropped  short.</span><span>  Several  free  kicks  gave  Beaudesert</span><span>  relief  when  they  had  their  backs  to</span><span>  their  line.  Bontoft  and  Veivers  on  one</span><span>  occasion  forced  their  way  through  by</span><span>  sheer  weight.  The  first  score  came</span><span>  after  29  minutes.  From  a  scrum  at</span><span>  Wynnum's  quarter,  the  ball  passed  out</span><span>  to  Wellington,  who  touched  down.</span><span>  Dauth  missed,  and  Beaudesert  led  3-0.</span><span>  Four  minutes  later  Sparks  ran  from</span><span>  the  quarter  way,  and  had  no  trouble</span><span>  in  scoring,  the  Beaudesert  players  mak</span><span>  ing  little  effort  to  stop  him.  Crouch</span><span>  missed,  and  at  half  time  the.  scores</span><span>  !  were  three  all.</span><span>  Soon  after  the  resumption  Day</span><span>  created  a  bright  spot  by  making  a  dash,</span><span>  but  he  had  to  throw  a  long  pass  to</span><span>  Freeman,  and  a  scrum  was  ordered.  It</span><span>  was  bad  luck  that  the  movement  suf</span><span>  fered  this  fate.  Beaudesert  was  well</span><span>  placed  from  several  scrums,  but  Ab</span><span>  berdan  knocked  on.  Weise  relieved  on</span><span>  one  occasion,  but  nobody  went  up  with</span><span>  him,  which  was  fortunate  for  Beaudes</span><span>  ert.  Wynnum  turned  on  spectacular</span><span>  football,  throwing  the  ball  about,  and</span><span>  ,  Beaudesert  saved  when  the  position</span><span>  looked  serious.</span><span>  Play  was  centred  near  half  way,  and</span><span>  Crust  broke  away  at  his  top.  He  had</span><span>  two  men  following  him,  and  he  real</span><span>  ised  that  they  were  close.  As  he  began</span><span>  to  ""slow  up""  he  changed  pace,  giving</span><span>  his  supporters  a  shock,  but  this  ap</span><span>  parently  had  the  effect  of  upsetting</span><span>  his  chasers  and  he  beat  them  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  line,  scoring  in  a  handy  position.  H</span><span>  was  great  work  ou  his  part.  He  nucl</span><span>  handled  a  diificu.t  situation  witn</span><span>  credit  for  so  young  a  piayer,  ana  ne</span><span>  deserved  the  cheers  that  it  Drought</span><span>  forth.  Dauth  made  no  mis.  nke,  and</span><span>  Beaudesert  red  8-3  alter  15  minutes.</span><span>  Beaudesert  nad  anything  but  charge</span><span>  of  the  game,  having  to  continually</span><span>  clear  its  line.  The  game  was  hard  and</span><span>  fast,  with  no  oeg  paruons.  McGovern.</span><span>  Bontoft  and  Deane  took  up,  but  the</span><span>  side  was  penalised.  Beaudesert  had  won</span><span>  11  of  the  15  scrums,  out  alter  that  the</span><span>  liomesiders  began  lo  gain  the  advan</span><span>  tage  in  tliis  regard.  Day  tried  to  get</span><span>  unings  moving,  and.  when  it  looked  as</span><span>  if  he  had  succeeded,  Blow  knocked  on.</span><span>  At  28  minutes  Beaudesert  took  a</span><span>  kick,  but  the  distance  for  McGovern</span><span>  was  too  great.  O'Brien  electrified  the</span><span>  crowd  by  kicking  ahead,  and  follow</span><span>  ing  on  at  his  top.  The  bounce  fav</span><span>  oured  him,  and  he  had  only  a  very</span><span>  confined  space  at  his  disposal,  and</span><span>  two  big  men  to  brat.  Undaunted,  he</span><span>  endeavoured  to  make  his  way</span><span>  through,  but  in  the  scuffle  he  lost  the</span><span>  ball.  It  was  a  great  effort.  In  the</span><span>  resultant  play  O'Brien  was  hurt.</span><span>  Several  five  yard  scrums  followed,</span><span>  and  Wynnum  cleared.</span><span>  Abberdan,  Blow  and  Deane  were  seen</span><span>  in  a  rush  that  made  up  much  ground.</span><span>  Five  minutes  of  play  remained,  and</span><span>  play  was  exciting  and  tense.  There  was</span><span>  a  delay  while  the  line  was  cleared.  At</span><span>  this  stage  Wynnum  was  attacking.  This</span><span>  extended  the  game,  as  also  a  delay</span><span>  when  Weise  suffered  a  i  lectured  ankle.</span><span>  When  Weise  went  down  Beaudesert</span><span>  was  battling  i.s  way  tlnougn  a  ,uck.</span><span>  One  linesman  reported  to  Referee</span><span>  Lewis  that  Weise  had  received  a  punch</span><span>  on  the  chest,  but,  although  ho  did  not</span><span>  think  this  correct,  uio  referee  had  to</span><span>  observe  the  ruling  m  .no  linesman.</span><span>  Beaudesert  was  penalised  several</span><span>  times,  and  Wynnum  clecvcd  to  put</span><span>  the  ball  into  the  air.  as  two  points  were</span><span>  of  no  value  to  them.  1  his  is  where  the</span><span>  forwards  came  in,  and  Dautli  proved</span><span>  an  inspiring  leader,  putting  as  much</span><span>  vigour  into  the  effort  as  lie  did  in  the</span><span>  early  stages.  Wellington  was  hurt  in</span><span>  one  mix-up,  and  was  very  slinky  when</span><span>  he  resumed.</span><span>  The  atmosphere  was  elect  ric,  and</span><span>  anything  could  have  happened  in  the</span><span>  last  few  minutes,  but  Beaudesert  had</span><span>  the  situation  reasonably  well  in  hand,</span><span>  even  though  they  had  a  do  or  die  on</span><span>  slaught  to  hold  up.</span><span>  Beaudesert  was  represented  by:  Full</span><span>  back,  L.

The  only  players  to</span><span>  show  anything  like  form  were  Peter</span><span>  Callanan,  in  the  backs,  and  T.  Murray</span><span>  in  the  forwards.  The  pivot  men  were</span><span>  weak  hi  defence,  and  attack,  and  W.</span><span>  Papworth,  who  went  to  the  full  back</span><span>  position,  got  his  side  in  a  lot  of  trouble.</span><span>  Defence,  generally  speaking,  was  con</span><span>  spicuous  by  its  absence.</span><span>  The  teams  wore:</span><span>  Beaudesert:  Full  back,  H.

When  Sandy  kicked  a</span><span>  goal,  Wynnum  led  14-4.  Brown  went</span><span>  over  and  from  a  movement,  that</span><span>  started  at  half  way  he  touched  down</span><span>  again  as  the  bell  rang.

While  these  players</span><span>  merit  special  mention  of  their  perform-</span><span>  â  ancts,  the  work  of  the  remainder  can</span><span>  not  be  too  liigntiy  commended.  How</span><span>  ever,  Colling  played  as  near  a  lault.ess</span><span>  game  as  it  is  possib.e  to  play,  although</span><span>  two  ""speculations""  did  not  seem  to  be</span><span>  the  product  oi  his  bag  of  competency.</span><span>  His  positional  kicking  was  worth  a</span><span>  lot  to  his  side,  and  he  worked  this  to</span><span>  advantage  when  Waterloos  ""  los.  D.</span><span>  Yuke,  their  lull  back,  after  about  22</span><span>  minutes  o  i  play.</span><span>  Panitz  showed  that  he  has  lost  none</span></p> <p><span>  of  ins  speed,  and  judgment,  and  his</span><span>  handling  was  satisfactory,  particularly</span><span>  when  it  is  considered  that  he  has</span><span>  been  a  grandstand  player  for  most  of</span><span>  the  season.  That  his  absence  was  a</span><span>  serious  loss  to  his  ciub,  and  Beaudesert</span><span>  football,  was  forcibly  brought  home  to</span><span>  spectators.  J.  Barrett,  who  only  came</span><span>  into  the  game  this  season,  and  learned</span><span>  the  game  in  tho  B  grade  ranks,  showed</span><span>  that  his  tutors  had  done  the  Job</span><span>  thoroughly,  because  he  showed  ability,</span><span>  plus  the  speed  that  he  had  before</span><span>  coaching  commenced.  In  scoring  -he</span><span>  showed  a  clean  pair  of  heels  to  the</span><span>  opposition.</span><span>  The  forwards  did  a  mighty  job.  The</span><span>  younger  and  lighter  men  in  D.</span><span>  Saunders,  T.  Murray  and  T.  Kassu'.ke</span><span>  stood  up  to  the  job  like  veterans,  and</span><span>  this  is  something  of  an  achievement</span><span>  after  handling  men  like  J.  Veivers</span><span>  and  G.  Bontoft.  who  take  some  stop</span><span>  ping,  and  are  deadly  in  defence.  Ca!-</span><span>  lanan  and  Dauth  were  in  It  for  all  they</span><span>  were  worth,  and  Little  showed  that  he</span><span>  is  on  the  improve,  using  his  physique</span><span>  to  better  advantage  than  previously.</span><span>  As  a  combination,  Beaudesert  for</span><span>  wards  did  better,  winning  15  scrums  to</span><span>  six  in  the  first  half,  with  11  to  13</span><span>  against  them  after  interval,  but  what</span><span>  Waterloos  lost-  in  scrummages,  they</span><span>  made  up  for  by  fast  breaking,  and  pin</span><span>  ning  of  the  opposition  pivots.  Day,  who</span><span>  possibly  played  his  best  halfback  game</span><span>  to  date,  was  given  little  room  to  move,</span><span>  and  E.  O'Brien,  chosen  to  take  five-</span><span>  eighth  when  nobody  else  was  available,</span><span>  took  some  bumps  -  and  in  saying  '  that</span><span>  it  did  not  detract  from  his  game.  It</span><span>  was  a  case  of  not  being  allowed  to  get</span><span>  moving.  Freeman's  defence  was  up  to</span><span>  the  mark,  and  Wellington  was  always</span><span>  a  worry  to  the  opposition.</span><span>  The  fact  that  Wellington,  Dauth,</span><span>  Crust  and  Saunders  played  in  Brisbane</span><span>  on  the  Saturday  had  to  be  taken  into</span><span>  consideration.</span></p> <p><span>  Veivers  and  Bontoft  led  the  others.</span><span>  G.  Ardrey,  having  nis  second  game  of</span><span>  the  afternoon,  dm  not  snow  it  at  times,</span><span>  and  it  is  a  pity  tnat  he  couid  not  have</span><span>  u  been  rested  ior  the  B  grade  game.  Hay-</span><span>  j>  lock  was  again  a  tower  ox  strengtn  to</span></p> <p><span>  J  his  side,  and  Crust  had  to  be  watched</span><span>  ;  in  the  open,  and  every  time  he  got</span><span>  I  the  bail  ior  that  matter.  Weeks  was</span><span>  L  stiff  in  his  movements,  and  confined</span><span>  ;  liis  activities  to  the  rucks  for  the  most</span><span>  J  part.</span><span>  G.  Sandy  moved  nicely  from  the</span><span>  C  scrum  at  times,  and  D.  Finglass  was</span><span>  C  always  on  the  move.  The  backs  were</span><span>  j  overshadowed  by  their  forwards,  who</span><span>  were  satisfied  to  make  it  that  way,  but</span><span>  !  just  the  same  they  did  turn  on  some</span><span>  J  snappy  passing  rushes.  Naturally  the</span><span>  j!  loss  of  Yuke  was  a  severe  one,  and</span><span>  upset  the  balance  of  the  back  division.</span><span>  ?  Referee  W.  Lewis  kept  the  game  at</span><span>  j  a  fast  rate,  and  on  several  occasions</span><span>  (  penalised  for  unnecessarily  rough  play,</span><span>  j!  although  there  was  some  heckling  from</span><span>  J""  a  section  of  the  crowd.  Some  of  their</span><span>  >  condemnation  of  alleged  offenders  was</span><span>  ?  not  justified  at  times,  but  that  is  part</span><span>  Ji  of  the  game.  In  the  closing  stages</span><span>  'i  Beaudesert  was  penalised  irequently,</span><span>  J  i  Waterloos  securing  eight  frees  for  the</span><span>  ,>  session,  against  four  against  them.  In</span><span>  i!  the  first  half  Beaudesert  received  nine</span><span>  frees,  and  Waterloos  six.</span><span>  Ji  There  was  a  good  attendance,  the</span><span>  i  public  contribution  being  Â£17/10/-.</span><span>  The  teams  were:</span><span>  i  Waterloos:  Full  back,  D.

Little.</span><span>  J  Six  minutes  after  the  kick  off  Water-</span><span>  loos  won  a  scrum  in  a  handy  position,</span><span>  Ji  and  a  passing  rush  finished  with  Crust</span><span>  touching  down.  Haylock  missed.</span><span>  J  Beaudesert  took  the  lead  five  min-</span><span>  i  utes  later.  A  move  started  near  half-</span><span>  'i  way  at  one  side  of  the  field,  and  tra</span><span>  il  versed  the  full  width,  for  Wellington  to</span><span>  ,i  dash  away.  After  20  yards  he  was</span><span>  i  J  hemmed  in,  but  he  in-passed  to  Panitz</span><span>  i  at  the  right  time,  and  that  player</span><span>  i  swung  in  to  score  a  great  try  at  the</span><span>  i  posts.  Dauth  did  the  rest.</span><span>  !'  Followed  a  period  of  scrappy  play,</span><span>  i  with  passing  bad,  but  tackling  hard</span><span>  1  1  and  effective.  At  14  minutes  Waterloos</span><span>  were  given  a  free  kick.  They  kicked</span><span>  Ji  the  bail  ahead,  and  a  long  one  was  re-</span><span>  p  turned  to  Sandy,  to  be  neatly  taken,</span><span>  i  J  He  started  his  forward  movement  mid-</span><span>  i  way  between  the  opposition  half  and</span><span>  quarter,  and  he  beat  all  those  who  tried</span><span>  Ji  to  stop  him.  It  was  a  remarkable  thing</span><span>  J  i  how  he  got  through,  and,  although  the</span><span>  i1  defence  must  be  criticised  the  scorer</span><span>  i  was  worthy  of  credit  for  his  determina-</span><span>  tion,  and  the  way  he  put  his  plan  into</span><span>  Ji  effect.  Crust  failed,  and  Waterloos  led</span><span>  J>  6-5.</span><span>  i1  Three  minutes  later  Dauth  missed  a</span><span>  i  fairly  easy  kick  at  goal,  and  after  the</span><span>  ),  game  had  been  in  progress  19  minutes</span><span>  Ji  he  took  a  long  one,  that  fell  a  lot</span><span>  i  short.  This  paved  the  way  for  another</span><span>  ij  score.  The  waterloos  taker  failed  to</span><span>  1,1  hold  the  ball  after  getting  It  Into  his</span></p> <p><span>  hands,  and  it  bounded  out  o.  piay.  A</span><span>  scrum  loliowed.  uay  secured  a  neatiy</span><span>  delivered  ball  from  the  hooker,  ana</span><span>  whipped  it  out  to  u'rsrien,  wno  s  iced</span><span>  his  way  tnrough  to  score  a  beauaiu.</span><span>  iry.  Dauth  made  no  mistake  ana  his</span><span>  side  ted  10-6.</span><span>  Th?  ball  was  kicked  olf,  and  Beau</span><span>  desert  was  over  again.  Six  players  had</span><span>  handled  before  the  ball  went  ;o  Bar</span><span>  rett.  He  just  evaded  Williams'  tackle</span><span>  as  he  made  the  corner.  Flags  were</span><span>  downed  to  Dauth.  .</span><span>  While  the  movement  was  going  on</span><span>  Yuke  was  lying  on  the  other  side  of  the</span><span>  lield.  He  had  to  be  carried  off  with  an</span><span>  injured  .'eft  ankle,  and  J.  Ferguson</span><span>  took  the  iie:d.  This  brought  about  a  re</span><span>  shuffle  of  the  Waterloo  side,  and  it  re</span><span>  sulted  in  Abberdan  going  to  the  custo</span><span>  dians  position.</span><span>  When  31  minutes  wore  showing</span><span>  Dauth  kicked  a  goal  from  a  difficult</span><span>  angle,  and  Beaudesrrl,  ltd  15-6.  This</span><span>  was  the  position'  for  six  minutes.  Beau</span><span>  desert  attacked  and  a  short,  one  was</span><span>  kicked  into  the  hands  oi  Paniiz.  He</span><span>  was  moving  forward,  and  was  soon  at</span><span>  his  top,  evading  Abberdan  to  register</span><span>  his  double.  Dauth  topped  n  off  with  a</span><span>  splendid  kick.  The  game  was  last  to  the</span><span>  interval,  when  Beaudescr;  led  20-6.</span><span>  Waterloos  took  ,  the  field  anything</span><span>  but  a  beaten  side.  They  had  a  further</span><span>  reorganisation  during  the  interval,  and</span><span>  Holding  found  hlmse'f  in  the  difficult</span><span>  position  oi  lull  back,  no  easy  one  with</span><span>  Collins  kicking  so  well.  The  game  was</span><span>  on  and  in  seven  minutes  Walerioos</span><span>  were  over.  They  had  handled  well,  wi.h</span><span>  Veivers  and  Blow  both  backing  up  in</span><span>  movements.  Finally  Veivers.  Blow  and</span><span>  Wibiams  went  away,  for  the  latter  to</span><span>  cross  out  wide.  Blow's  kick  was  a  great</span><span>  one,  and  the  winning  margin  fiad  been</span><span>  reduced  to  nine.</span><span>  Waterloos  were  playing  their  best</span><span>  fooiba.l,  and  at  this  stage  domineered</span><span>  the  situation,  knocking  at  tho  door  for</span><span>  ten  minute's.  Wliiie  anything  could</span><span>  have  happened,  Beaudesert  was  iust</span></p> <p><span>  able  to  stave  off  the  penetra.ing</span><span>  thrusts,  some  of  which  were  ruined  by</span><span>  bad  handling.</span><span>  The  next  Beaudescr,  try  was  a</span><span>  ""gift.""  Day  took  the  ball  from  the</span><span>  hands  of  Bontoft  when  piay  was  at  the</span><span>  Wa,  erloos'  quarter  line.  The  defenders</span><span>  were  caught  napping,  and  Day  sent</span><span>  Barrett  for  the  corner.  Dauth  failed.</span><span>  After  Holding  had  ini  tinted  a  move</span><span>  with  a  run  worthy  of  a  more  experi</span><span>  enced  fullback,  beating  hair  a  dozen</span><span>  players  in  the  process.  Ferguson  went</span><span>  close  to  doing  the  trick.  Veivers  re</span><span>  ceived  a  nasy  bump  on  the  top  of  his</span><span>  head,  and  had  to  receive  ambulance  at</span><span>  tention  that  kept  him  orr  the  field  for</span><span>  some  time.  Another  movement  sent</span><span>  Ferguson  over,  but  this  time  he  lost</span><span>  possession  of  the  ball.</span><span>  Wi  Ii  six  minutes  to  go  Beaudesert</span><span>  would  have  scored,  but  Wellington</span><span>  knocked  on.  A  scrum  fol'owed,  the  ball</span><span>  being  hooked  to  Day,  who  went  over</span><span>  on  his  own.  Dauth  was  in  form  and</span><span>  the  score  board  read  Beaudesert  28,</span><span>  Waterloos  11.</span><span>  With  a  minute  to  go  there  was  a</span><span>  scrum  on  the  Beaudesert  line,  and  the</span><span>  ball  traversed  the  Waterloos  back  line,</span><span>  for  Veivers,  who  was  making  an  extra</span><span>  back,  to  top  off  a  good  effort.  Blow</span><span>  missed,  and  the  final  score  was  Beau</span><span>  desert  28,  Waterloos  14.</span><span>  Waterloos  B  graders,  after  leading</span><span>  8-7  at  half  time,  went  on  to  win  21-12.</span><span>  .  With  15  minutes  to  go  Waterloos  had</span><span>  increased  their  lead  to  six  points,  scor</span><span>  ers  to  this  stage  being  N.  Currie,  two</span><span>  tries,  R.  Allen,  one  try,  and  Sandy  two</span><span>  goals  for  Waterloos.  Sammori  had</span><span>  scored  for  S.  Kassulke  to  convert,  and</span><span>  Peter  Callanan  had  kicked  a  goal  for</span><span>  Beaudesert.</span><span>  Beaudesert  reduced  I  lie  margin  to  a</span><span>  point  when  Sammon  scored  a  nice  try,</span><span>  and  Kassulke  again  came  to  light.  Play</span><span>  resumed  and  Waterloos  charged  down.</span><span>  E.  Ardrey,  at  his  top,  ran  to  an  advanc</span><span>  ing  Beaudesert  player  and  surprised  by</span><span>  tearing  the  leather  from  his  grasp,  and</span><span>  carrying  on  to  score.  N.  Sandy  con</span><span>  verted.</span><span>  N.

"<p><span>  Good  Racing  at  Beaudesert</span></p> <p><span>  Mmiry  was  freely  wagered  in  the  seven  races  deolucd  at  the  Kerry</span><span>  Church  Building  Fund  Race  Club  meeting  held,  at  tlilisibogaii  course</span><span>  on  Wednesday  afternoon,  and  some  big  wins,  also  -losses,  wen-  recorded</span><span>  on  the  afternoon.  S  -</span><span>  The  attendance  was  good,  the  gate  takings  not  fajtfng  far  short  of</span></p> <p><span>  Â£600.  On  this  occasion  there  were  68  bookmakers,  wlucjipis  not  as  great</span><span>  as  at  other  meetings  in  recent  times,  and  there  tendency  to</span><span>  make  the  races  open,  and  not  concentrate,  as  lias  ofjien  happened.  .</span><span>  The  meeting  was  well  carried  out,  although  a  little  time,  was  lost</span><span>  when  a  horse  played  up,  and  released  llic  barrier  a-dumlier  of  times.</span><span>  Most  of  tills  was  made  up  later  in  the  afternoon.  The'  stewards  were</span><span>  busy  after  the  meeting  sorting  out  the  right  from.'vjle  wrong  when</span><span>  there  were  complaints  hy  punters  that  tickets  held  by-llicm  were  not</span><span>  for  tlic  horses  they  had  named  when  wagering.  Evidence  of  all  (he</span><span>  parties  involved  was  taken  before  decisions  were  ma#e.</span></p> <p><span>  The  best  field  of  the  day  was  the</span><span>  Sixth  Division  when  14  faced  the  bar</span><span>  rier.  Had  another  of  the  18  acceptors</span><span>  not  scratched  on  the  course  it  would</span><span>  have  been  necessary  to  divide  the</span><span>  event.  The  Fourth  Division  had  only</span><span>  drawn  five  acceptors,  and  they  all</span><span>  started,  and  made  a  good  race  of  it.</span><span>  That  the  race  for  maiden  horses  was-</span><span>  appreciated  was  evident  by  the  faet-</span><span>  that  ten  started  in  it.</span><span>  The  track  was  in  good  condition,  and</span><span>  the  appointments  generally  were  up  to</span><span>  standard.  The  organisation  behind  the</span><span>  posting  of  jockeys  on  the  semaphore</span><span>  was  up  to  the  mark,  the  changes  being</span><span>  made  while  each  field  was  at  the  bar</span><span>  rier.  This  allowed'  bookmakers  and</span><span>  punters  plenty  of  time  to  prepare  for</span><span>  the  succeeding  race.</span><span>  Entries  for  the  first  race,  the  First</span><span>  Division  of  the  Hack  Handicap,  in</span><span>  cluded  Harold  Ludwig's  Rivopal,  who</span><span>  was  top  weighted  at  10.10,  George</span><span>  Dyer's  Solwong,  and  Dave  Grennan's</span><span>  David's  First.  When  betting  settled</span><span>  down,  as  much  as  fives  were  called</span><span>  about  Rivopal,  and  sixes  Solwong,  but</span><span>  the  latter-  drifted  to  tens  when  the</span><span>  Ludwig  stable,  which  also  shelters  Sol</span><span>  wong,  went  for  Rivopal.</span><span>  Karkil  was  always  favourite  at  about</span><span>  twos,  and  Rivopal  went  out  at  5  to  2.</span><span>  Rivopal  got  away  badly,  and  was  lying</span><span>  second  last  after  they  had  covered</span><span>  a  furlong.  She  made  up  ground  at  the</span><span>  back  of  the  straight,  but  the  heavy</span><span>  weight  told  on  her,  and  she  was  hard</span><span>  '  pushed  to  get  third  place  by  a  small</span><span>  margin  from  Solwong.  Ncroform,  who</span><span>  .  started  at  fours,  led  all  the  way,  after</span><span>  :  having  an  advantage  of  four  lengths</span><span>  at  the  furlong  peg.  L.  Hone,  on  Karkil,</span><span>  :  lodged  '  a  protest  against  the  winner.</span><span>  |  Hone  told  the  stewards  that  he  ran</span><span>  ;  to  \  the  leader  at  the  home  turn,  and</span><span>  :  the  winner  took  him  off  the  track.  For</span><span>  the  last  half  furlong  Neroform  was</span><span>  :  lying  on  him,  and  bore  him  out.</span><span>  :  Mr.  J.  J.  Lynch  (Chief  Steward)  :  Are</span><span>  you  quite  sure?</span><span>  :  Hone:  Yes.</span><span>  |  There  were  no  questions.</span><span>  :  S.  Lawlor,  owner  of  Karkil,  said  that</span><span>  :  he  noticed  the  horse  go  out  wide,  and</span><span>  he  thought  he  was  pushed  out.</span><span>  Jockey  Stepheas  said  that  from  the</span><span>  turn  he  was  in  front  all  the  time.  He</span><span>  did  not  touch  Hone's  horse.</span><span>  Lawlor  said  he  thought  his  horse</span><span>  was  in  front  into  the  straight.</span><span>  The  protest  was  dismissed,  and  Hone</span><span>  was  fined  Â£5  for  making  a  frivolous</span><span>  protest.</span><span>  The  failure  of  Rivopal  was  offset</span><span>  somewhat  for  the  Ludwig  stable  when</span><span>  Harold's  Pride  won  the  Second  Divi</span><span>  sion  of  the  Hack  for  them  after  a</span><span>  hard  race  with  Macassar.  Harold's</span><span>  Pride  -  started  'at  eights',""  '  and-""""  after'</span><span>  being  shorter.  Macassar  drifted  to  that</span><span>  price  with  Peter  Morgan's  mount,  Lord</span><span>  Linden,  backed  to  6  to  4.</span><span>  Macassar  was  smartest  away,  and</span><span>  Harold's  Pride  soon  raced  into  second</span><span>  position,  to  be  a  neck  worse  at  the  two</span><span>  furlongs.  Macassar  had  a  slight  ad</span><span>  vantage  at  the  home  turn,  but  the</span><span>  local  Iiorse  was  hi  charge  when  they</span><span>  straightened  up.  Harold's  Pride  was</span><span>  under  pressure  over  the  final  distance,</span><span>  and  a  last  burst  by  Macassar  was  not</span><span>  good  enough  and  he  went  down  by</span><span>  a  short  head.  It  was  a  great  finish.</span><span>  This  gave  the  Ludwig  followers  the</span><span>  second  leg  of  their  double.  A  win  by</span><span>  Rivopal  would  have  meant  them  taking</span><span>  out  a  big  packet  of  money.</span><span>  There  was  money  for.  everything  in</span><span>  the  Fifth  Division,  except  My  Chavo,</span><span>  who  started  at  20  to  1.  Prince  Charles</span><span>  had  a  big  following,  and  started  at</span><span>  7  to  4,  with  West  Tor  next  in  demand.</span><span>  The  latter  took  charge  at  the  home</span><span>  turn,  and  went  on  to  win  by  two</span><span>  lengths,  with  a  like  distance  from</span><span>  Prince  Charles  to  Temperance.  The</span><span>  start  was  delayed  by  My  Chavo,  who</span><span>  went  through  the  bander  several</span><span>  times.</span><span>  Punters  were  on  the  job  in  the</span><span>  Maiden  Handicap,  of  5  furlongs,  when</span></p> <p><span>  they  ""dobbed""  it  on  Pothinius  in  big</span><span>  lumps,  and  had  the  pleasure  of  seeing</span><span>  the  three  year  old  gelding  win,  almost</span><span>  from  barrier  to  box,  by  two  and.  a  half</span><span>  lengths,  from  the  five  to  one  Impel,</span><span>  with  Mark  Cup,  who  was  equal  second</span><span>  favourite  with  Gold  Mint  at  fours,</span><span>  third.</span><span>  The  field  of  five  in  the  Fourth  Divi</span><span>  sion,  of  six  furlongs,  made  a  good  race</span><span>  of  it.  For  the  greater  part  of  the  dis</span><span>  tance,  the  7  to  4  favourite,  Marnbuz,</span><span>  ridden  by  Ashley  Burgess,  led  slightly</span><span>  from  Mazerib.  There  was  little  between</span><span>  them  as  they  entered  the  straight,  and</span><span>  then  Boston  came  from  behind,  and</span><span>  found  an  opening  between  them.  Bur</span><span>  gess  had  his  mount  well  in  hand,  and</span><span>  he  threw  off  the  strong  challenge  from</span><span>  the  fast  finishing  Boston,  and  came</span><span>  again  to  have  three-quarters  of  a</span><span>  length  to  spare.  ,</span><span>  The  Sixth  Division,  Of  five  furlongs,</span><span>  provided  a  great  finish,  a  blanket  being</span><span>  sufficient  to  cover  the  first  nine  of</span><span>  the  field  of  14,  with  the  remainder</span><span>  handy.  Any  of  about  eight  could  have</span><span>  won  as  they  raced  up  the  straight,  and</span><span>  as  they  crossed  the  line  the  5  to  2  bot</span><span>  tom  weight,  Silk  King,  had  a  short</span><span>  head  over  Wiseone.  with  a  like  dis</span><span>  tance  to  The  Orne.  with  Incitatus  just</span><span>  beaten  for  the  third  place.  It  was  a</span><span>  finish  that  nobody  would  appreciate</span><span>  the  job  of  judging,  so  close  was  it.</span><span>  Hedacky,  who  was  sent  out  a  5  to  2</span><span>  favourite  for  the  Seventh  Division,</span><span>  came  with  a  great  burst  in  the  straight</span><span>  to  win  by  a  length  and  a  half.  New</span><span>  Bint  and  Lancelot  made  all  the  going,</span><span>  with  the  winner  nicely  placed  and  the</span><span>  former  had  his  nose  in  front  when</span><span>  they  hit  the  straight.  Gold  Mint  fol</span><span>  lowed  the  winner  in,  and  the  early</span><span>  leaders  fought  it  out  for  third  place,</span><span>  Lancelot  getting  toppled  by  a  head.</span><span>  Results:</span><span>  Handicap  Hack  Race  (First  Divi</span><span>  sion),  5  furs.:  NEROFORM  7.7,  71b.  al</span><span>  low  (N.

"<p><span>  Future  Beaudesert  Developments  j</span></p> <p><span>  The  future  development  of  Beaudesert  was  discussed  at  (lie  monthly</span><span>  meeting  of  the  Beaudesert  Shire  Council  on  Tuesday,  and  reference</span><span>  was  made  to:</span><span>  The  possible  provision  of  municipal  owned  Kaleyards,  or</span><span>  at  least  life  exclusion  of  salcyards  from  the  town  area.</span></p> <p><span>  The  control  of  inflammable  materials.</span><span>  Opening  of  a  new  stock  route,  by  resuming  land  so  that</span><span>  Albert  Street  can  be  closed.  when  the  work  of  filling  in  the</span><span>  town  side  of  Spring  Creek  is  commenced  under  the  Â£2000</span><span>  scheme  the  council  is  putting  into  operation  Willi  a  view  to</span><span>  providing  a  park  area.</span><span>  A  town  planning  scheme  to  control  types  of  business  that  could  be</span><span>  conducted  within  the  town  area  was  also  mentioned  at  the  meeting.</span><span>  Reasons  for  the  suggestion  to  have  salcyards  built  other  than  in  the</span><span>  town  area  were  that  travelling  stock  are  doing  damage  to  the  streets,</span><span>  particularly  in  wet  weather,  and  that  the  present  town  stock  routes  are</span><span>  through  areas  that  arc  fast  becoming  popular  residential  area's.</span><span>  Four  residents  of  Jane  Street  asked  â</span></p> <p><span>  for  work  on  that  street  to  give  them</span><span>  access.</span><span>  Clr.  J.  Aldridge  said  the  street  was</span><span>  in  a  deplorable  state.  The  trouble  was</span><span>  that  90  per  cent,  of  the  cattle  going  to</span><span>  the  sale  yards  used  that  street,  and</span><span>  most  of  them  were  driven  back  that</span><span>  way.  He  feared  that  it  would  be  waste</span><span>  of  time  building  the  road  because  as</span><span>  soon  as  it  rained  the  cattle  would  cut</span><span>  it  up.</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridge  said  that  once  they</span><span>  started  straightening  Spring  Creek</span><span>  they  would  have  to  build  a  'bridge</span><span>  across  Albert  Street,  and  this  would</span><span>  cost  Â£760.  He  thought  the  time  would</span><span>  come  when  they  would  have  to  do</span><span>  something  about  having  the  yards</span><span>  moved  out  of  town.  It  was  rather  a  big</span><span>  question.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  could  not  see  much  use</span><span>  spending  money  on  the  street  under</span><span>  the  present  conditions.</span><span>  Mr.  A.  L.  Lane  (Shire  Clerk)  said</span><span>  that  at  the  last  meeting  the  question  of</span><span>  the  control  of  the  police  reserve  had</span><span>  arisen.  As  a  resu't  of  what  transpired</span><span>  he  wrote  the  following  letter  to  the</span><span>  Land  Administration  Board:  On</span><span>  November  28,  1942,  reserve  R285,  por</span><span>  tion  75  Beaudesert,  was  gazetted  as  a</span><span>  reserve  for  prison.  The  council  antici</span><span>  pates  that  before  long  there'  will  be</span><span>  difficulties  regarding  the  accommoda</span><span>  tion  for  cattle  sales.  At  the  present</span><span>  time  all  sales  are  conducted  within  the</span><span>  town  area  and  cause  considerable  in</span><span>  convenience  and  damage  to  streets  by</span><span>  the  driving  of  cattle  to  and  from  these</span><span>  yards,  as  large  numbers  of  cattle  are</span><span>  sold  here  each  -fortnight.  It  Is  desired</span><span>  to  establish  yards  outside  the  town</span><span>  with  provision  for  drafting  mobs  on,</span><span>  and  as  the  above  reserve  is  adjacent</span><span>  to  the  stock  route  to  Brisbane,  consid</span><span>  eration  is  requested  In  having  this  re</span><span>  serve  made  availab'e  as  a  stockyard  re</span><span>  serve.  If  the  Minister  cannot  see  his</span><span>  way  clear  to  grant  the  whole  of  this</span><span>  reserve  the  eastern  portion  of  about  50</span><span>  acres  would  be  suitable  for  the  pur</span><span>  pose.</span><span>  Mr.  Lane  said  there  was  no  reply  to</span><span>  his  letter.</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridge:  That  is  a  very  thought</span><span>  ful  letter.</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridge  said  that  If  anything</span><span>  was  done  to  Jane  Street  he  would  like</span><span>  to  see  the  roadway  made  on  one  side,</span><span>  with  the  catt'e  restricted  to  the  other.</span><span>  Mr.  J.  S.  Cochrane  (Engineer)  said</span><span>  that  he  could  not  see  what  could  be</span><span>  done.  The  street  had  been  graded  a</span><span>  number  of  times.  They  could  not  do</span><span>  anything  permanent  while  the  cattle</span><span>  were  using  it.</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridge:  I  rode  along  it  the</span><span>  other  Sunday,  and  I  am  sure  nobody</span><span>  could  get  through  in  a  car.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  forecast  development  of</span><span>  the  street  for  residential  purposes.</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridge  asked  If  they  could</span><span>  close  the  street  as  a  stock  route,  and</span><span>  shift  the  saleyards.</span><span>  Clr.  Stephens  said  the  best  place  for</span><span>  the  yards  was  on  the  other  side  of  the</span><span>  town  and  Clr.  Aldridge  agreed.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley:  Wherever  yards  are</span><span>  built  they  will  have  to  have  the  ap</span><span>  proval  of  the  council,  and  new  yards</span><span>  will  be  built  soon.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  they  could  advise</span><span>  the  Show  Society  of  the  difficulty  of</span><span>  maintaining  town  streets,  due  to  their</span><span>  use  on  sale  days,  and  suggest  the  yards</span><span>  be  shifted  out  of  town,  possibly  to  Eel-</span><span>  boean.</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridtre:  The  matter  will  be</span><span>  discussed  at  the  next  Show  Committee</span><span>  meeting.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  if  they  secured  some</span><span>  of  the  police  reserve  there  was  nothing</span><span>  to  say  that  they  could  not  build  yards</span><span>  and  hire  them  for  sales.</span><span>  Other  speakers  said  this  was  done</span><span>  elsewhere.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  the  time  had  come</span><span>  when  thev  would  have  to  control  the</span><span>  stock  yards.</span><span>  Clr.  P.  V.  Campbell:  Sooner  or  later</span><span>  the  cattle  will  have  to  be  kept  off  the</span><span>  Three  Mile  Lane.</span><span>  C'r.  Aldridge:  Cemetery  Road  allot</span><span>  ments  will  he  built  on  shortly.</span><span>  C'r.  p.  v.  Campbe'l  said  that  in</span><span>  N.SW.  there  was  hardly  anv  stockyards</span></p> <p><span>  in  the  towns,</span><span>  Clr.  B.  A.  Ferguson  said  an  advan</span><span>  tage  oi  Eeloogan  was  there  was  water</span><span>  mere.  .  .</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridge:  Everything  is  in  fav</span><span>  our  of  that  area..'.</span><span>  Cir.  E.  M.  Tiiley  asked  if  it  was  a</span><span>  good  idea  that  the  authorities  should</span><span>  contemplate  building  a  prison  at  Eel-</span><span>  bogan.  Â«</span><span>  Others  said  that  they  did  not  think</span><span>  that  the  authorities  had  tn:u  in  mind.</span><span>  Horses  were  spelled  there.</span><span>  The  action  of;  Mr.  Lane  in  writing</span><span>  the  letter  was  endorsed.</span><span>  Members  of  N&  5  Division  with  Mr.</span><span>  Cochrane  are  to.  inspect  Jane  Street</span><span>  and  the  Show  Society  and  Messrs.  M.</span><span>  S.  Smith  and  Spn  arc  to  be  advised</span><span>  of  what  the  council  has  in  mind.</span><span>  Later  in  the-  meeting  the  following</span><span>  statement  on  the  Spring  Creek  pro</span><span>  posal  by  Mr.  Cochrane  was  tabled:</span><span>  ""The  straightening  of  400  ft.  up</span><span>  stream  across  Albert  Street  will  cost</span><span>  as  per  estimate-,  Â£1341,  to  excavate  and</span><span>  spread  the  material.  To  provide  a</span><span>  bridge  across  tli&lt;$  channel  will  require</span><span>  1/44'  and  2/17!?iS!jans  with  a  roadway</span><span>  of  12ft.,  and  thEjiwU)  be  on  a  ,25  de</span><span>  gree  skew  oh  account  of  the  angle  of</span><span>  me  street  to  the  channel.  The  esti</span><span>  mated  cost  is  Â£760.  Whether  the  bridge</span><span>  is  necessary  depends  somewhat  on  the</span><span>  decision  as  to  the  final  location  of  the</span><span>  cattle  sale  yards,  It  is  also  doubtful</span><span>  if  a  full  subsidy  will  be  granted  for</span><span>  this  bridge.""</span><span>  Cir.  Henley  said  that  at  the  mo</span><span>  ment  he  did  not  see  they  were  under</span><span>  any  obligation  to  do  the  Â£760  job.  He</span><span>  was  more  inclined  to  open  a  new  stock</span><span>  route  after  they  saw  what  happened  in</span><span>  regard  the  new  saleyards.  He  was  in</span><span>  clined  to  go  ahead  with  straightening</span><span>  the  creek  above  Albert  Street.</span><span>  To  Clr.  Aldridge,  Mr.  Cochrane  said</span><span>  a  better  proposal  would  be  to  resume</span><span>  a  stock  route,  and  pack  up  the  creek</span><span>  crossing  with  stone.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  they  could  then</span><span>  close  Albert  Street.</span><span>  Mr.  Cochrane  said  the  creek  scheme</span><span>  was  tied  up  with  the  cattle  yards.  He</span><span>  thought  it  was  obvious  that  they  would</span><span>  have  to  open  another  street,  whatever</span><span>  happened  to  the  yards.</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridgc:  If  we  build  that  bridge</span><span>  it  will  be  used  by  cattle  only.</span><span>  Clr.  Davis  said  that  the  council  had</span><span>  a  big  bridge  building  plan,  and  many</span><span>  bridges  had  to  be  built.</span><span>  Mr.  Cochrane  said  cattle  could  not</span><span>  use  Albert  Street  without  a  bridge  as</span><span>  there  would  be  a  drain  8ft.

Murray  and  Dauth  charged</span><span>  !  down  on  him,  the  former  picking  up</span><span>  ,  with  everything  set  for  a  scoring  run,</span><span>  i  but  he  stumbled  and  fell  over.  Murray</span><span>  i  sent  the  leather  back,  but  the  opening</span><span>  1  had  been  lost.  Murray  came  to  light</span><span>  !  again,  and  started  a  move  that  put</span><span>  '  Wellington  on  'his  way.  Wellington  cut</span><span>  'i  in,  and,  in  the  tackle,  lost  the  ball,  and</span><span>  1  what  looked  like  a  try.</span><span>  ,i  Creeks  were  defending  solidly,  as  the</span><span>  2  opposition  was  putting  everything  Into</span><span>  tne  game.  F.  Callanan  scooped  the  loose</span></p> <p><span>  ball  up  nicely,  and  Uauiuters  iot.owcd</span><span>  on  tne  good  work.</span><span>  Biigli.  was  now  playing  lullback  for</span><span>  his  side,  with  Davis  on  the  wing,</span><span>  H.amders  was  making  an  ext.a  baeii.</span><span>  Wellington  and  F.  Callanun  trans-</span><span>  ieired  piay  from  ball  way.  the  former</span><span>  running  quarter  of  the  length  of  the</span><span>  xieid.  There  was  soma  scrambling  play,</span><span>  and  Wellington  received,  and,  swerving</span><span>  around  opposition  players  without  any</span><span>  trouble,  lie  got  over  m  tiie  corner.</span><span>  Dauth  tailed,  and.  after  ten  minutes</span><span>  Beaudesert  led  9-3.</span><span>  It  appeared  that  ibis  had  put  the</span><span>  issue  beyond  doubt,  on  the  state  of  tho</span><span>  game  to  this  stage,  but  Creeks  showed</span><span>  that,  they  were  prepared  to  come  back.</span><span>  Beaudesert  was  penalised  when  Ref.</span><span>  Hayes  said  to  a  player  ""Don't  trip  a</span><span>  man.""  Immediately  after  there  was  a</span><span>  happening  when  ii  was  claimed  that</span><span>  Creeks  should  have  been  penalised  lor</span><span>  an  illegal  charge,  and  then  Beaudesert</span><span>  retu.iaied.  Both  the  la  tcr  incidents  es</span><span>  caped  the  notice  ol  the  referee,  and  the</span><span>  linesman  nearest  let.  them  pass  over.</span><span>  Beaudesert  continually  iniringed,  and</span><span>  in  the  first  15  minutes  of  this  half  had</span><span>  six  free  kicks  awarded  agains:.  them,  to</span><span>  one  in  their  favour.</span><span>  For  a  few  minute.:  Creeks  domineered</span><span>  play,  but,  like  a  flush,  Beaudesert  was</span><span>  oil'  again  for  O'Brien  to  cross  well  out.</span><span>  S.  Callanan  failed.</span><span>  Collins  was  behind  the  pack,  and  he</span><span>  was  getting  more  ol  the  ball  than  the</span><span>  opposition  at  this  si  I'se.  Front  a  scrum</span><span>  near  half  way  Creel:  won.  and  tho  ball</span><span>  went  along  the  line,  sykes  passed  to</span><span>  Deane,  and  was  tin  &lt;:  to  take  the  in-</span><span>  pass,  and  finish  under  the  posts.  Deane</span><span>  missed  a  sitter,  and  after  22  minutes</span><span>  Beaudesert  led  12-6.</span><span>  The  town  team  continually  fed</span><span>  O'Brien,  and  he  was  running  with  de</span><span>  termination.  His  side  lost  a  great  op</span><span>  portunity  when  it  was  penalised  for</span><span>  offside  piay.</span><span>  Dauth  took  a  kick  at  goal  at,  29  min</span><span>  utes,  and  the  ball  bit  the  crossbar  and</span><span>  bounced  back.  Creeks  cleared,  and</span><span>  lodged  an  onslaught  that  was  soon</span><span>  ruined  by  ragged  play  on  their  part.</span><span>  Wellington  received,  when  there  was  a</span><span>  great  opening""  in  front  of  lfim.  but  he</span><span>  slowed  up,  apparent  I-.-  to  allow  his  sup</span><span>  ports  come  up  with  him,  and  the</span><span>  chance  was  lost.  It  seemed  that  with</span><span>  liis  pace,  Wellington  should  have  gone</span><span>  on  his  own.</span><span>  Both  sides  were  showing  strains  of</span></p> <p><span>  i/ijc  wucii  uii  nimuies  oi  piay</span><span>  remained,  but  Creeks  made  a  last  effort</span><span>  to  reduce  the  map/in  against  them.</span><span>  There  were  a  series  ol  scrums  on  Beau-</span><span>  desert's  line,  and  this  was  followed  by</span><span>  a  dreary  exchange  of  kicking,  which</span><span>  did  not  help  Creeks  bv  any  means.</span><span>  They  were  ""behind.""  and  thev  were  up</span><span>  against  more  expei  kneed  men  in  the</span><span>  kicking  line.</span><span>  Swinging  into  m  i  ion.

This  was  due  to  bad  handling.</span><span>  :  In  the  early  stages  it  appeared  that  the  visitors  might  hold  their</span><span>  :  own,  Beaudesert  having  some  uneasy  moments,  and  even  when  South</span><span>  Coast  had  been  routed,  with  the  home  team  comfortably  in  front,</span><span>  :  the  players  could  not  finish  off  movements  that  would  have  resulted</span><span>  '  in  many  more  points  being  added.</span></p> <p><span>  '  Id  was  a  case  of  the  forwards  win-</span><span>  J  ning  the  day.  Although  Dauth  and</span><span>  4  Bontoft  were  outstanding,  they  were</span><span>  ovL-rsnudowed  by  Callanan,  who  was</span><span>  sen  at  his  best.  He  backed  up  repeat-</span><span>  1  tdly,  and  was  a  valuable  ruckhaif.</span><span>  J  McGovern,  who  fl  led  the  vacancy  left</span><span>  ,  Veivers  showed  bet.er  form  than  that</span><span>  of  several  weeks  ago,  and  Crust  was</span><span>  &lt;  not  the  breakaway  that  he  has  been.</span><span>  '  His  standing  off  the  serum  was  claimed</span><span>  J  by  some  to  have  upset  the  machinery</span><span>  ,  of  the  back  division,  but  that  should</span><span>  1  not  have  been  the  case  because  the</span><span>  1  players  in  those  positions  were  not</span><span>  strangers  to  one  another.</span><span>  J  Day  was  as  hard  a  worker  as  ever,  but</span><span>  tried  to  run  too  much,  instead  of  getting</span><span>  ,  the  ball  away  from  the  fast  breaking</span><span>  1  opposition  forwards.  Deane  had  the</span><span>  '  worst  day  he  has  had  for  many  a</span><span>  '  game,  handling  and  running  badly.  This</span><span>  ,  was  not  typical  of  Deane  by  any  means.</span><span>  ,  Freeman  earned  his  place  for  his</span><span>  1  defensive  work  alone,  his  tackling  being</span><span>  >  solid  and  effective.

Wellington  was  a  marked</span><span>  man,  and  was  always  crowded.  He  had</span><span>  no  chance  of  getting  away,  so  closely</span><span>  was  he  guarded  for  the  greater  part</span><span>  1  01  the  game.</span><span>  '  O'Brien  saved  his  side  no  end  of</span><span>  ,  trouble,  turning  on  a  performance  that</span><span>  wou  d  have  done  credit  to  many  far</span><span>  1  more  experienced  fullbacks.  His  hand</span><span>  ling  rarely  let  him  down,  and  his</span><span>  '  placements  were  valuable,  not  to</span><span>  mention  the  ground  that  he  made  up</span><span>  by  following  on  fast  to  take  advantage</span><span>  of  his  kicks.</span><span>  It  was  a  pity  that  the  whole  per</span><span>  formance  of  the  Beaudesert  side  was</span><span>  ruined  by  lack  of  finish,  because  their</span><span>  victory  would  have  been  something  to</span><span>  enthuse  about.</span><span>  1  South  Coast  players  were  always  on</span><span>  '  the  game,  their  forwards  spotting  very</span><span>  well.  They  had  to  be  because  in  the</span><span>  1  first  half  Beaudesert  won  17  of  the  27</span><span>  effective  scrums.  They  made  amends</span><span>  1  in  the  second  half  by  more  than  taking</span><span>  '  their  share,  the  figures  being  17-11.</span><span>  Beaudesert  received  ten  Iree  kicks</span><span>  to  six  against  them  in  the  first  half,</span><span>  1  and,  after  the  interval,  it  was  4-3  their</span><span>  1  way.</span><span>  1  While  Dauth  was  in  form  with  his</span><span>  |  goalkicking,  taking  several  difficult</span><span>  ,  angles  with  success,  Blow,  who  was</span><span>  -  given  many  of  the  other  freekicks,  did</span><span>  not  Use  his  line  to  advantage,  anrl</span></p> <p><span>  worked  his  forwards  unnecessarily  in</span><span>  this  regard.  It  Is  a  fault  that  has  not</span><span>  been  rectified  in  several  inter-league</span><span>  games,  and  should  not  escape  atten</span><span>  tion  prior  to  the  final.</span><span>  The  teams  were:  Beaudesert:  Full</span><span>  back:  E.

McKenzie,  S.  Reeves,  J.</span><span>  Guinea.</span><span>  Mr.  F.  Jacobson  was  In  charge  of  the</span><span>  whis'le.</span><span>  Beaudesert  set  the  ball  in  motion,</span><span>  but,  wi'hin  three  minutes  South  Coast</span><span>  had  registered,  a  long  kick,  well  out.</span><span>  by  Cheers  raising  the  flags.  In  the  first</span><span>  five  minutes  the  visitors  had  been  given</span><span>  four  free  kicks  to  one  against  them,</span><span>  Cheers  missing  another  shot.</span><span>  Beaudesert  was  under  pressure,  but</span><span>  a  passing  movement  transferred  play</span><span>  to  half  way.  When  play  had  been  In</span><span>  progress  17  minutes,  Dauth  equalised</span><span>  from  a  long  kick  in  front  of  the  posts.</span></p> <p><span>  Again  Beaudesert  was  called  011  to</span><span>  deiend,  but  the  players  seemed  to  be</span><span>  all  at  sea,  with  weak  attempts  to  stop</span><span>  nlnvers  nr  nn  mnvA  trÂ»  Ih-aqIt  im  mmro.</span></p> <p><span>  ments.  At  20  minutes  Hanley  sent</span><span>  Pearson  away,  and  he  scored  beside</span><span>  the  posts.  Cheers  made  no  mistake,</span><span>  and  iris  side  led  7-2.</span><span>  South  Coast  took  up  again,  and  Mel</span><span>  rose  went  for  the  corner  at  his  top  to</span><span>  be  charged,  which  put  him  out  of</span><span>  bounds,  and  out  of  commission  for</span><span>  some  minutes.  Again  Beaudesert's  de</span><span>  fence  was  weak.</span><span>  Callanan  sent  Wellington  down  the</span><span>  line,  and  he  was  forced  out  at  the  op</span><span>  position  quarter.  Further  ground  was</span><span>  made  up  by  slinging  the  ball  about.</span><span>  Bontoft  charged  through  the  ruck,  and</span><span>  then  followed  a  tussle  on  the  line.  Sev</span><span>  eral  players  went  close  to  scoring,  but</span><span>  fell  inches  short.  The  ball  was  heeled</span><span>  to  McGovern,  who  saw  an  opening,  and</span><span>  dived  over.  Dauth  brought  off  a  beau</span><span>  tiful  kick,  and,  at  27  minutes,  the</span><span>  score  was  level  at  seven  all,</span><span>  Beaudesert  was  all  set  for  another</span><span>  try,  with  three  men  over,  but  the</span><span>  leather  was  knocked  on  from  a  ""lolly-</span><span>  pop""  pass.  At  32  minutes  Dauth  missed</span><span>  a  long  one.</span><span>  With  five  minutes  to  half  time,  Beau</span><span>  desert  won  a  scrum  in  a  handy  position,</span><span>  and  the  ball  traversed  the  quarterline</span><span>  to  finish  up  with  Sykes,  who  secured</span><span>  the  -honours.  The  kick  was  a  long  one,</span><span>  but  Dauth  was  equal  to  it.</span><span>  Just  on  time  Cheers  missed  a  long</span><span>  kick,  and  his  side  followed  on.  After  a</span><span>  scrum  South  Coast  had  two  good  open</span><span>  ings  when  Beaudesert  stood  listlessly</span><span>  about,  but  they  did  not  avail  of  them.</span><span>  On  the  resumption  Sykes  and  Crust</span><span>  made  up  ground,  but  a  forward  held  up</span><span>  the  movement.  At  ten  minutes  Dreyer</span><span>  scored  out  wide,  after  running  from</span><span>  the  quarterway.  Cheers  failed,  and</span><span>  Beaudesert  was  12-10  in  front.</span><span>  A  minute  later  Beaudesert  was  given</span><span>  a  free  kick  on  the  quarter  line  not  far</span><span>  from  the  centre  of  the  field,  and  Dauth</span><span>  raised  tile  flogs.</span><span>  The  ball  was  kicked  to  O'Brien,  who</span><span>  took  It  at  his  top,  and  ran  up  as  far</span><span>  as  he  could  before  shortkicking  over</span><span>  the  heads  of  the  opposition.  He  re</span><span>  trieved,  but  a  five  yard  scrum  was</span><span>  ordered.  There  were  several  scrums,</span><span>  which  were  followed  by  determined</span><span>  play  on  the  line.  Sykes  received  out</span><span>  wide,  and  should  nave  gone  for  the</span><span>  comer,  but  did  not.  Finally  South</span><span>  Coast  cleared,  and  O'Brien  knocked  on,</span><span>  with  an  infringement  in  the  subsequent</span><span>  scrum,  which  lost  ground.</span><span>  Beaudesert's  next  try  was  the  result</span><span>  of  good  work  on  the  part  of  the  for</span><span>  wards.  Dauth  started  off,  and  beat</span><span>  several  opposition  players  before  trans</span><span>  ferrins  to  Callanan,  who  was  up  with</span><span>  him.  Then  McGovern  received  and</span><span>  carried  on,  to  touch  down  under  the</span><span>  posts.  Dauth  topped  off  a  grand  effort,</span><span>  and  Beaudesert  led  19-10.</span><span>  Cal'anan  and  Crust  were  seen  in</span><span>  another  forward  move,  and  Reeves  was</span><span>  .  off  the  field  for  some  minutes  after  -</span><span>  1  he  received  a  wound  to  the  chin.</span><span>  The  issue  was  put  bevond  doubt  when</span><span>  I  Beaudesert  scored  at  26  minutes.  South</span><span>  Coast  was  forced  to  save,  giving  them</span><span>  a  temporary  respite.  The  ball  woe  seat</span></p> <p><span>  to  Beaudesert,  and  a  passing  movement</span><span>  put  Wellington  over  in  the  corner.</span><span>  Dauth  missed,  and  the  score  board  read</span><span>  Beaudesert  22,  South  Coast  10.</span><span>  Day  made  an  opening,  and  Sykes</span><span>  knocked  on  a  high  pass,  but  this  was</span><span>  the  first  of  a  series  of  last  opportuni</span><span>  ties  by  bad  handling  by  Beaudesert.</span><span>  A  try  in  the  last  minute  of  play</span><span>  gave  the  Beaudesert  15  grade  team</span><span>  its  first  win  in  the  Riley  Cup  com</span><span>  petition  this  season,  (he  final  score</span><span>  being  11-8.</span><span>  As  a  spectacle  the  game  left  a  lot</span><span>  to  be  desired,  never  producing  any</span><span>  thing  to  arouse  the  enthusiasm  of</span><span>  the  crowd.</span><span>  It  was  possibly  the  best  team  that</span><span>  Beaudesert  fielded  this  season,  but  the</span><span>  handling  and  defence  of  the  players</span><span>  generally,  was  disappointing.</span><span>  Beaudesert's  forwards,  led  by  Hay-</span><span>  lock,  won  the  honours  for  the  side,  with</span><span>  the  wingers  unfortunate  as  so  little</span><span>  ball  went  to  them,  due  to  the  weakness</span><span>  of  D.  Finglass  (five-eight),  and  the  bad</span><span>  handling  of  Peter  Callanan  (centre).</span><span>  H.  SeJlars,  full  back,  was  generally  in</span><span>  trouble.  In  the  first  half  Beaudesert</span><span>  won  17  scrums  to  nine  against  them,</span><span>  and  after  interval  it  was  11-10  against</span><span>  them.  The  best  use  was  not  made  of</span><span>  the  ball  by  any  means.</span><span>  The  extent  to  which  Beaudesert  in</span><span>  fringed  can  be  seen  by  the  fact  that</span><span>  in  the  first  half  the  side  was  penalised</span><span>  12  times  to  six  their  way.  and  after</span></p> <p><span>  half  tune  they  received  four  to  five</span><span>  against  them.</span><span>  The  teams  were:</span><span>  South  Coast:  Full  back,  W.

This  made  two  ten  liorse  events,  There</span><span>  were  not  as  many  starters  as  at  the  previous  meeting,  which  was  pro</span><span>  bably  a  record,  but  the  smallest  field  was  six,  and  tliht.was  in  the</span><span>  Fourth  Division,  of  seven  furlongs,  which  produced  it  Isct  of  horses</span><span>  so  well  prepared  that  punters  were  set  a  problem.-  '</span><span>  Throughout  the  afternoon  72  bookmakers  called  the  pads,  and  they</span><span>  saw  several  favourites  beaten,  while  some  fancied  horses-'  were  up  to</span><span>  what  their  supporters  claimed  them  to  he  when  they  ""  Harked  their  '</span><span>  beliefs  in  Â£,s.d.  y</span></p> <p><span>  The  light  rain  earlier  in  the  week</span><span>  had  served  a  good  purpose  in  that  it</span><span>  laid  the  dust,  there  being  no  worry  in</span><span>  this  regard  during  the  afternoon.  A</span><span>  short,  but  heavy,  shower  fell  just  be</span><span>  fore  the  horses  left  the  paddock  for</span><span>  the  first  event,  and  this  caused  the</span><span>  people  to  scatter  for  shelter.  This  was</span><span>  apparently  the  ""clearing""  up  shower</span><span>  because  there  was  no  rain  after  that.</span><span>  The  meeting  was  well  run  to  time,</span><span>  without  any  hitches.  The  connections</span><span>  of  three  horses,  Black  Amber,  Swan</span><span>  Joy  and  Fast  Ted,  were  each  fined  Â£1</span><span>  for  having  the  wrong  colours,  and  the</span><span>  owners  of  Bernicia  were  fined  Â£1  when</span><span>  they  were  allowed  to  amend  the  name</span><span>  of  the  owner,  to  include  a  second  name,</span><span>  that  of  a  joint  owner.</span><span>  The  first  division  of  the  Hack  was</span><span>  won  by  the  5  to  2  on  favourite,  Flash</span><span>  By,  who  had  been  given  the  lead  by</span><span>  St.  Athol  for  a  good  part  of  the  way.</span><span>  The  winner  finished  easily  with  three</span><span>  lengths  to  spare  from  Quarry,  who  was</span><span>  hard  ridden  by  Ashley  Burgess,  with</span><span>  St.  Athol  third.  David's  First  was  fifth</span><span>  to  Black  Amber.</span><span>  The  favourite  for  the  Second  Divi</span><span>  sion  of  the  Hack,  Mariville,  who  started</span><span>  at  6  to  4,  could  do  no  better  than</span><span>  fourth,  the  winner  being  the  second</span><span>  favourite  His  Nibs,  who  went  out  at</span><span>  5  to  2.

As  they  entered  the</span><span>  straight,  Mainfan,  wlio  had  been</span><span>  gradually  making  up  ground  on  the</span><span>  outside  of  the  field,  went  to  the  front,</span><span>  and  carried  on  to  win  by  two  lengths,</span><span>  with  a  length  between  Fast  Ted  and</span><span>  Boston.  There  was  a  big  gap  to  Red</span><span>  Mick,  who  was  just  ahead  of  Cabarita,</span><span>  with  Attu  last.</span><span>  The  6  to  4  on  favourite.  Bernicia.  led</span><span>  most  of  the  way  in  the  Fifth  Division,</span><span>  of  six  furlongs,  but  Country  Fox  hit</span><span>  the  front  in  the  straight,  and  won  by</span><span>  n  length  and  a  half.

When  they  swung  into  the  straight</span><span>  the  favourite  still  had  two  lengths  to</span><span>  spare.  It  was  a  good  race  over  the  final</span><span>  distance,  with  Country  Fox  finishing</span><span>  very  well.

"<p><span>  Beaudesert  Footballers  Win</span></p> <p><span>  Tiic  Beaudesert  and  '  District  Rugby  League  representative  Xc.ini</span><span>  won  the  first  match  of  the  1947  Gcraglity  Cup  competition  by  defeat</span><span>  ing  last  year's  cup  holders,  Wynnum,  by  24  to  9  alter  leading  11  to  nii</span><span>  at  half  time,  in  a  match  played  on  the  Beaudesert  show  grounds  on</span></p> <p><span>  Sunday.</span><span>  The  game,  for  the  greater  part  of  80  minutes,  was  played  at  a  hard</span><span>  and  fast  rate,  and,  although  the  scores  indicate  a  comfortable  win</span><span>  lor  the  home  side,  they  were  under  pressure  at  some  stages,  and  in  a</span><span>  few  minutes  Wynnum  crossed  the  line  twice  in  the  second  half,</span><span>  giving  Beaudesert  supporters  a  shock.</span><span>  The  Wynnum  team  won  the  Riley  Cup  competition  match  from</span><span>  Beaudesert  juniors  by  17  to  5.</span></p> <p><span>  The  high  standard  of  football  pro</span><span>  duced  at  Beaudesert  this  season  is  hav</span><span>  ing  its  effect.  The  contributions  of  the</span><span>  public  by  the  purchase  of  programmes</span><span>  on  Sunday  was  Â£73/8/6,  about  Â£20  less</span><span>  than  for  the  first  match  last  year,  but</span><span>  it  indicates  that  district  residents  arc</span><span>  football  minded.</span><span>  The  A  graders  had  a  decisive  win,</span><span>  and  while  there  was  no  doubting  that</span><span>  Beaudesert  has  a  good  team  in  the</span><span>  making,  it  was  obvious  that  condition</span><span>  was  lacking,  and  that  training  together</span><span>  will  be  necessary  to  fit  the  side  for</span><span>  the  hard  games  against  Southport,  and</span><span>  that  obstacle  of  obstacles,  the  return</span><span>  match  against  Wynnum  on  the  coastal</span><span>  ground.  Last  year  Beaudesert  won  at</span><span>  home  by  44  to  11,  bu;  the  boot  was  on</span><span>  the  other  foot  when  Beaudesert  went</span><span>  to  Wynnum.</span><span>  Only  intensive  training  will  fit  the</span><span>  team  lor  the  task  ahead  of  it,  and.</span><span>  with  the  first  leg  in,  Beaudesert  offi</span><span>  cials  should  go  for  it,  and  spend  money</span><span>  to  see  that  the  team  is  trained.</span><span>  Efforts  to  get  a  coach  for  last  week</span><span>  were  not  successful,  but  even  if  a</span><span>  highly  qualified  man  from  outside  the</span><span>  district  cannot  be  secured  it  is  up  to</span><span>  the  league  to  sec  that  the  team  gets</span><span>  together  at  least  two  nights.  Absence</span><span>  should  not  be  tolerated,  and  the  cosi</span><span>  of  bringing  D.  Anderson  from  Brisbane</span><span>  (provided  that  he  is  available  and  se</span><span>  lected)  will  have  to  be  faced.  It  is  no</span><span>  good  having  missing  links,  because  the</span><span>  team  must  train  as  a  unit  to  get  the</span><span>  finished  movements  that  should  be  de</span><span>  veloped.</span><span>  It  is  always  difficult  to  fault  a  win</span><span>  ning  team,  and,  on  their  form  on  Sun</span><span>  day,  the  forwards  should  have  no</span><span>  trouble  in  holding  their  positions.  They</span><span>  did  well  to  hold  such  hard  and  heavy</span><span>  men  as  Roff  and  Eckiand,  and,  al</span><span>  though  penalised  a  lot  in  the  scrums,</span><span>  they  were  on  top  in  this  regard.</span><span>  With  the  opposition  coming  around</span><span>  on  him  fast,  Day  was  rugged  enough</span><span>  to  take  the  gruelling  that  was  his  lot,</span><span>  but  he  wants  more  condition  in  the</span><span>  future.  He  was  a  very  tired  man,  and</span><span>  only  grit  kept  him  going  at  some  stages</span><span>  in  the.  second  half.  Plunkett  was  well</span><span>  served  with  the  ball,  and  he  made  the</span><span>  best  of  it.  and  his  inside  work  to  Blow</span><span>  started  off  numerous  passing  move</span><span>  ments.  Deane  was  in  everything.  Wel</span><span>  lington  had  his  day  on.  as  far  as  hand</span><span>  ling  was  concerned,  and  he  had  the</span><span>  honour  '  of  scoring  the  two  opening</span><span>  tries.  In  fact  it  was  these  that  no  doubt</span><span>  shattered  the  morale  of  Wynnum.</span><span>  Later  in  the  game  several  of  Welling</span><span>  ton's  ""takes""  were  bad,  but  he  will</span><span>  worry  other  teams  if  he  can  only  re</span><span>  tain  the  form  shown.</span><span>  The  other  winger,  O'Brien,  did  not</span><span>  get  the  chances  that  might  have  come</span><span>  his  way,  but  he  earned  his  place.  Taken</span><span>  all  through,  the  quarter  line  stood  up</span><span>  to  the  game  well  and,  with  a  chance</span><span>  to  perfect  some  of  the  ideas  that  exist,</span><span>  should  have  sufficient  tricks  up  its</span><span>  sleeve  to  score  points  in  future  games.</span><span>  L.  Yuke,  was  found  wanting  in  his  de</span><span>  fence  on  occasions,  two  of  which  were</span><span>  costly  to  the  side,  and,  although  his</span><span>  kicking  saved  his  side  on  numerous  oc</span><span>  casions.  he  has  been  seen  to  better</span><span>  advantage  previously.</span><span>  Wynnum  revealed  that  the  material</span><span>  was  there,  if  given  a  chance  to  work.</span><span>  Some  of  the  forwards  were  always</span><span>  looking  for  an  opening,  and  the  pivot</span><span>  men  were  fast  and  tricky,  and  a  greater</span><span>  supply  of  ball  would  have  shown  their</span><span>  worth.  In  Christensen  and  Sparks,  not</span><span>  to  mention  the  other  quartermen,</span><span>  Wynnum  had  plenty  of  speed.  Green</span><span>  was  not  the  custodian  that  played  such</span><span>  havoc  with  Beaudesert  at  Wynnum  last</span><span>  year.</span></p> <p><span>  The  teams  were:</span><span>  Beaudesert:  Full  back,  L.  Yuke;</span><span>  three-quarters,  G.  Wellington,  W.  Blow,</span><span>  P.  Deane,  E.  O'Brien;  five-eight,  T.</span><span>  Plunkett;  half  back,  W.  Day;  forwards,</span><span>  G.  Bontoft.  D.  Cahill,  C.  Crust,  J.</span><span>  Veivers,  V.  McGovern,  D.  Anderson.</span><span>  Wynnum:  Full  back,  F.  Green;</span><span>  three-quarters,  E.  Sparks,  H.  Ackworth,</span><span>  R.  Christensen,  K.  Quiiui;  five-eight,</span><span>  N.  Dalby;  half  back,  E.  Glass;  for</span><span>  wards,  C.  Roff,  P.  Carmody,  D.  John</span><span>  son,  L.  Eckiand,  K.  Bishop,  Van  Piper.</span><span>  Referee:  W.  Lewis.</span><span>  Beaudesert  was  continually  penal</span><span>  ised  for  breaches  in  the  scrums  and  the</span><span>  rucks,  and  this  is  a  matter  that  will</span><span>  have  to  be  given  consideration  before</span><span>  the  Southport  match  in  an  effort  to</span><span>  overcome  the  breaches.  Before  half</span></p> <p><span>  time  Wynnum  was  given  11  free  kicks</span><span>  to  six  to  Beaudesert.  and  the  margin</span><span>  after  the  interval  was  10-6  against</span><span>  Beaudesert.  Some  were  unavoidable,</span><span>  but  the  players  will  have  to  be  made</span><span>  to  realise  that  it  was  only  good  luck</span><span>  that  these  mistakes  did  not  have  points</span><span>  scored  off  them,  because  an  opposition</span><span>  goalkicker  has  only  to  be  on  his  day  to</span><span>  pile  up  the  penalty.</span><span>  Beaudesert  won  the  day,  as  far  as</span><span>  scrummages  were  concerned.  They  had</span><span>  the  advantage  in  15  of  the  28  scrums</span><span>  berore  interval,  and  by  17  to  12  after</span><span>  the  break.</span><span>  The  game  started  at  a  very  fast  rate,</span><span>  with  Beaudesert  going  forward  with  a</span><span>  rush.  Yuke  attempted  a  field  goal.</span><span>  At  four  minutes  Beaudesert  won  a</span><span>  scrum,  and  the  ball  passed  along  the</span><span>  line  for  Blow  to  send  Wellington  over</span><span>  well  out  wide.  Wellington  beat  the  op</span><span>  position,  and  touched  down  in  a  handy</span><span>  position.  McGovern  failed.  Four  min</span><span>  utes  later  Green  attempted  a  kick  at</span><span>  goal  for  Wynnum,  but  missed.  Green</span><span>  had  been  an  outstanding  points  scorer</span><span>  last  time  the  teams  met  at  Wynnum.</span><span>  Van  Piper,  who  went  on  the  field</span><span>  with  plaster  over  his  eye,  covering  an</span><span>  injury  of  a  week  earlier,  received  a</span><span>  bump,  and  the  wound  opened,  and  he</span><span>  retired.  Pascoe  took  his  place.</span><span>  Only  12  minutes  had  elapsed  when</span><span>  Wellington  secured,  and  raced  every</span><span>  thing  for  the  line,  to  score  at  the  up</span><span>  rights.  It  was  a  good  effort.  Blow  added</span><span>  the  extras,  and  Beaudesert  led  8-0.</span><span>  Receiving  a  ball  when  moving  fast,</span><span>  Yuke  ran  up  from  the  fullback  posl-</span><span>  tion,  to  beat  player  after  player.  He</span><span>  gave  to  Wellington.  The  movement</span><span>  swung  ahead  in  great  style,  but  Beau</span><span>  desert  was  penalised.  Later  Yuke  at</span><span>  tempted  a  kick  five  yard  from  the  side</span><span>  line,  and  ten  yards  from  half  way.</span><span>  Dalby  also  missed  a  long  kick,  and</span><span>  later  had  another  shot  that  missed.</span><span>  Beaudesert  started  a  nice  move.  Dalby</span><span>  intercepted,  but  solid  play  on  the  part</span><span>  of  Beaudesert  pulled  the  side  out  of</span><span>  trouble.</span><span>  Two  good  chances  were  lost  by  Beau</span><span>  desert  in  as  many  minutes.  Blow,</span><span>  Deane  and  Wellington  handled  .  in</span><span>  turn,  and  the  latter  kicked  ahead,  for</span><span>  Deane  to  take  it  again,  and  be  tackled</span><span>  close  to  the  line.  Beaudesert  was  pen</span><span>  alised,  and  the  ball  was  kicked  to  Yuke,</span><span>  who  went  through  on  his  own.  Beau</span><span>  desert  was  again  penalised,  and  the</span><span>  opposition  cleared.</span><span>  Up  to  this  stage  Beaudesert  had  been</span><span>  penalised  10  times  to  five  In  their  fav</span><span>  our.  infringements  being  in  the  scrums</span><span>  and  rucks.</span><span>  Beaudesert  won  a  scrum,  and  the</span><span>  ball  went  to  Plunkett.  and  he  drew  his</span><span>  man,  and  sent  to  Blow.  Blow  passed  to</span><span>  O'Brien,  who  went  for  the  corner.</span><span>  When  it  looked  as  If  fast  approaching</span></p> <p><span>  opposition  would  most,  likely  force</span><span>  O'Brien  out,  that  player  propped,  and</span><span>  then  pushed  his  way  the  lew  remaining</span><span>  yards  to  get  there.  McGovern  missed,</span><span>  and  the  score  at  36  miriutes  was  Beau</span><span>  desert  11  to  nil.</span><span>  From  the  kick  off  Crust  secured,  and</span><span>  raced  through  on  his  own.  He  went</span><span>  as  lar  as  he  could,  and.  when  in  a</span><span>  patch  ol  opponents,  looked  for  the  sup</span><span>  port  that  was  not  there.  A  lew  trail</span><span>  ers,  and  the  work  might  not  have  been</span><span>  in  vain.  Beaudesert  was  penalised  and</span><span>  lost  ground.</span><span>  Within  a  minute  of  die  kick  off,</span><span>  alter  half  time,  Day  made  a  dash  from</span><span>  a  scrum  at  the  quarter  way.  He  got  as</span><span>  far  as  the  opposition  full  back,  who</span><span>  was  on  his  own  line.  Day  went  us  if  he</span><span>  was  going  to  pass  the  ball,  but,  ap</span><span>  parently.  decided  to  go  on  his  own,</span><span>  and  he  got  there.  Blow  did  the  rest.</span><span>  Wynnum  took  the  ball  through  from</span><span>  the  kick  off,  and  when  tlicy  had  the</span><span>  man  over,  they  knocked  on.  At  ten</span><span>  minutes,  Wynnum  won  its  first  scrum</span><span>  of  the  session,  Beaudesert  having  won</span><span>  eight  in  a  row  to  this  stage,  Wynnum</span><span>  would  have  been  over,  but  lor  a  knock</span><span>  on.  Wellington  transferred  play  down</span><span>  the  line.</span><span>  Beaudesert  won  a  scrum  at  13  min</span><span>  utes,  and  Plunkett  gave  to  Blow,  who</span><span>  found  a  big  opening,  and  ran  to  the</span><span>  full  back.  The  pace  had  been  on,  and</span><span>  Blow  had  given  of  his  best.  He  drew</span><span>  his  man,  and  gave  to  Deane,  who  won</span><span>  the  race  to  the  line.  Wellington  was</span><span>  with  him,  and  the  pace  was  so  slow  by</span><span>  then  that  Wellington  was  reduced  to  a</span><span>  trot  when  they  crossed  over.  There</span><span>  was  no  opposition  at  the  end,  the  per-</span><span>  suers  giving  up  the  task.  Blow  missed</span><span>  an  easy  one.</span><span>  With  play  handy  to  Beaudesert's  line,</span><span>  Rolf  tried  to  make  his  way  through  by</span><span>  sheer  force,  but  the  deieuee  was  too</span><span>  strong.  He  had  been  well  handled  dur</span><span>  ing  the  progress  .of  the  match,  and</span><span>  rarely  did  he  get  a  chanre  to  got  mov</span><span>  ing.  Ackworth  was  seen  in  a  great  pick</span><span>  up  when  McGovern,  who  was  promin</span><span>  ent  in  several  individual  efforts,  went</span><span>  through  with  the  leather  at  his  toe.</span><span>  Eighteen  minutes  had  passed  when</span><span>  there  was  an  exchange  ol  long  kicks</span><span>  between  both  sides.  Quinn  received,</span><span>  and,  seeing  an  opening  on  the  other</span><span>  side  of  the  field  cross  kicked,  and</span><span>  Sparks,  who  was  at  his  top,  secured.  He</span><span>  ran  to  Yuke,  to  easily  beat  him,  and</span><span>  cut  inside,  to  go  under  the  uprights.</span><span>  Dalby  missed.</span><span>  Wynnum  sparked  up.  and  two  min</span><span>  utes  later  had  reduced  Beaudesert's</span><span>  lead  to  13  points.  Dalby  intercepted</span><span>  a  pass  in  Beaudesert's  territory,  and</span><span>  went  away  at  a  great  pace.  He  beat</span><span>  Yuke  to  the  line.  Glass  tailed  in  a</span><span>  comparatively  easy  one.</span><span>  Dalby  attempted  a  field  goal  at  32</span><span>  minutes,  and  Beaudesert  won  tire  re-</span></p> <p><span>  sultant  scrum.  Day  sent  out.  and</span><span>  Plunkett  and  Blow  handled,  the  latter</span><span>  cutting  through  an  opening  beside  the</span><span>  pack.  He  kicked  ahead  when  pressed,</span><span>  but  missed,  the  bounce.  Veivers  followed</span><span>  on,  and  picked  up,  and  was  able  to  dive</span><span>  over.  Crust  added  the  extras.</span><span>  Within  seven  minutes  of  full  time,</span><span>  Wynnum  was  given  a  free  kick  in  a</span><span>  handy  position,  and  elected  to  put  the</span><span>  ball  Into  the  air.  They  were  then  in  a</span><span>  ""handy  position.  Eckiand  went  over,  and</span><span>  only  had  -lo  touch  down,  but  there  wore</span><span>  several  Beaudesert  men  handy,  and</span><span>  they  won  the  pushing  competition  that</span><span>  sent  Eckiand  out  of  touch.</span><span>  There  was  a  great  tussle  on  the  line,</span><span>  in  which  Wynnum  did  some  good  work,</span><span>  but  two  mistakes,  including  an  offside</span><span>  effort,  lost  them  the  advantage.</span><span>  Play  swung  across-.  field,  with  Wyn</span><span>  num  slinging  the  ball  about  in  great</span></p> <p><span>  style.  Christensen  found  himself  in  the</span><span>  open,  and  when  he  came  to  Yuke,  he</span><span>  had  no  trouble  to  fend  that  player  off</span><span>  and  score.  Ackworth  '  failed.</span><span>  Quinn  was  hurt,  and  retired,  ,'ust  on</span><span>  the  final  whistle.</span><span>  Wynntun's  back  line  was  too  fast</span><span>  and  active  for  the  Beaudesert  ltiicy</span><span>  Cup  team,  and  it  won  by  17  to  5</span><span>  after  a  hard  game.</span><span>  Beaudesert  had  the  advantage  in</span><span>  the  scrums,  and-  their  forwards,  al</span><span>  though  lagging  at  times,  due  to  lack</span><span>  of  condition,  were  able  to  keep  the</span><span>  winning  margin  down.</span><span>  Before  half  time  Beaudesert  won  11</span><span>  scrums  to  'eight.  lost,  and  after  interval</span><span>  won  17  to  six  against  them.  In  all</span><span>  Beaudesert  was  awarded  ten  free  kicks,</span><span>  one  in  the  second  half,  and  Wynnum's</span><span>  figures  wore  four  and  eight  resncct-</span></p> <p><span>  ively.</span><span>  Beaudesert  was  called  on  to  defend</span><span>  in  the  first  few  minutes,  and  they  had</span><span>  several  close  shaves,  with  free  kicks</span><span>  giving  them  some  relief.  J.  Nichols,</span><span>  who  proved  to  be  a  worthy  goalkicker,</span><span>  raising  the  flags  four  times,  missed  a</span><span>  kick  14  minutes  after  play  started.</span><span>  Three  minutes  later  Beaudesert</span><span>  started  its  line  moving  in  its  own</span><span>  quarter,  but  a  knock  on  was  signalled.</span><span>  Unaware  of  this,  J.  Barrett  and  P.  Cal-</span><span>  lanan,  chased  by  several  Wynnum</span><span>  players,  turned  on  football  that  would</span><span>  have  brought-  down  the  ""house""  had</span><span>  it  not  been  wasted  energy.  A  few</span><span>  minutes  later  Faine  battled  his  way</span><span>  through,  although  there  was  ample</span><span>  room  for  him  to  work.  Nichols  did  the</span><span>  rest.</span></p> <p><span>  Beaudesert  was  being  given  a  lesson</span><span>  on  passing  and  backing  up,  with  the</span><span>  visiting  backs  dominating  play.  Faine</span><span>  was  always  dangerous,  cutting  through,</span><span>  and  using  his  weight  to  advantage.  At</span><span>  25  minutes  Nichols  took  a  long  kick</span><span>  that  hit  the  cross  bar.  and  shot  over.</span><span>  Nichols  miskickcd  lrom  a  free.  At  29</span><span>  minutes  Grisbrook  went  over,  for</span><span>  Nichols  to  convert,.</span><span>  Beaudesert  took  up  the  attack,  and</span><span>  went  close  to  making  their  objective.</span><span>  M.  Barrett  received  in  a  passing  rush,</span><span>  and,  instead  of  sending  out  to  his  sup</span><span>  ports  cut  in,  and  Haylock  was  able  to</span><span>  go  through  the  ruck,,  and  score  under</span><span>  the  posts.  The  scorer  added  the  extras,</span><span>  and  at  32  minutes  Wynnum  led  12-5.</span><span>  The  greater  part  of  the  first  half</span><span>  hail  been  played  in  Beaudesert's  ter</span><span>  ritory,  with  a  lot  of  it  in  their</span><span>  quarter.  Sellers,  at  fullback,  had</span><span>  not  been  able  to  use  his  boot  to  ad</span><span>  vantage,  giving  his  forwards  un</span><span>  necessary  work  and  knocking  up  his</span><span>  team  generally,  while  the  quarter</span><span>  lino  had  been  ineffective,  due  to</span><span>  inability  to  handle.</span><span>  Beaudesert  went  on  the  field  for  the</span><span>  second  half  refreshed,  and,  although</span><span>  they  won  the  leather,  they  were  unnble</span><span>  to  make  use  of  it.  When  they  had  a</span><span>  chance  of  scoring,  a  penalty  lost  them</span><span>  ground.  There  was  some  exciting  play</span><span>  as  the  game  swung  up  and  down  field,</span><span>  but  Wynnum  again  came  out  on  top.</span><span>  Nichols  kicked  a  goal  when  Beaudesert</span><span>  was  penalised  for  offside  play  In  front</span><span>  of  the  posts.</span><span>  L.  Johnson,  who  had  played  an  out</span><span>  standing  game  at  fullback,  came  up</span><span>  to  the  wing  position,  and  he  was  seen</span><span>  in  some  great  individual  work  that  left</span><span>  the  opposition  standing.

Schmidt's  bowling  for  Rcdland</span><span>  Bay  was  a  treat  to  watch.  He  is  the</span><span>  best  s:OW  bowler  seen  in  these  pares  for</span><span>  years.  Some  of  the  Beuuclesert  batsmen</span><span>  were  quite  helpless  against  him.  The</span><span>  innings  of  Arthur  Draheim,  for  Beau-</span><span>  desere,  will  long  be  remembered,  and  is</span><span>  one  of  the  best  ever  played  on  the</span><span>  Beaudesert  turf.  He  was  determined  to</span><span>  solve  the  problem  set  by  Schmidt,  and</span><span>  when  he  did,  he  qttached  in  dashing</span><span>  style,  and  won  the  game  lor  his  side</span><span>  Beaudesert's  fielding  was  a  great  im</span><span>  provement  on  their  showing  against</span><span>  Nerang,  and,  in  R.  Fordyce,  they  ap</span><span>  pear  to  have  a  first  clas.,  prospect  as</span><span>  a  fast  opening  bowler.</span><span>  A  collection  realised  Â£3-2,'-.</span><span>  After  winning  the  toss  Red.'and's</span><span>  captain,  A.  Buchbach,  decided  to  have</span><span>  first  use  of  a  first  class  wicket  pre</span><span>  pared  by  groundsman  I-erguson.  The</span><span>  opening  batsmen  were  not  comfortable</span><span>  when  lacing  fast  bowler  r.  Fordyce</span><span>  but  it  was  S.  Dunn  who  secured  the</span><span>  first  wicket  when  he  bowled  G.  Sham</span><span>  rock  with  the  third  ball  of  his  opening</span><span>  over  (one  wicket  for  three).</span><span>  The  second  wicket  fell  at  30  when  ,K</span><span>  White  took  a  good  catch  at  first  slip</span><span>  to  dismiss  A.  Benfer  off  E.  Arthy.  With</span><span>  the  score  at  41  A.  Giles,  who  had</span><span>  scored  22,  hit  a  ball  from  K.  Smith</span><span>  hard,  and  low  to  J.  Sandy  who  was</span><span>  fielding  near  the  square  leg  boundary,</span><span>  and  he  made  no  mistake.</span><span>  When  C.  Apps  was  bowled  by  K.</span><span>  Smith  with  the  score  ai  62,  and  F</span><span>  Kratzman  was  also  bowled  next  ball</span><span>  five  wickets  were  down  for  02.  and  Red-</span><span>  lands  were  in  a  bad  position.</span><span>  A.  Buchbach,  who  was  .shaping  well,</span><span>  was  brilliantly  caught  by  J.  Sandy  with</span></p> <p><span>  cne  score  at  92,  and  Fordyce  secured</span><span>  his  first  wicket,  which  was  richly</span><span>  deserved.  Seven  were  out  for  106,  when</span><span>  K.  Smith  held  a  neat  catch  in  front</span><span>  of  the  pavilion  to  dismiss  C.  Smith,</span><span>  who  had  played  a  good  knock  for  32</span><span>  m  33  minutes,  inluding  one  six.</span><span>  The  remaining  batsmen  did  not  last</span><span>  long,  and  the  side  was  out  for  121,</span><span>  made  in  127  minutes.  It  was  a  poor</span><span>  score  by  the  holders  or  ihe  Webb</span><span>  Shield,  and  Beaudesert  went  to  lunch</span><span>  feeling  very  confident,  as  the  wicket</span><span>  was  playing  very  well.</span><span>  K.  White  and  H.  Watkins  opened</span><span>  confidently,  and  it  was  unfortunate</span><span>  wncn  H.  Watkins  was  run  out  with  the</span><span>  score  at  37.  Watkms,  wnu  was  piaying</span><span>  his  first  district  game;  shaped  well  for</span><span>  his  17.  A  change  came  cner  the  game</span><span>  when  K.  White  was  dismissed  next  ball,</span><span>  stumped  C.  Smith,  bowled  C.  Schmidt</span><span>  for  18.</span><span>  A.  Draheim  opened  his  account  with  a</span><span>  single,  but  three  balls  later  E.  Arthy,</span><span>  who  had  not  scored,  fell  to  C.  Schmidt,</span><span>  and  with  three  wickets  down  for  38</span><span>  Beaudesert  was  in  a  tight  spot.</span><span>  J.  Sandy  was  out  for  onlj  5  when  he</span><span>  also  fell  to  o.  Schmidt.  J.  Teese  could</span><span>  not  stop  the  rot,  and  was  dismissed</span><span>  lor  4.

At  this  stage</span><span>  the  slow  bowler  had  taken  6  wickets  for</span><span>  37,  and  only  Draheim  appeared  to  be</span><span>  able  to  handle  him.  K.

However  your  rest  is  well  earned,</span><span>  and  so  we  will  join  most  heartily  in</span><span>  wishing  you  bon-voyage;  a  pleasant</span><span>  holiday;  and  a  safe  return.""</span><span>  The  testimonial,  is  one  of  Dr.  Beet's</span><span>  proudest  possessions,  as  is  also  a  photo</span><span>  graph  of  a  rifle  shooting  team,  of  which</span><span>  lie  was  a  member,  and  which  repre</span><span>  sented  Queensland  in  the  inter-state</span><span>  competitions.</span></p> <p><span>  Members  of  the  Beaudesert  Bowl</span><span>  ing  Club  accorded  Dr.  Beet  a  fare</span><span>  well,  following  their  annual  presenta</span><span>  tion  of  trophies.</span><span>  The  event  look  the  form  of  a  social</span><span>  so  that  members  and  their  wives,  and</span><span>  mcmucrs  of  tne  ladies  club,  could</span><span>  gather.</span><span>  It  was  quite  a  jolly  night,  and  musi</span><span>  cal  numot-rs  and  competitions  added  to</span><span>  the  enjoyment.</span><span>  The  guest  was  made  the  recipient  of</span><span>  a  lishing  lod  and  reel  comp  ete,  the</span><span>  presentation  being  made  by  ihe  senior</span><span>  vice  president  (Mr.  P.  C.  Ailpass).</span><span>  Dr.  Beet  was  e.ected  President  at  the</span><span>  last  annual  meeting  and  during  the</span><span>  nigh;,  lie  presented  trophies  won  by</span><span>  members  tnis  year.</span><span>  Mr.  Ailpass  said  that  they  had  come</span><span>  to  a  saci  part  of  the  proceedings,  as,</span><span>  officially,  iney  were  saying  good-uys  to</span><span>  a  good  member,  and  president.  Dr.  Beet</span><span>  had  laken  a  great  interest  in  sport  in</span><span>  Beaudesert.  Tnerc  was  no  more  popular</span><span>  member  on  the  green  than  Dr.  Bee.,</span><span>  who  had  pioved  himself  a  good  sport.</span><span>  Dr.  Beet  had  taken  part  in  practi</span><span>  cally  every  sport.  It  was  not  a  mat.er</span><span>  of  words,  but  the  club  would  miss  him</span><span>  from  the  green.  They  all  knew  how</span><span>  often  his  game  was  interrupted  by  the</span><span>  call  to  the  telephone  or  the  hospital,</span><span>  but  despite  this  he  was  one  of  the</span><span>  keenest  members.  They  had  come  to</span><span>  appreciate  Dr.  Beet  as  a  member  of</span><span>  tne  club  very  much  indeed.</span><span>  Mr.  E.  E.  Henley,  a  former  president</span><span>  said  that  as  a  oowier  Dr.  Beet  was  a</span><span>  young  man  at  the  game,  but  like  every</span><span>  other  sport  he  had  taken  on,  he  had</span><span>  made  himself  as  proficient  in  it  as  the</span><span>  others.  Dr.  Beet  nad  added  dignity  to</span><span>  the  office  of  president.  He  personally</span><span>  regie.  ted  that  he  was  going  away,  but</span><span>  he  was  glad  that  he  was  not  going  lar.</span><span>  Mr.  Henley  said  that  the  c  ub  was  m</span><span>  a  prosperous  condition.  It  was  Dr.  Beet</span><span>  and  others  of  his  calibre  who  were</span><span>  keeping  the  club  up  to  such  n  standard</span><span>  that  it  compared  lavourably  with  many</span><span>  others  in  Queensland.  The  bowhrs</span><span>  hoped  to  see  Dr.  Beet  very  often,  and</span><span>  he  was  quite  sure  that  any  spare  mo</span><span>  ments  Dr.  Beet  could  spend  from  lib</span><span>  fishing  would  be  spent  with  them  on</span><span>  the  green  at  week-ends.</span><span>  Mr.  Henley  referred  to  that  special</span><span>  quality  and  virtue  that  Dr.  Beet  had</span><span>  possessed  for  nearly  half  a  century,</span><span>  and  that  was  to  drop  his  racquet  or</span><span>  bowls,  and  go  to  a  sick  ca'l  immedi</span><span>  ately.  Such  things  added  prestige  to</span><span>  the  profession  to  which  Dr.  Beet  be</span><span>  longed.  It  was  a  blow  to  them  thai-  he</span><span>  was  going  away,  but  they  could  console</span><span>  themselves  that  they  would  have  a</span><span>  visit  from  him  on  occasions,  which  was</span><span>  n  big  thing.</span><span>  Mr.  Ahpass  presented  the  gift,  and</span><span>  said  that  the  club  hoped  that  it  was</span><span>  to  his  liking,  and  that  he  would  have</span><span>  a  great  deal  of  pleasure  when  using  it.</span><span>  Responding,  Dr.  Beet  said  that  Mr.</span><span>  Henley  was  right  in  saying  that  he</span><span>  would  come  as  often  as  he  could.  He</span><span>  would  be  lost  if  he  could  not  return  to</span><span>  Beaudesert,  and  he  would  always  be</span><span>  glad  to  get  back  to  his  own  home</span><span>  green.</span><span>  After  saying  that  he  was  as  sorry  as</span><span>  any  that  he  was  leaving  Beaudesert,  Dr.</span><span>  Beet  explained  that  he  was  retiring</span><span>  because  he  was  getting  on  in  years</span><span>  but  he  added  that  after  he  had  a  short</span><span>  holiday  he  thought  that  he  would  stick</span><span>  to  his  profession.  He  said  that  he</span><span>  hoped  that  he  wou'd  then  be  able  '.o</span><span>  take  a  short  holiday  when  he  felt  like</span><span>  it.</span><span>  Dr.  Beet  returned  thanks  for  the</span><span>  kindness  shown  him,  nnd  hoped  that,</span><span>  he  would  be  associated  with  the  club</span><span>  for  a  long  time  to  come.</span><span>  The  gathering  sang  ""For  He's  a  Jolly</span><span>  Good  Fellow,""  and  Included  Mrs.  Bent</span><span>  in  its  cheers.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIEND,  ADVISER  AND  DOCTOR  AS  HE  IS  TO-DAY  AT</span><span>  THE  AGE/.

Henley  (Chairman)  said</span><span>  that  Dr.  Beet  had  always  treated  the</span><span>  aboriginal  residents  of  the  district  with</span><span>  the  greatest  consideration,  and  in  turn</span><span>  this  was  appreciated  by  those  people.</span><span>  He  wondered  if  a  group  of  them  would</span><span>  care  to  lake  part  in  the  public  demon</span><span>  stration.  ;</span><span>  After  the  matter  had  been  discussed,</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  undertook  to  organise  this</span><span>  portion  of  the  ac.ivities.</span><span>  Mr.  Doyle  said  he  understood  that</span><span>  the  ladies'  committee  had  held  a  meet</span><span>  ing,  and  quite  a  few  members  were  not</span><span>  in  favour  of  selling  soft  drinks  dur</span><span>  ing  the  afternoon.  They  did  not  seem</span><span>  to  want  anything  like  that  at  the  show</span><span>  grounds,  but  others  were  in  favour  of</span><span>  catering  in  this  regard.</span><span>  Speakers  said  that  the  public  should</span><span>  be  considered,  especially  the  children,</span><span>  and  it  was  essential  to  have  soft  drink</span><span>  available.</span><span>  Mr.  Doyle  said  the  Beaudesert</span><span>  Branch  of  the  Red  Cross  Society  would</span><span>  definitely  handle  the  soft  drinks.  Hot</span><span>  water  should  also  be  available  for</span><span>  country  people  desiring  picnic  teas.</span><span>  All  agreed  that  they  should  accept</span><span>  the  offer  of  the  Red  Cross  Society.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  he  would  con</span><span>  fer  with  the  Beaudesert  Shire  Council</span><span>  officers  regarding  other  arrangements</span><span>  for  the  afternoon.</span><span>  Mr.  Doyle  said  it  seemed  quite  evi</span><span>  dent  that  the  people  of  the  district</span><span>  wanted  a  procession  to  pass  through</span><span>  the  streets  to  the  show  grounds.  He</span><span>  suggested  that  this  be  led  by  the</span><span>  band.</span><span>  Mr.  H.  S.  Smith  said  that  there</span><span>  would  be  a  lot  of.  traffic  to  the  show</span><span>  grounds,  but  this  could  be  switched</span><span>  from  William  Street.</span><span>  It  was  decided  to  hold  the  proces</span><span>  sion.  This  would  assemble  near  the</span><span>  former  C.W.A.  Rest  Room  site  at  1.30</span><span>  o'clock,  and  move  off  at  2  o'clock.</span><span>  Schoolchildren  would  lead,  followed  by</span><span>  the  Beaudesert  Town  Band,  which</span><span>  would  be  followed  by  the  units  of  the</span><span>  official  pageant.  Then  would  come  the</span><span>  floats,  and  members  of  the  organisa</span><span>  tions  responsible  for  them,  and  the</span><span>  cars  representing  the  various  districts.</span><span>  The  procession  is  timed  to  arrive  at</span><span>  the  show  grounds  at  2.15  o'clock.  Child</span><span>  ren  will  move  to  the  Ambulance  side</span><span>  of  the  grounds,  and  the  motor  vehicles</span><span>  to  the  gate  used  by  the  horses  enter</span><span>  ing  the  ring  during  the  show.  It  is  ex</span><span>  pected  that  children  from  each  school</span><span>  will  be  indicated  by  a""  banner  bearing</span><span>  its  name.</span><span>  Members  of  the  Beaudesert  National</span><span>  Fitness  Movement  will  provide  displays</span><span>  that  will  occupy  45  minutes,  and  the</span><span>  presentation  ceremony  Is  timed  to</span><span>  commence  at  3.30  o'clock.</span><span>  The  official  platform  is  to  be  occu</span><span>  pied  by  the  Chairman  of  llie  Beau</span><span>  desert  Shire  Council  (Clr.

"<p><span>  Three  Thousand  Farewell  Dr.  W.  A.  Beet</span></p> <p><span>  Impressive  Public  Function</span></p> <p><span>  TRIBUTE  TO  BEAUDESERT'S  BEST  LOVED  CITIZEN</span></p> <p><span>  -  THE  LIFETIME  ambition  of  any  person,  no  matter  what  his  standing  might</span><span>  1  be,  should  be  achieved  when,  on  his  departure  from  the  district  in</span><span>  which  he  had  made  his  home  for  a  long  t  .me,  a  big  percentage  of  residents</span><span>  gather  to  farewell  him.</span></p> <p><span>  So  when  3,000  voices  were  raised  at  tfie  Beaudesert  showgrounds  on</span><span>  Saturday  to  sing  ""Auld  Lang  Syne""  as  a  final  gesture  in  an  impressive</span><span>  farewell  to  Dr.  W.  A.  Beet,  Dr.  Beet  shouid  have  jolt  that  his  service  to  the</span><span>  community  had  not  been  in  vain,  and  that  the  good  and  unselfish  duty</span><span>  that  he  had  given  would  be  spoken  of  for  generations  ,  to  come.</span><span>  The  function  was  unique,  all  the  more  so  because  all  the  good</span><span>  things  said  about  the  ""Dr.""  were  true  in  every  way,  and,  to  a  man,  woman</span><span>  and  child,  the  crowd  was  unanimous  that  it  was  one  of  the  most  unhappy</span><span>  days  in  the  history  of  Beandesert,  and  one  that  could  not  be  forgotten</span><span>  although  all  felt  that  Dr.  Beet,  at  69,  was  overdue  for  a  well  earned  rest'</span><span>  which  will  be  spent  at  Southport.</span><span>  Few  centres  have  seen  such  a  percentage  of  residents  leave  their</span><span>  homes,  or  down  tools  on  farm  and  dairy,  and  travel  miles  to  farewell  two</span><span>  people,  and  have  no  other  attraction  but  a  bond  of  fellowship  to  draw  them</span><span>  as  they  saw  at  Beaudesert  on  Saturday.  Dr.  Beet  was  more  than  a  medico</span><span>  to  many.  He  was  a  friend  and  adviser,  and  the  fact  that  his  services</span><span>  could  not  be  repaid  in  money  immediately,  or  possibly  in  the  future,  never</span><span>  worried  him.  Those  who  could  pay,  paid,  but  generally  after  many  re</span><span>  quests  for  an  account,  which,  when  received,  did  not  include  an  amouut</span><span>  for  those  who  could  not  pay.</span><span>  This  was  how  Dr.  Beet  conducted  his  ""business,""  and  so  he  went  out  of</span><span>  Beaudesert  after  a  life  time  of  unselfishness,  hard  work,  and  long  hours,</span><span>  wealthy  as  it  is  possible  for  any  man  to  be,  not,  in  this  World's  goods,  but</span><span>  in  the  love  of  a  people  who  had  had  his  help,  services  and  advice,  in  times</span><span>  of  fair  and  bad,  and  in  sickness  and  in  health.</span><span>  In  health,  the  people  had  his  help  ;  beoause  he  was  a  keen  sport  for  the  pleasure  he</span><span>  got  out  of  the  game,  and  for  the  assistance  that  he  was  able  to  give  the  oontrolling</span><span>  body.  As  a  rifle  shot  and  tennis  player  he  was  hard  to'  beat,  and  he  was  not  out  of  place</span><span>  on  the  cricket  field,  and  then,  in  later  years,  he  enjoyed  a  game  of  golf,  and  latterly</span><span>  bowls;  As  a  chessplayer  Dr.  Beet  had  few  masters,  despite  the  annoyance  he  created  by</span><span>  making  winning  decisions  at  very  short  notlco  after  his  opponent  had  pondered  long</span><span>  before  making  a  move.  __</span><span>  With  all  these  things  in  mind  the  poople  oame  from  near  and  far  on  Saturday  to  show</span><span>  some  little  appreciation  for  Beet,  the  dootor,  Beet  the  humanitarian,  Beet  the  sport,  and</span><span>  Beet  the  good  townsman.  Hearing  the  remarks  of  oountless  bystanders,  new  arrivals  in</span><span>  the  district  were  not  surprised  at  the  crowd  that  saw  the  procession  move  through  the</span><span>  streets,  and  then  gather  at  the  showgrounds.</span></p> <p><span>  Children  from  district  schools,</span><span>  followed  by  the  Town  Band,  and</span><span>  then  the  Oddfellows,  and  the  other</span><span>  sections,  marched  through  lilies  of</span><span>  people  and  ears.  It  was  an  impres</span><span>  sive  sight  and  it  was  viewed  by  Dr.</span></p> <p><span>  and  Mrs.  Beet,  and  friends,  frqm</span><span>  the  balcony  of  the  Grand  Hotel.</span><span>  On  arrival  at  the  showgrounds</span><span>  the  procession  broke  off,  and  the</span><span>  Sublic  saw  a  display  of  youth  and</span><span>  tness  given  by  members  of  the</span><span>  Beandesert  National  Fitness  Move</span><span>  ment,  It  was  a  grand  thing  to  see</span><span>  so  many  young  people  from  school</span><span>  age  up,  showing  the  benefit  of</span><span>  training  in  good  clean,  healthful,</span><span>  muscle  building  exercises.  The  im-</span><span>  Sression,  that  the  movement  was</span><span>  oing  its  part  in  providing  the</span><span>  healthy  body,  and  helping  with</span><span>  ivh..t  ""should  be  associated  with  it,</span><span>  could  not  help  but  form  in  the</span><span>  minds  of  the  spectators.</span><span>  The  Town  Band  contributed  a</span><span>  programme  of  music.  The  presen</span><span>  tation  took  place  on  a  motor</span><span>  truck,  enclosed  in  greenery,  that</span><span>  was  drawn  up  in  the  centre,  of  the</span><span>  ring.  School  children,  and  others,</span><span>  fronted  the  impromptu  dais,  and</span><span>  behind  that  the  floats  and  pageant</span><span>  lined  up.  The  short  speech  list  was</span><span>  amplified  through  a  public  address'</span><span>  system.</span><span>  Dr.  Beer-  saw  himself  as  others  who,</span><span>  had  seen  him  as  an  energetic  young</span><span>  fellow,  thought  that  he  looked  in  those</span><span>  days.</span><span>  Firstly  the  ""Doc."",  complete  with  his</span><span>  moustache  and  white  coat,  was  seen</span><span>  striding  it  out,  swinging  his  surgical</span><span>  bag,  and  dangling  his  stethoscope.  Next</span></p> <p><span>  tire  self  same  whitecoated  figure  was</span><span>  seen  on  a  spirited  ""grey,""  and  later</span><span>  sitting  with  the  reins  of  a  horse  and</span><span>  trap  in  his  hands.  Then  came  several</span><span>  motor  cars,  and  the  tramway  tricycle</span><span>  that  used  to  be  propelled  on  the  Beau</span><span>  desert  tramway.</span><span>  Finally  Dr.  Beet's  car  of  today  was</span><span>  seen,  and  three  nurses  had  the  honour</span><span>  of  riding  In  this.</span><span>  Those  who  took  part  were:  Walking</span><span>  doctor  (Mr.  M.

Each  section  was  in</span><span>  charge  of  a  teacher,  or  district  resident.</span><span>  The  Oddfellows  Lodge  was  a  strong</span><span>  organisation,  the  members,  wearing  re</span><span>  galia,  marching.  They  were  followed  by</span><span>  a  float  from  the  Woodhill  Lodge,  with</span><span>  some  of  the  members  dressed  to  re</span><span>  present  the  emblems  of  the  order.</span><span>  Those  taking  part  were:  Misses  ""Jo""</span><span>  Morris,  Thora  Rodwell,  Noela  Freeman,</span><span>  Coral  Kittle  and  Elma  Manderson.</span><span>  The  Convent  School  was  represented</span><span>  by  a  float  in  which  the  prostrate  pati</span><span>  ent  (Julanne  Drynan)  was  being  at</span><span>  tended  by  the  doctor  (Brian  Kassulke),</span><span>  and  nurse  (Marie  Kassulke)  with  Rose</span><span>  mary  Coote,  a  visitor,  sitting  beside  the</span><span>  bed.</span><span>  The  colours  of  the  Beaudesert  Bowl</span><span>  ing  Club  â  blue  and  gold  â  were  prom</span><span>  inent  in  the  decorations  of  the  float</span><span>  arranged  by  the  members  of  the  Ladies'</span><span>  Club,  who  wished  Dr.  Beet  ""God  speed.""</span><span>  Members  of  the  club,  in  full  white,  oc</span><span>  cupied  seats  on  the  truck.</span><span>  The  Red  Cross  Society  float  was  most</span><span>  comprehensive,  showing  many  angles  of</span><span>  the  work  of  the  society.

He  thought  that  most</span><span>  people  would  have  noticed  the  wording</span><span>  of  tne  testimonial.  It  was  37  years  since</span><span>  that  testimonial  had  been  presented,</span><span>  and  those  words  truly  applied  to  Dr.</span><span>  Beet.  Dr.  Beet  was  all  they  said  he  was</span><span>  then,  and  he  was  all  that  they  said  he</span><span>  was  now.</span><span>  Clr.

E.  E.  Henley  (Chairman  of  the</span><span>  Beaudesert  Shire  Council)  in  addressing  the  meeting.</span><span>  After  referring  to  the  grand  part  England  played-  in  World  War  2,</span><span>  and  the  way  her  people  had  toiled  and  suffered  during  the  blackest</span><span>  period  that  England  had  ever  experienced,  Clr.  Henley  declared  that</span><span>  Australians  would  not  have  been  where  they  were  today  only  for  that</span><span>  noble  sacrifice.</span><span>  Tiic  machinery  was  put  in  operation  to  raise,  funds,  and  it  was</span><span>  decided  that  all  proceeds  would  be  considered  to  be  .part  of  the  big</span><span>  drive  being  made  by  the  Red  Cross  Society,  and  that  money  collected</span><span>  would  be  paid  into  the  Queensland  fund  through  the  Beaudesert</span><span>  branch.</span><span>  The  fact  that  the  need  was  one  of  urgency,  and  that  the  response</span><span>  had  to  be  spontaneous,  and  not  dragged  out  over  a  ""long  period  if  it</span><span>  were  to  be  successful,  was  stressed  by  speakers.</span></p> <p><span>  The  meeting  was  held  at  the  Techni</span><span>  cal  Hall  on  Tuesday  night,  as  a-  result</span><span>  of  an  advertisement  authorised  by  Clr.</span><span>  Henley.</span><span>  Opening  proceedings,  Clr.  Henley</span><span>  said  that  lie  was  not  quite  sure  of  whe</span><span>  ther  it  was  the  business  of  the  council</span><span>  to  do  that  sort  of  thing,  but  evidently</span><span>  the  Beaudesert  Branch  of  the  Red</span><span>  Cross  Society  was  not  functioning.</span><span>  Usually  that  activity  was  left  to  the</span><span>  Red  Cross  Society.  Mrs.  P.  Doyle  had</span><span>  telephoned  him,  and  asked  him  what</span><span>  to  do  in  the  matter.  As  a  result,  he  had</span><span>  called  the  meeting.  He  thanked  those</span><span>  present  for  attending.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  Mr.  J.  J.  Red</span><span>  mond,  of  Kooralbyn,  had  something  in</span><span>  view  as  a  means  of  helping  them.  Mr.</span><span>  Redmond  would  give  three  fat  bul</span><span>  locks,  which  was  a  very  good  dona</span><span>  tion.  Mr.  Redmond  would  organise  the</span><span>  graziers  with  .the  objective  of  getting  a</span><span>  truckload  of  bullocks.</span><span>  Voice:  .That  is  wonderful.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  if  the  graziers</span><span>  followed  this  example,  which  he</span><span>  thought  they  would,  the  district  might</span><span>  be  able  to  do  something  in  a  big  way</span><span>  which  would  be  a  credit  to  them.  He</span><span>  thought  that  Britain  needed  clothing,</span><span>  and  food,  and  the  district  would  need</span><span>  to  move  quickly,  as  the  position  was</span><span>  desperate.</span><span>  .  .-  /'Whatever  we  do.  to  help'  thdse  un  ""</span><span>  fortunate  people  must  be  done  quickly""</span><span>  said  Clr.  Henley,  who  thought  the  elec</span><span>  tion  of  a  ladies'  committee  was  an  ex</span><span>  cellent  thing.  The  number  who  had</span><span>  attended  that  night  showed  how  inter</span><span>  ested  they  were,  and  he  knew  that</span><span>  they  were  always  sympathetic  in  such</span><span>  cases.  He  thought  all  would  agree  that</span><span>  then1  sympathy  and  help  was  needed</span><span>  by  the  British  people  today,  and  he</span><span>  asked  for  suggestions  as  to  what  form</span><span>  the  help  should  take.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  his  idea  was  to</span><span>  have  a  ladies'  committee  in  Beaudes</span><span>  ert,  and  to  organise  similar  commit</span><span>  tees  In  all  parts  of  the  district.  As  far</span><span>  as  the  men  were  concerned,  a  small</span><span>  committee  could  be  formed  in  Beaudes</span><span>  ert,  and  outside  residents,  like  Mr.</span><span>  Redmond,  would  do  all  he  could  to</span><span>  organise  the  graziers.  They  would  pro</span><span>  bably  get  some  dairymen  to  organise  in</span><span>  their  department.</span><span>  Mr.  W.  Karoll  said  that  if  a  com</span><span>  mittee  was  formed  to  run  a  dance,  Mrs.</span><span>  Stuart  had  asked  him  to  announce  that</span><span>  her  orchestra  would  play  free  of  charge.</span><span>  He  thought  money  was  needed  as  well</span><span>  as  clothing.</span><span>  When  Clr.  Henley  asked  the  position</span><span>  of  the  hall  for  Friday  night  bookings,</span><span>  Mr.  Karoll  said  that  they  could  have  a</span><span>  mid-week  dance.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  he  was  sure  that</span><span>  many  ladies,  who  were  unable  to  at</span><span>  tend  that  night,  would  help.</span><span>  Mrs.  P.  Doyle  reminded  the  meeting</span><span>  that  the  men  could  help,  because  too</span><span>  much  was  generally  left  to  the  ladies.</span><span>  Father  Steele  suggested  the  meeting</span><span>  should  decide  under  whose  aeeis  they</span></p> <p><span>  should  conduct  their  drive.</span><span>  Mrs.  C.  Fisher,  a  vice  president  of</span><span>  the  Beaudesert  Red  Cross  Society,  said</span><span>  the  branch  was  still  functioning,  al</span><span>  though  they  did  not  have  a  president</span><span>  or  secretary.  At  the  last  annual  meet</span><span>  ing  they  were  asked  to  continue  as  a</span><span>  committee  to  function  in  cases  like  that</span><span>  before  the  meeting  that  night.  If  the</span><span>  drive  was  run  through  the  Red  Cross</span><span>  Society  functions  would  be  tax  free.</span></p> <p><span>  Clr.  Henley  asked  if  Mrs.  Fisher</span><span>  could  call  her  members  together,  and</span><span>  the  money  raised  could  pass  through</span><span>  the  Red  Cross.</span><span>  Mrs.  Fisher  said  that  she  had  told</span><span>  Headquarters,  Brisbane,  that  the  Wo</span><span>  men's  Auxiliary  was  a  very  active  body,</span><span>  and  asked  If  all  the  women  could  get</span><span>  together,  and  make  a  combined  effort,</span><span>  and  she  had  been  told  that  they  could</span><span>  do  so.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley:  I  am  keen  to  get  mov</span><span>  ing.  no'toatter  who  we  work  for.</span><span>  Father  Steele  said  the  advantages  of</span><span>  working  through  the  Red  Cross  So</span><span>  ciety  were  that  the  Society  had  already</span><span>  lodged  an  order  for  supplies,  and  had</span><span>  underwritten  the  appeal  to  the  extent</span><span>  of  Â£5,000,000.  Queensland's  share  of  the</span><span>  appeal  was  Â£70,000.  This  meant  that</span><span>  the  Red  Cross  did  not  have  to  wait  un</span><span>  til  the  money  was  collected  before  it</span><span>  started  organising  relief  measures.</span><span>  On  the  motion  of  Father  Steele  and</span><span>  Mr.  M.  T.  Sullivan,  it  was  decided  to</span><span>  work  through  the  Red  Cross  Society.</span><span>  Father  Steele:  We  will  raise  the</span><span>  money,  and  send  the  Red  Cross  the</span><span>  cash.</span><span>  To  Clr.  Henley,  Father  Steele  said</span><span>  that  he  thought  they  should  raise</span><span>  money.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  Mr.  Redmond</span><span>  was  under  the  impression  that  they</span><span>  could  send  a  truck  Idad  of  bullocks</span><span>  away,  and  this  would  find  Its  way  to</span><span>  the  Red  Cross  movement.</span><span>  Mr.  W.  Karoll  was  appointed  secre</span><span>  tary,  and  Mr.  A.  P.  Watson  treasurer.</span><span>  Mr.  Karoll  said  that  it  would  not  be</span><span>  a  long  drawn  out  appeal,  as  assistance</span><span>  had  to  be  spontaneous.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  was  elected  chairman.</span><span>  It  was  finally  decided  that  all  women</span><span>  present  be  Included  In  the  committee,</span><span>  with  Father  Steele,  Revs.  H.  W.</span></p> <p><span>  Griffiths,  J.  J.  ""JVilson,  Messrs.  A.  L.</span><span>  Lane  and  G.  Tranter.</span><span>  Mr.  F.  Hodgson  'stated  that  the  Beau</span><span>  desert  ""Times""  would  contribute  the</span><span>  necessary  advertising  free  of  charge,</span><span>  and  make  an  appeal  to  the  people  to</span><span>  give  what  they  could.</span><span>  Father  Steele  wondered  if  some  of</span><span>  the  lads  who  had  .-been  stationed  in  the</span><span>  R.A.A.F.  In  England  would  like  to  join</span><span>  hi  the  committee.  Ho  said  that  they</span><span>  had  good  cause  to'  remember  the  Eng</span><span>  lish  people.</span><span>  When  people  not  present  were  sug</span><span>  gested  for  the  committee,  Mrs.  Lane</span><span>  said  that  those  -who  had  shown  that</span><span>  they  were  interested  in  the  movement</span><span>  by  attending  that  -night  should  be  ap</span><span>  pointed  to  the  committee.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  he  would  like</span><span>  to  see  all  ladies  on  the  committee,  as</span><span>  they  had  shown  their  interest.</span><span>  Mr.  Karoll  said.,  he  thought  it  woulcj</span><span>  be  better  if  they  confined  their  action</span><span>  Â£o  raising  cash  and  collecting  clothing.</span><span>  Rev.  Wilson,  who  had  arrived  late,</span><span>  asked  if  it  would  be  an  advantage  to</span><span>  send  their  money  through  the  Lord</span><span>  Mayor's  Appeal  fund,  as  he  understood</span><span>  that  they  would  save  exchange  that</span><span>  way.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  pointed  out  that  the</span><span>  meeting  had  alretdy  decided  its  policy.</span><span>  Mr.  J.  V.  Shay  said.that  the  straight</span><span>  .oudonatiqn  K'gSsa/'golng.-  to  be  the</span><span>  big  thing/  Thei'cWis'  talk,  of/running</span><span>  functions,  but  the  ladies  had  to  work</span><span>  hard  to  raise  a  few  pounds.</span><span>  Mr.  Sullivan:  The  idea  is  to  send</span><span>  food  to  Britain,  and  not  money.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  it  was  clear  that</span><span>  money  would  not  be  sent  to  England.</span><span>  Australian  money  depreciated  25  per</span><span>  cent.,  and  even  then  the  people  of  Eng</span><span>  land  could  not  buy  anything  with  it.</span><span>  The  exchange  question  did  not  enter</span><span>  into  it.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Karoll  said  that  he  would  ask</span><span>  teachers  to  arrange  to  collect  clothing.</span><span>  Mrs.  P.  Doyle:  It  is  a  good  idea.  I</span><span>  have  been  offered  some  clothing.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  there  had  -been</span><span>  quite  a  number  of  offers  of  clothing,</span><span>  and  there  was  some  in  hand.  Some  re</span><span>  quired  mending.</span><span>  Mrs.  Fisher  said  worn  out  clothing</span><span>  was  not  wanted,  and  Mrs.  A.  Ball  said</span><span>  that  it  had  been  publicly  stated  by  a</span><span>  Red  Cross  official  that  it  would  be  an</span><span>  insult  to  send  second  hand  clothes  to</span><span>  England.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  they  could  inquire</span><span>  into  the  position.</span><span>  Mi'.  Karoll  said  that  the  women  could</span><span>  handle  the  clothing  angle.</span><span>  Mrs.  J.  N.  Gardiner  offered  to  act</span><span>  as  receiver,  and  convene  meetings  of</span><span>  ladies  to  handle  the  clothing.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  the  meeting  room</span><span>  at  the  hall  would  be  available  free  of</span><span>  charge  for  the  work  when  not  required</span><span>  otherwise.</span><span>  Rev.  Wilson  said  they  could  section-</span><span>  ise  the  town,  and  notify  the  people</span><span>  when  they  would  call  to  collect  cloth</span><span>  ing.  He  would  give  time  to  assist  on</span><span>  this.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  it  .was  a  good  idea,</span><span>  and  could  be  taken  up.</span><span>  Rev.  Griffiths  said  that  the  appeal</span><span>  for  clothing  was  not  half  as  import</span><span>  ant  as  the  appeal  for  funds,  as  food</span><span>  was  most  essential.  He  hoped  that</span><span>  whatever  they  did  was  done  in  the  next</span><span>  month,  and  not  allowed  to  drag  on.</span><span>  The  ""Sons  of  Matthew""  film  production</span><span>  company  might  put  on  a  concert.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  the  school  children</span><span>  could  canvass  for  clothing.  They  would</span><span>  contact  all  people.</span><span>  Rev.  Wilson  asked  If  this  method</span><span>  was  as  effective  as  adults  doing  the</span><span>  collecting.</span><span>  Mr.  Karoll  explained  the  good  results</span><span>  achieved  In  the  past.  ,</span><span>  On  the  motion  of  Messrs.  Shay  and</span><span>  Watson  it  was  decided  to  open  a  fund</span><span>  immediately.</span><span>  Father  Steele  said  that  the  younger</span><span>  group  had  booked  the  hall  for  April  22</span><span>  for  the  purpose  of  holding  a  dance  for</span><span>  the  fund.  If  that  was  a  good  date  the</span><span>  ladies  might  like  to  take  it  over.</span><span>  The  offer  was  accepted  with  thanks,</span><span>  also  that  of  Mrs.  Stuart  to  provide  the</span><span>  music.  Mesdames  Lane  and  Watson</span><span>  were  appointed  to  supervise  the  supper</span><span>  arrangements.</span><span>  Mr.  A.  Hood  is  to  be  asked  to  con</span><span>  tact  Mr.  Charles  Chauvel  to  ascertain</span><span>  if  the  company  could  help  in  the  en</span><span>  tertainment  line.</span><span>  Father  Steele  said  that  If  the  com</span><span>  mittee  was  going  to  run  any  function</span><span>  at  the  racecourse  he  thought  it  might</span><span>  appeal  to  the  committee  if  half  the</span><span>  proceeds  of  the  campdraft  arranged  by</span><span>  St.  Mary's  for  April  19  went  to  the</span><span>  fund.  They  hoped  the  campdraft  would</span><span>  be  popular.</span><span>  Mr.  Hodgson  said  it  was  a  remark-</span><span>  'i</span></p> <p><span>  able  offer,  and  most  generous.  St.</span><span>  Mary's  had  been  pushing  the  arrange-  .</span><span>  menus  for  the  draft,  and  on  the  eve</span><span>  of  the  function  they  made  a  generous</span><span>  offer  like  that.</span><span>  The  offer  was  received  with  thanks,</span><span>  and  the  motion  was  carried  by  ac</span><span>  clamation.  1</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  he  hoped  that</span><span>  the  meeting  would  give  the  organising</span><span>  committee  every  assistance,  and  that</span><span>  it  would  be  a  great  success.</span><span>  Mr.  Karoll:  With  all  these  functions</span><span>  we  should  be  able  to  do  something  by</span><span>  the  end  of  April.  People  should  be  able</span><span>  to  assist  .one  of  the  entertainments  in</span><span>  some  way.</span><span>  Mr.  Hodgson  suggested  making  an</span><span>  objective;  say  Â£1000  in  the  month.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  if  they  raised</span><span>  Â£1000,  it  was  not  necessary  to  stop  at</span><span>  that.</span><span>  Mr.  Karoll  said  that  they  should</span><span>  complete  the  drive  in  the  month  and</span><span>  that  the  people  should  give  freely  in</span><span>  that  time.  The  Beaudesert  show  would</span><span>  be  held  Immediately  after  and  there</span><span>  were  other  organisations  working.</span><span>  It  was  decided  that  the  committee</span><span>  meet  again  next  Wednesday  night.</span></p> ",Article,1947-04-03,Aid For Needy Britain Â£1000 WANTED IN APRIL Beaudesert Drive Starts,216077879,1,1,"{'score': '1142.3066', 'value': 'very relevant'}","A PUBLIC meeting at Beaudesert, which was attended by 30 people, launched an appeal to assist Britain in her hour of need, and it set out to raise Â£1000 during April, the necessity for prompt action being stressed by speakers.

The  respective  an</span><span>  nual  costs  are  Â£4,533  and  Â£4,301.  These</span><span>  costs  include  interest  and  redemption</span><span>  charges  based  on  a  30  year  loan  per</span><span>  iod,  and  interest  rates  at  3i  per  cent,</span><span>  and  subsidy  of  33  l/3rd  per  cent.</span><span>  Should  the  council,  after  considera</span><span>  tion  of  the  report,  decide  to  proceed</span><span>  further  with  either  of  the  schemes,  it</span><span>  will  be.  necessary  to  proceed  with  the</span><span>  preparation  of  working  plans,  specifi</span><span>  cations  and  estimates,  and  to  do  this</span><span>  the  council  may  apply  for  a  loan  and</span><span>  subsidy  to  cover  the  cost.  Approxi</span><span>  mately  Â£3  000  will  be  required  for  the</span><span>  purpose,  and  as  provision  has  already</span><span>  been  made  for  Â£1,500  by  treasury  loan</span><span>  and  subsidy,  a  further  Â£1,500  only  will</span><span>  be  required.</span><span>  Tlie  question  of  the  preparation  of</span><span>  working  plans,  specifications  and,  esti</span><span>  mates  was  discussed  witli  the  council</span><span>  lors  on  the  occasion  of  their  recent</span><span>  visit.  Tire  matter  has  been  carefully</span><span>  considered  and  it  is  desired  to  advise</span><span>  that  should  the  work  be  undertaken  by</span><span>  the  department  it  would  not,  in  view</span><span>  of  commitments  already  in  hand,  be</span><span>  able  to  furnish  the  plans  in  time  for  an</span><span>  application  for  a  construction  loan  to</span><span>  be  made  in  connection  with  the  1948/43</span><span>  loan  programme,  that  is  by  April  next,</span><span>  approximately.  However,  the  work</span><span>  .  could  be  undertaken  and  carried  out</span><span>  tor  the  following  year's  programme.""</span><span>  The  Water  Supply  Engineer  (Mr.</span><span>  Mortley)  furnished  the  following  re</span><span>  port:</span><span>  ""Herewith  Mr.  Engineer  Schmidt's</span><span>  preliminary  report  on  schemes  for  sup</span><span>  plying  the  town  of  Beaudesert  with</span><span>  water.</span><span>  Mr.  Schmidt  has  pointed  out  that</span><span>  neither  the  weir  site  on  the  Albert</span><span>  River  nor  that  on  the  Logan  River  is  a</span><span>  good  one  and  has  suggested  further  in</span><span>  vestigation  in  an  endeavour  to  find  a</span><span>  better  site.  This  should  be  done.</span><span>  .  A  scheme  from  either  river  would  be-</span><span>  satisfactory.  The  merit  of  the  Albert</span><span>  River  proposal  lies  in  the-  lower  mineral</span><span>  content  and  reduced  hardness.  By</span><span>  treatment  ,of  this  water  by  the  lime  ;</span><span>  .  soda  'process  the""  hardness  could  be  re--</span><span>  ducecf  to  a  low  figure.

Lower</span><span>  mineralization  may  be  expected  in  the</span><span>  stored  water.</span><span>  Costs  favour  the  Logan  River  scheme</span><span>  which  is  about  11  per  cent,  cheaper</span><span>  than  the  Albert  River  scheme.  The</span><span>  capital  cost  of  the  Albert  River  scheme</span><span>  is  estimated  at  Â£78,000  and  that  of  the</span><span>  Logan  River  scheme  at  Â£71.000.  The  an</span><span>  nual  expenditure,  exclusive  of  softening</span><span>  is:  Albert  River  Scheme  Â£4,533,  Logan</span><span>  River  scheme  Â£4,361,  and  the  costs  per</span><span>  tenement  are  respectively  Â£11/18/-  and</span><span>  Â£11/10/-.  Softening,  if  necessary,  would</span><span>  increase  these  costs.</span><span>  Recommendation:  Having  regard  to</span><span>  the  matters  i-aised  in  the  report  it  ap</span><span>  pears  that  there  is  little  to  choose  be</span><span>  tween  the  two  schemes.  The  crux  of  the</span><span>  matter  is  the  weir  and  it  is  recom</span><span>  mended  that  the  first  work  to  be  car</span><span>  ried  out  under  the  foundation  loan</span><span>  should  be  an  investigation  of  weir  sites</span><span>  on  both  rivers,  trial  designs  to  be  made,</span><span>  and  a  decision  to  be  then  reached  as  to</span><span>  which  scheme  should  be  adopted.""</span><span>  The  report  of  Mr.  V.

The  value</span><span>  of  these,  had  they  been  saved  and  pro-</span><span>  perly  fed,  would  have  reached  a  figure,</span><span>  hard  to  calculate,  which  would  have</span><span>  been  sufficient  to  provide  feed  and</span><span>  water  conservation  for  generations  to</span><span>  come.</span><span>  Your  article  contemplates  creating  a</span><span>  consciousness  of  the  drought  problem</span><span>  amongst  our  primary  producers  and</span><span>  leaders  of  public  thought.</span><span>  Mr.  A.  G.  Muller,  M.L.A.,in  his  ar-</span><span>  ticle  on  this  subject  in  your  paper,  sug-</span><span>  gests  a  water  conservation  league,  then</span><span>  goes  on  to  hand  all  responsibility  and</span><span>  blame  on  to  the  Government,  which</span><span>  is  only  a  clumsy  attempt  to  make  poli-</span><span>  tical  capital  out  of  the  farmers'</span><span>  troubles,  and  to  confuse  the  issue.</span><span>  The  problem  of  drought  cannot  be</span><span>  solved  by  irrigation  alone.  Fodder  can</span><span>  be  conserved  in  various  ways  in  the</span><span>  shape  of  silage,  hay  and  grain,  and</span><span>  on  most  dairy  farms,  this  must  be  one</span><span>  of  the  major  means  of  combating</span><span>  drought.  That  it  can  be  done  is  amply</span><span>  demonstrated  by  many  iarmers,  who</span><span>  are  successfully  doing  this.

"<p><span>  Shire  Council  and  Hospitality</span></p> <p><span>  Civic  Dinner  Discussed</span></p> <p><span>  Today  the  Beaudesert  ""Times""  takes  great  displeasure  in  telling  the</span><span>  people  of  the  discussion  that  took  place  at  the  last  meeting  of  the</span><span>  Beaudesert  Shire  Council  regarding  the  welcome  to  Mr.  and  Mrs.</span><span>  Charles  Chauvel,  and  members  of  the  ""Sons  of  Matthew""  production</span></p> <p><span>  company,  but  on  the  other  hand  it  records  with  pleasure  some  of  the</span><span>  remarks  of  the  speakers  at  what  was  a  most  successful  function.</span><span>  Normally,  the  report  of  the  council  discussion  would  have  appeared</span><span>  in  the  last  issue  of  the  Beaudesert  ""Times,""  but  this  journal  has  more</span><span>  public  spirit  than  some  councillors  appear  to  possess,  and  consequently</span><span>  refrained  from  making  their  views  public  prior  to  the  function,  and</span><span>  so  embarrassing  members  of  the  visiting  company,  and  causing  them</span><span>  to  feel  anything  but  welcome  at  a  party  given  in  their  honour.  It  is</span><span>  possible  that  the  visitors  might  not  have  attended  the  dinner,  had  they</span><span>  known  what  had  taken  place.</span><span>  The  ""Times""  is  happy  to  know  that  the  entertainment  was  well  done,</span><span>  and  in  keeping  with  the  highest  tradition  of  Queensland  hospitality.</span></p> <p><span>  While  the  altitude  of  some</span><span>  councillors  must  be  regarded  as</span><span>  having  provided  one  of  the  black-</span><span>  est  pages  in  the  history  of  the  dis-</span><span>  trict,  it  is  pleasing  to  know  that</span><span>  citizens  were  behind  the  action  of</span><span>  the  Chairman  of  the  Beaudesert</span><span>  Shire  Council  (Clr.  E.  E.  Henley)</span><span>  who  ""took  the  bull  by  the  horns,""</span><span>  to  use  his  own  words,  and  arranged</span><span>  the  welcome  dinner,  irrespective  of</span><span>  whether  the  council  dumped  him</span><span>  or  not.</span><span>  Rumours  were  rife  last  week  that</span><span>  the  dinner  was  not  taking  place,</span><span>  but  in  the  case  of  all  yarns  the</span><span>  originators  are  hard  to  locate.  The</span><span>  soul  of  those  responsible  for  such</span><span>  mouthings  must  indeed  be  black,</span><span>  and  their  minds  warped  and  nar-</span><span>  row.</span><span>  The  dinner  would  have  gone  on</span><span>  in  any  case,  Clr.  Henley  having</span><span>  beaten  his  opposition  to  the  punch,</span><span>  by  stating  from  the  outset  that  he</span><span>  would  pay  for  it  out  of  his  allow-</span><span>  ance,  if  necessary.</span><span>  The  ""Times""  here  makes  it  clear</span><span>  that  it  does  not  take  sides,  but  has</span><span>  no  hesitation  in  drawing  attention</span><span>  to  anomalies.  In  the  past  it  has</span><span>  not  pulled  its  punches  in  criticising</span><span>  Clr.  Henley,  and  exposing  what  it</span><span>  thought  was  a  wrong  action  on  his</span><span>  part.  On  this  occasion  It  commends</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  for  having  the  ""intes-</span><span>  tinal  fortitude""  to  make  a  decision,</span><span>  and  stick  to  it.</span><span>  There  is  one  thing  that  Is  to  be  re-</span><span>  gretted,  and  that  is  the  manner  in</span><span>  which  Clr.  Henley  had  to  appeal  to</span><span>  councillors  to  speak  their  minds  on  the</span><span>  subject,  when  he  threw  down  the</span><span>  gauntlet  at  the  meeting.  On  several  oc-</span><span>  casions  he  appealed  for  outspoken  dis-</span><span>  cussion.  (No  doubt  he  had  heard  state-</span><span>  ments  attributed  to  certain  people,</span><span>  whether  rightly  or  wrongly,  and  he,  like</span><span>  the  man  in  the  street,  wanted  them</span><span>  cleaned  up  at  the  right  place  â  the</span><span>  council  table).  Most  councillors  then</span><span>  said  what  was  apparently  in  their</span><span>  minds.</span><span>  The  whole  show  was  estimated  to</span><span>  cost  Â£30,  or  thereabouts.  One  does  not</span><span>  have  to  be  a  mathematician  to  work</span><span>  out  what  the  function  would  cost  each</span><span>  ratepayer,  or  each  acre  of  land,  to  put</span><span>  on  the  spread,  after  consulting  the</span><span>  souvenir  menu  which  proudly  tells  the</span><span>  world  that  the  shire  embraces  789</span><span>  square  miles  of  country  and  the  popu-</span><span>  lation  is  5,050.</span><span>  And  we  justifiably  tell  the  world  that</span><span>  we  have  one  of  the  richest  districts  in</span><span>  the  state  ;  that  we  have  big  hearted</span><span>  people  (and  there  is  no  doubt  about</span><span>  that)  ;  that  no  district  has  greater</span><span>  powers  of  recovery  after  times  of  ad-</span><span>  versity  ;  and  that  we  have  civic  pride.</span><span>  The  ""Times""  is  presenting  the  re-</span><span>  ports  in  sequence,  hoping  that  any  un-</span><span>  happy  feelings  readers  have  after  per-</span><span>  using  the  report  of  the  council  discus-</span><span>  sion  will  be  offset  by  the  spirit  that</span><span>  permeated  the  speeches  at  the  dinner.</span></p> <p><span>  A  report  of  the  council  discussion  is</span><span>  as  follows:</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  they  had  ar-</span><span>  ranged  for  a  civic  reception  to  the  film</span><span>  company  located  at  Round  Mountain,</span><span>  He  had  consulted  quite  a  number  of</span><span>  members  on  the  matter,  and  a  lot  of</span><span>  leaders  in  local  organisations  had</span><span>  spoken  to  him.  He  thought  the  oppor-</span><span>  tunity  too  good  to  miss.  It  was  quite  an</span><span>  honour  to  the  district  for  the  company</span><span>  to  be  located  in  their  midst,  and  it  was</span><span>  a  big  advertisement  for  not  only  the</span><span>  district,  but  for  Lamington  National</span><span>  Park.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  if  the  council</span><span>  did  not  wish  to  give  the  dinner  it  would</span><span>  be  done  outside  of  the  council.  It  was  a</span><span>  matter  of  what  the  council  thought.</span><span>  Clr.  P.  V.  Campbell  said  that  it  was</span><span>  the  first  time  a  civic  reception  had</span><span>  been  given  since  he  went  on  to  the</span><span>  council.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  he  had  noted</span><span>  that  the  New  Zealand  and  Victorian</span><span>  bowlers  had  been  given  civic  receptions</span><span>  by  the  council,  and  he  regarded  this</span><span>  as  much  more  Importance  to  the  dis-</span><span>  trict  than  12  bowlers  visiting  it.  It  was</span><span>  a  matter  for  the  council  to  decide.  If</span><span>  It  appealed  to  them,  well  and  good,</span><span>  and  if  not  the  dinner  would  go  on  just</span><span>  the  same.</span><span>  Clr.  J.  Aldridge:  I  am  in  favour  of  it.</span><span>  Clr.  Stephens  said  that  as  the  chair-</span><span>  man  of  the  council  had  arranged  the</span><span>  dinner  he  thought  the  council  would</span><span>  approve.  He  was  of  the  opinion  that  the</span><span>  dinner  part  was  not  altogether  neces-</span><span>  sary.  He  thought  there  would  be  re-</span><span>  percussions.  It  was  going  to  be  ex-</span><span>  pensive.</span><span>  Clr.  P.  V.  Campbell  said  that  this</span><span>  had  not  been  done  previously,  and  it</span><span>  looked  a  big  thing  to  go  into.  Whether</span><span>  they  would  gain  so  much  benefit  was</span><span>  problematical.  The  film  company  was</span><span>  more  or  less  a  business  concern.  He</span><span>  thought  it  was  going  a  little  further</span><span>  than  necessary  in  giving  a  dinner,  al-</span><span>  though  it  might  turn  out  to  be  a  good</span><span>  thing.  If  it  rained  on  Friday  night</span><span>  some  people  could  not  get  in  to  Beau-</span><span>  desert.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  appealed  to  councillors  to</span><span>  discuss  the  matter  freely.</span><span>  Clr.  P.  V.  Campbell  said  that  what</span><span>  he  had  meant  in  earlier  statements</span><span>  was  that  the  council  had  done  nothing</span><span>  previously  in  the  way  contemplated  by</span><span>  the  council.  He  thought  that  a  welcome</span><span>  only  had  been  given  in  the  past.</span><span>  Clr.  C.  F.  Henderson  said  that  a</span><span>  dinner  had  been  given  in  the  past,  but</span><span>  he  did  not  know  who  gave  it.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley:  I  have  looked  it  up  in</span><span>  the  council  records,  and  I  find  that  the</span><span>  council  paid  for  it.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  detailed  what  he  had</span><span>  done  in  making  the  arrangements,  and</span><span>  added  that  if  the  council  dd  not  agree</span><span>  with  what  he  had  done  he  would  pay</span><span>  for  the  dinner  himself.</span></p> <p><span>  Clr.  H.  Campbell  said  that  he  was</span><span>  quite  in  favour  of  the  proposal  when</span><span>  it  was  put  to  him.  He  did  not  know</span><span>  whether  he  had  read  the  paper  cor-</span><span>  rectly,  but  he  had  understood  that  the</span><span>  dance  to  be  held,  would  pay  for  the</span><span>  dinner.  He  was  quite  prepared  to  pay</span><span>  his  share,  as  it  was  a  great  thing  for</span><span>  the  district.  It  was  a  much  more  de-</span><span>  serving  case  than  that  done  with  the</span><span>  bowlers.</span><span>  Clr.  A.  Drynan  jnr.  recalled  that  he</span><span>  had  been  present  on  the  Saturday</span><span>  afternoon  when  the  matter  was  dis-</span><span>  cussed  while  a  party  was  awaiting  the</span><span>  arrival  of  the  film  unit.  He  thought  the</span><span>  welcome  would  be  made  at  a  dance,  as</span><span>  was  done  with  other  things.  He  did</span><span>  not  expect  that  the  reception  would  be</span><span>  a  dinner.  That  was  all  he  knew  about</span><span>  it  until  he  read  about  the  arrange-</span><span>  ments  in  the  paper.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  he  could  not</span><span>  leave  the  decision  until  the  council</span><span>  meeting,  as  there  was  so  much  pre-</span><span>  liminary  work  to  be  done.  It  was  a  case</span><span>  of  take  the  bull  by  the  horns.</span><span>  Clr.  Henderson  said  that  he  was  at</span><span>  the  dinner  given  the  N.Z.  bowlers.  It</span><span>  appeared  to  be  the  general  thing  if  any</span><span>  big  delegation  or  notables  paid  a  visit</span><span>  to  a  town  to  give  them  a  civic  recep-</span><span>  tion,</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  the  visitors</span><span>  were  given  civic  receptions  at  Tenter-</span><span>  field  and  Stanthorpe,  as  they  moved</span><span>  from  Sydney  to  Beaudesert,  and  those</span><span>  places  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  film.</span><span>  Clr.  Henderson  said  that  he  thought</span><span>  the  suggestion  was  a  good  thing  but  he</span><span>  did  not  know  how  the  public  would</span><span>  view  it  after  the  disastrous  season  ex-</span><span>  perienced.  He  thought  it  was  a  cour-</span><span>  tesy,  and  something  would  accrue  from</span><span>  it.  The  council  must  be  in  order  in  do-</span><span>  ing  it  If  there  was  a  precedent.</span><span>  To  a  question  Mr.  A.  L.  Lane  (Shire</span><span>  Clerk)  said  that  the  cost  came  out  of</span><span>  the  general  account.  It  would  be  neces-</span><span>  sary  to  have  a  motion  in  connection</span><span>  with  the  matter.  There  would  be  100</span><span>  people  at  the  dinner  at  a  cost  of  5/-</span><span>  a  head.</span><span>  Clr.  Stephens  said  that  if  there  was</span><span>  no  further  discussion  he  would  move</span><span>  that  the  action  of  the  chairman  be</span><span>  endorsed.</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridge:  It  is  a  real  good  ges-</span><span>  ture.  Even  if  a  dinner  has  not  been</span><span>  given  before  there  is  no  harm  in</span><span>  starting  off.  Nobody  could  expect  their</span><span>  chairman  to  pay  for  the  dinner  out  of</span><span>  what  he  was  getting.</span><span>  Clr.  P.  V.  Campbell  said  that  he  was</span><span>  not  aware  of  the  previous  functions.  He</span><span>  noticed  that  other  councils,  particu-</span><span>  larly  Brisbane,  did  it.  He,  for  one,</span><span>  thought  that  the  filming  of  the  picture</span><span>  in  the  district  was  an  asset,  and  he</span><span>  would  not  be  against  any  move.  The</span><span>  occasion  warranted  the  action  taken.</span><span>  Clr.  B.  A.  Ferguson  said  it  was  a  great</span><span>  advertisement  for  the  district  to  have</span><span>  the  people  there.  It  was  a  big  thing,</span><span>  but  it  was  no  fault  of  the  councillors</span><span>  that  the  weather  had  made  an  adverse</span><span>  season.  If  they  made  a  limit  of  the</span><span>  cost  he  was  willing  to  contribute  to</span><span>  make  up  the  extra.</span><span>  Clr.  J.  P.  Deerain  said  he  was  a</span><span>  little  with  Clr.  Ferguson.  He  thought</span><span>  the  councillors  should  start  the  ball</span><span>  rolling,  and  he  was  prepared  to  put  in</span><span>  his  share.  If  each  councillor  put  in  a</span><span>  certain  amount  the  people  could  not</span><span>  say  that  they  had  spent  money  that</span><span>  was  not  their  own.</span><span>  Clr.  Henderson  said  that,  personally,</span><span>  he  was  in  favour  of  it.  Rates  had  gone</span><span>  up  and  then  they  had  the  flood  on</span><span>  top  of  them.  He  was  prepared  to  put</span><span>  In  his  share.</span><span>  After  there  had  been  a  short  consul-</span><span>  tation  at  his  comer  of  the  table.  Clr.</span><span>  Stephens  said  that  in  view  of  remarks</span><span>  passed  it  was  suggested  that  the  coun-</span><span>  cillors  pay  their  allowance  for  the  next</span><span>  two  meetings  to  a  fund  to  go  towards</span><span>  the  function.</span><span>  Clr.  R.  F.  Davis  agreed,  adding  that</span><span>  there  would  be  a  few  kicks  outside.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  if  the  council-</span><span>  lors  thought  that  they  would  be  getting</span><span>  a  kick  there  would  be  no  charge  on  the</span><span>  council.</span><span>  Clr.  Davis:  If  we  forfeit  the  payment</span><span>  for  two  meetings  it  will  be  Â£24.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  at  the  start  he</span><span>  felt  that  there  would  be  an  objection.</span><span>  Originally  he  did  not  realise  that  there</span><span>  were  57  in  the  company.  As  other</span><span>  shires  through  which  the  visitors  pas-</span><span>  sed  had  given  receptions,  It  was  fitting</span><span>  that  the  Beaudesert  Shire  should  do  so,</span><span>  Clr.  Stephens:  We  are  all  agreed  on</span><span>  that.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  there  was  no</span><span>  time  to  wait  until  the  meeting.  He  was</span><span>  not  sure  that  the  council  would  ap-</span><span>  prove,  and  he  was  prepared  to  meet</span><span>  the  cost  himself.  He  would  pay  it  out</span><span>  of  his  allowance.</span><span>  Clr.  Drynan:  Your  allowance  is  not</span><span>  meant  to  meet  such  a  thing.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley:  By  the  size  of  it  I  did</span><span>  not  think  so.  I  think  the  district  will</span><span>  get  a  real  boost  out  of  this.</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridge  said  that  he  was  pre-</span><span>  pared  to  contribute,  but  It  was  not  be-</span><span>  cause  he  was  afraid  of  getting  a  kick</span><span>  from  the  people  who  put  him  In  the</span><span>  council.  He  would  be  in  with  the  others.</span><span>  The  meeting  favoured  the  council-</span><span>  lors  contributing  their  allowance  to</span><span>  meeting  the  cost.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  he  hoped  that</span><span>  the  Beaudesert  ""Times""  would  not</span><span>  print  too  much  about  the  discussion,  as</span><span>  they  did  not  want  it  broadcast  that</span><span>  certain  councillors  were  for  the  dinner,</span><span>  and  others  against  It.</span><span>  Clr.  Stephens  said  that  he  did  not</span><span>  mind  what  he  said  appearing  in  the</span><span>  Press,  but  he  would  not  like  it  to  ap-</span><span>  pear  that  the  dinner  was  given  grudg-</span><span>  ingly.  He  would  like  to  see  the  report</span><span>  of  the  discussion  held  over  for  a  week.</span><span>  Clr.  Henderson  said  that  he  was  not</span><span>  afraid  of  a  kick.</span><span>  Ch\  Stephens:  I  do  not  give  a  fig</span><span>  either.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  explained  that  it  had</span><span>  been  proposed  to  hold  the  function  in</span><span>  the  hall,  and  Mr.  Lane's  idea,  which</span><span>  was  a  good  one,  was  that  It  would  look</span><span>  mercenary  to  make  a  charge  to  pay  for</span><span>  Clr.  Stephens:  That  would  not  have</span><span>  done  at  all.</span></p> <p><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  it  was  then</span><span>  decided  to  make  the  dance  proceeds  go</span><span>  to  worthy  public  bodies.  That  showed</span><span>  that  the  council  was  not  mean.</span><span>  Clr.  Deerain  said  he  was  not  against</span><span>  the  reception.</span><span>  Clr.  Davis  said  the  idea  was  a  good</span><span>  one.  If  the  roads  had  been  good,  the</span><span>  people  would  not  have  taken  objection.</span><span>  He  was  not  afraid  of  the  kicks  but  he</span><span>  could  see  the  point  of  view  of  those,</span><span>  who  could  not  go  to  the  function.</span><span>  The  dinner  was  held  at  the</span><span>  Grand  Hotel  ballroom,  practically</span><span>  the  entire  area  being  taken  up  by</span><span>  tables.  The  attendance  was  94.</span><span>  Following  the  dinner  a  toast  list</span><span>  was  disposed  of.</span><span>  Proposing  the  toast  of  the  guests,</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  he  was  sure  that</span><span>  it  gave  them  great  pleasure  to  have</span><span>  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Chauvel,  and  members</span><span>  of  the  company,  with  them.  The  people  ,</span><span>  were  very  proud  that  they  had  selected</span><span>  the  district,  with  the  National  Park  on</span><span>  its  boundary,  for  the  production  of  the</span><span>  picture.  They  knew  that  the  district</span><span>  had  many  beautiful  spots.  They  knew</span><span>  the  value  of  such  beautiful  country,</span><span>  and  they  were  anxious  to  give  it  all</span><span>  the  publicity  that  they  could.  They</span><span>  knew  of  no  other  way  of  giving  it  the</span><span>  publicity  that  it  was  entitled  to  than</span><span>  by  the  boost  that  the  picture  would</span><span>  give  them.  They  were  getting  a  wonder-</span><span>  ful  boost  by  having  the  picture  taken</span><span>  in  the  district.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  said  that  the  name</span><span>  Chauvel  was  not  new  to  him.  He</span><span>  remembered  it  well.  Mr.  H.  Bruxner</span><span>  was  a  relative  of  the  Chauvel  family.</span><span>  They  were  pleased  to  have  the</span><span>  company  in  the  district,  and  they</span><span>  hoped  that  they  would  have  an  early</span><span>  opportunity  of  witnessing  the  screening</span><span>  of  the  picture.  He  was  sure  that  it</span><span>  would  be  a  good  picture.  They  had</span><span>  some  distinguished  actors  in  the  cast,</span><span>  and  he  was  proud  to  know  that  they</span><span>  had  come  to  the  district  to  do  their</span><span>  work.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley  expressed  best  wishes  for</span><span>  the  success  of  the  picture,  and  said</span><span>  that  the  people  would  follow  every</span><span>  movement  from  one  part  of  the  district</span><span>  to  the  other.  He  knew  the  difficulties</span><span>  they  had  faced  with  bad  weather,  but</span><span>  he  thought  they  were  on  their  feet</span><span>  again,  and  going  hot  and  strong.  He</span><span>  was  sure  that  the  picture  would  be</span><span>  finished  to  schedule.</span><span>  ""We  hope  they  do  their  job</span><span>  thoroughly,  and  well  and,  if  possible,</span><span>  we  hope  that  this  little  gesture  of  ours</span><span>  will  be  some  inspiration  to  you  to  carry</span><span>  on""  added  Clr.  Henley,  who  said  that</span><span>  the  film  had  been  inspired  by  the  books</span><span>  written  by  Bernard  O'Reilly,  who  had</span><span>  lived  within  the  district  for  practically</span><span>  a  lifetime.  It  made  them  feel  that  it  i</span><span>  was  really  their  film.</span><span>  Mr.  A.  G.  Muller  M.L.A.  congrat-</span><span>  ulated  Clr.  Henley  and  the  council  in</span><span>  its  thoughtfulness  in  organising  the</span><span>  function  that  night,  and  for  paying</span><span>  tribute  to  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Chauvel  for</span></p> <p><span>  doing  the  picture  in  the  district.  In</span><span>  the  picture  Mr.  Chauvel  and  his</span><span>  company  were  preparing  history  in  a</span><span>  practical  way.  They  were  proud  to</span><span>  think  that  Mr.  Chauvel  was  producing</span><span>  pictures,  and  they  were  proud,  as  resi-</span><span>  dents  of  the  Fassifern  district,  that  the</span><span>  district  had  produced  Chauvel.  Harris-</span><span>  ville  had  actually  produced  Mr.</span><span>  Chauvel.</span><span>  Mr.  Muller  thanked  Mr.  Chauvel  for</span><span>  the  honour  he  had  done  the  district,</span><span>  and  said  that  he  believed  that  as  a</span><span>  result  he  would  do  more  to  advertise</span><span>  the  district  than  anything  they  could</span><span>  do.  He  congratulated  the  council  on</span><span>  what  it  had  done  that  night.</span><span>  Mr.  T.  Flood  Plunkett  M.L.A.  con-</span><span>  gratulated  the  council  on  extending  the</span><span>  reception  to  the  visitors.  He  did  not</span><span>  know  of  any  occasion  when  a  reception</span><span>  should  be  given  more  heartily,  as  the</span><span>  company  was  doing  something  which</span><span>  would  live  for  all  time.  The  picture</span><span>  would  be  seen  in  all  parts  of  the  world,</span><span>  and  it  would  bring  back  to  the  district</span><span>  something  that  had  happened  before</span><span>  they  were  born.</span><span>  Mr.  Plunkett  paid  a  tribute  to  Mr.</span><span>  O'Reilly,  whom,  he  believed,  had  been</span><span>  an  inspiration  to  get  Mr.  Chauvel  to</span><span>  produce  the  picture  in  the  district.  Mr.</span><span>  Chauvel  was  doing  something  for  the</span><span>  district,  which  he  believed  nobody  else</span><span>  could  do,  and  they  should  be  grateful</span><span>  to  him.  and  should  thank  him  and  his</span><span>  company.  They  had  to  let  people  know</span><span>  what  the  country  was.  They  did  not</span><span>  have  enough  Australian  pictures.  It</span><span>  was  only  men  like  Mr.  Chauvel,  and  his</span><span>  company,  who  were  letting  people  know</span><span>  something  of  the  country  they  lived  in,</span><span>  He  thought  he  could  say  that  it  should</span><span>  be  the  duty  of  them  all  to  give  the</span><span>  company  all  the  assistance  they  pos-</span><span>  sibly  could.  He  hoped  that  it  would  not</span><span>  be  long  before  they  had  the  pleasure</span><span>  of.  seeing  the  picture.</span><span>  ""This  is  a  magnificent  reception  and</span><span>  just  what  the  doctor  ordered.  We  have</span><span>  looked  forward  to  this  function""  said</span><span>  Mr.  Chauvel  in  responding.  He  said</span><span>  that  they  had  been  ushered  in  by  the</span><span>  record  flood,  which  seemed  to  be  some-</span><span>  thing  the  people  were  proud  of.  Some</span><span>  people  told  him  that  when  they  had  a</span><span>  flood  it  was  a  good  one.</span><span>  Mr.  Chauvel  told  how  the  company</span><span>  had  to  secure  the  fire  brigade  pump  to</span><span>  make  rain,  and  how  they  travelled  17</span><span>  miles  to  find  a  boggy  cowyard  for  the</span><span>  picture.  They  went  to  the  property  of</span><span>  Mr.  Reynolds  which  was  beside  a</span><span>  swamp,  and  asked  if  they  could  make</span><span>  a  rain  scene  in  his  cowyard.  Mr.  Rey-</span><span>  nolds  replied  that  they  had  had  all</span><span>  the  rain  they  wanted.  They  got  to</span><span>  work  after  a  good  deal  of  difficulty,</span><span>  and  the  farmer  later  told  them  they</span><span>  produced  the  worst  mud  he  had  ever</span><span>  seen.</span><span>  (Continued  on  page  eight)</span></p> <p><span>  Shire  Council  and  Hospitality</span><span>  (Continued  from  page  one)</span><span>  Mr.  Chauvel  said  they  worked  to  a</span><span>  schedule  which  was  a  nightmare.  They</span><span>  tossed  In  reserve  days  in  case  of  rain,</span><span>  and  they  hoped  that  they  did  not  have</span><span>  to  work  on  Sundays.  They  had  to  keep</span><span>  well  organised  and  well  on  the  ball,  or</span><span>  fall  back.  Mr.  George  Hurst,  who  was</span><span>  in  charge  of  early  arrangements,  had</span><span>  been  through  arduous  times,  building</span><span>  the  homestead.  He  thanked  the  people</span><span>  and  the  council  for  the  assistance  given</span><span>  Mr.  Hurst,  also  the  Show  Society  for</span><span>  making  available  the  show  grounds</span><span>  property.</span><span>  Mr.  Chauvel  said  that  the  Tenter-</span><span>  field  people  gave  then  a  party  on  the</span><span>  way  through,  and  wanted  to  anchor</span><span>  them  there  to  do  some  scenes.  However,</span><span>  they  came  on,  and  they  had  made  fair</span><span>  progress.  The  last  ten  days  had  been</span><span>  terrific  and  the  party  that  night  was</span><span>  something  that  the  doctor  ordered,  and</span><span>  they  appreciated  it.  Speakers  had  re-</span><span>  ferred  to  Bernard  O'Reilly,  which  was</span><span>  a  subject  that  was  dear  to  him.  He</span><span>  hoped  that  they  could  put  the  writings</span><span>  of  Bernard  O'Reilly  into  the  films  and</span><span>  show  the  deephearted  feelings  of  the</span><span>  soil.  They  were  striving  to  put  the</span><span>  feelings  of  Bernard  O'Reilly  on  the</span><span>  screen.</span><span>  After  referring  to  the  beauties  of  the</span><span>  district,  Mr.  Chauvel  said  that  the  film</span><span>  was  backed  by  two  great  organisations,</span><span>  Universal  Pictures  and  Greater  Union</span><span>  Theatres.  The  market  was  wide  for  any</span><span>  of  their  pictures  that  were  well  made.</span><span>  The  speaker  said  that  a  motion  pic-</span><span>  ture  was  not  made  by  one  man,  but  by</span><span>  the  pulling  together  of  a  team.  They</span><span>  had  a  hard  job  ahead  of  them,  as  they</span><span>  were  working  in  a  terrain,  which  was</span><span>  beautiful,  but  rugged  and  tough.  They</span><span>  hoped  the  picture  would  live  up  to  all.</span><span>  their  hopes.  They  hoped  that  the  com-</span><span>  pany  would  be  able  to  capture  some  of</span><span>  the  pioneering  spirit  of  the  people.</span><span>  Mr.  Clive  Wakeham,  of  Universal</span><span>  Pictures,  said  that  Mr.  Chauvel  was</span><span>  one  of  the  outstanding  producers  in</span><span>  Australia,  and  he  was  quite  sure  that</span><span>  the  new  picture  would  be  a  great  suc-</span><span>  cess.  The  district  was  one  of  the  most</span><span>  beautiful  he  had  seen,  and  he  was  sure</span><span>  that  they  were  going  to  see  a  wonder-</span><span>  ful  picture,  and  that  it  would  be  a  real</span><span>  Australian  picture.</span><span>  Speaking  lor  the  technicians,  Mr.</span><span>  Bert  Nicholas  thanked  the  people,  not</span><span>  only  for  their  warm  welcome  that  night</span><span>  but  since  their  arrival  at  Beaudesert.</span><span>  They  hoped  to  help  Mr.  and  Mrs.</span><span>  Chauvel  to  produce  the  best  picture  for</span><span>  the  next  ten  years.  They  were  trying</span><span>  to  show  what  a  wonderful  district  the</span><span>  Beaudesert  people  had.  He  hoped  that</span><span>  when  they  saw  the  picture  the  people</span><span>  would  remember  that  evening  the  same</span><span>  as  the  members  of  the  company  would</span><span>  for  many  years  to  come.</span><span>  Mr.  J.  P.  O'Malley  said  that  most</span><span>  of  the  cast  had  homes  a  long  way  off</span><span>  but  the  people  had  made  them  wel-</span><span>  come.  The  welcome  made  them  feel</span><span>  good  about  being  in  Beaudesert.</span><span>  There  was  a  large  crowd  at  the  dance</span><span>  held  at  the  Technical  Hall,  and  the</span><span>  visitors  were  introduced  by  Mr.  Chau-</span><span>  vel,  and  other  speakers  were  J.

This  was,  a  sur</span><span>  prise  in  view  of  the  strength  of  both</span><span>  teams.  The  match  was  to  have  been</span><span>  played  the  previous  Sunday,  but  it</span><span>  was  postponed  because  of  the  adverse</span><span>  weather  conditions.  The  concrete</span><span>  wicket  at  Selwyn  park  was  selected  .</span><span>  for  the  game.</span><span>  Beaudesert  batted  first,  and  made</span><span>  106  runs,  J.  Moloney  with  4  for  21  off</span><span>  10  overs,  and  C.  Smith  with  3  for  26</span><span>  off  6,  overs  keeping  down  the  score.</span><span>  Top  scorer  was  A.  Draheim  with  24,</span><span>  ana  S.  Callanan  was  next  in  line  with</span><span>  16.</span><span>  Tabooba's  opening  batsman,  C.</span><span>  Smith  scored  74  out  of  Tabooba's  97,</span><span>  the  next  best  score  being  six.  D.</span><span>  Sullivan,  behind  the  stumps,  did  not</span><span>  allow  a  sundry.</span><span>  The  last  wickets  went  at  a  fast  rate,</span><span>  and  the  match  finished  with  about  45</span><span>  minutes  of  play  remaining.  The  dis</span><span>  missal  of  one  wicket  caused  some  com</span><span>  ment,  but  the  explanation  given  was</span><span>  that  the  ball  went  through  the  wickets,</span><span>  and  rebounded  off  the  keeper's  pads,</span><span>  knocking  the  wickets  forward.</span><span>  The  first  ball  was  to  be  bowled  by,</span><span>  Jock  Wright,  but,  in  his  absence,  W.</span><span>  Thwaites  carried  out  this  duty.</span><span>  Scores:</span><span>  Beaudesert:  â  N.

The  hotel  captain  called</span><span>  on  ten  bowlers  (including  tne  umpire),</span><span>  but  efforts  to  shift  Wyatt  faffed.  A</span><span>  'chanceless""  innings  ended,  when  he</span><span>  had  reached  25  as  he  hit  the  wicket</span><span>  with  his  bat.</span><span>  H.  Buss  shaped  very  well  for  12,</span><span>  and  most  of  the  other  ""colts""  showed</span><span>  promise.  Charlie  Efferay  bowled  with</span><span>  all  his  old  skiff,  and  cunning,  and</span><span>  secured  5  for  10.  The  fielding  of  A.</span><span>  Waters  was  outstanding,  and  he  never</span><span>  tired  of  chasing  the  ball,  which  was</span><span>  lucky.</span><span>  Beaudesert  Hotel  batsmen  were  very</span><span>  confident  at  the  start  of  their  innings,</span><span>  but  only  scored  34.  Some  of  the  bats</span><span>  men  shaped  well,  including  J.  E.  Mac-</span><span>  farlane  who  shaped  very  attractively,</span><span>  though  faffing  to  score.  A.  Waters  was</span><span>  unlucky  to  strike  a  straight  one  first</span><span>  ball.  A.  Smith  got  3  for  4  off  one  over.</span><span>  The  Hotel  team  did  much  better  in</span><span>  their  second  innings,  and  scored  106,  S.</span><span>  Barron  hit  lustily  for  19.  W.  Brown</span><span>  retired  at  15.  A.  Waters  had  a  merry</span><span>  time  at  the  wickets  until  the  Motor's</span><span>  captain  again  bowled  a  straight  one.</span><span>  A.  Hiscock  11  and  E.  Wishart  11  also</span><span>  reached  double  figures.</span><span>  The  wicket  keeping  of  R.  L.  Smith,</span><span>  K.  Reeves  and  C.  Spilsbury  for  Motors</span><span>  was  a  feature,  and  they  accomplished</span><span>  a  couple  of  stumpings  that  even  Don</span><span>  Tallon  wouldn't  have  attempted.</span><span>  A  very  enjoyable  day  was  had  by  all,</span><span>  although  it  is  reported  that  there  was</span><span>  a  few  cases  of  painful  muscles  on</span><span>  Sunday.</span><span>  Scores:</span><span>  Beaudesert  Hotel  1st  innings:  A.</span><span>  Crisp  b.

Light  showers  in  the  after</span><span>  noon  did  not  hold  up  play.</span><span>  Beaudesert  decided  to  bat,  after  win</span><span>  ning  the  toss,  and  their  opponents  were</span><span>  soon  sending  down  a  sodden  ball.  Mc-</span><span>  Kenzie,  who  has  been  establishing  great</span><span>  figures  of  late,  was  not  able  to  make</span><span>  the  best  of  the  leather,  and  he  was  not</span><span>  seen  at  his  best,  getting  2  for  57  off  13</span><span>  overs.</span><span>  .  Beaudesert  stayed  at  the  wicket  for</span><span>  184  minutes,  and  made  189  runs.  Bishop</span><span>  batted  nicely  for  51,  taking  51  minutes</span><span>  to  do  this.  He  was  a  stumbling  block</span><span>  to  the  opposition,  and  he  and  C.  Moss</span><span>  established  a  partnership  of  -71  in  31</span><span>  minutes.  Moss  gave  an  excellent  dis</span><span>  play,  to  finish  with  70  in  88  minutes.</span><span>  Moss  lost  his  wicket  when  his  side</span><span>  had  158  on  the  board,  and,  as  time  was</span><span>  advancing,  the  remainder  of  the  side</span><span>  went  for  the  runs,  to  lose  their  wickets</span><span>  at  a  fast  rate.</span><span>  Christmas  Creek  met  early  disaster,</span><span>  and  did  not  settle  down,  being  all  out</span><span>  for  only  18,  their  innings  lasting  44</span><span>  minutes.  There  had  been  a  break  in</span><span>  the  weather,  and  the  ground  had  dried</span><span>  out  somewhat  when  the  country  side</span><span>  went  in.  J.  Brosnan  and  E.  Piatt  made</span><span>  merry,  the  former  taking  eight  wickets</span><span>  for  6  runs  off  4.4  overs.  In  that  he  won</span><span>  two  wickets  in  succession  on  two  occa</span><span>  sions,  missing  the  hat  trick  twice.  Piatt</span><span>  bowled  2  for  10.</span><span>  It  was  only  fitting  that  Brosnan</span><span>  should  be  chaired  off  the  field  by  his</span><span>  team  mates,  this  performance  being</span><span>  outstanding.</span><span>  Beaudesert  sent  their  opponents  in</span><span>  again,  and,  when  play  ceased,  they  had</span><span>  3  down  for  94  runs.  T.  Todd  carrying</span><span>  his  bat  for  32,  and  R.  McKenzie  being</span><span>  unconquered  with  30.</span><span>  The  teams  will  meet  on  Sunday  week.</span><span>  On  yesterday's  results  Beaudesert</span><span>  should  be  easy  winners,  although  some</span><span>  of  their  players  consider  that  weather</span><span>  conditions  had  a  big  bearing  on  the</span><span>  outcome,  and  that  they  were  the  luckier</span><span>  side  in  this  regard.</span><span>  Beaudesert  Club's  A  grade  team  won</span><span>  the  premiership  in  its  grade,  it  being</span><span>  the  first  occasion  for  many  seasons</span><span>  that  this  has  happened,  and  it  must</span><span>  be  considered  that  the  prospects  are</span><span>  reasonable  for  the  club  to  gain  the</span><span>  double.</span><span>  Sunday's  results  are:</span><span>  BEAUDESERT  First  Innings:  H.</span><span>  Watkins.  run  out  9;  J.

This  resulted  in  the</span><span>  last  race  being  run  well  behind</span><span>  |  schedule.  c</span><span>  George  Dyer's  Solwong,  badly  placed</span><span>  '  in  the  early  running,  came  into  prom</span><span>  inence  as  the  field  swung  to  the</span><span>  straight,  and  ran  into  second  place</span><span>  hi  tne  First  Division  of  the  Handicap</span><span>  Hack  race.  The  2/1  favorite,  Tampico,</span><span>  won  by  four  lengths,  and  earned  the</span><span>  support  of  followers.  There  was  also</span><span>  money  for  Deer  Force  and  Black  Fal.</span><span>  Liberty  Gold  was  first  away  from</span><span>  Jedar,  and  they  were  still  in  control</span><span>  with  two  furlongs  to  go.  Tampico  was</span><span>  in  charge  into  the  straight,  and  won</span><span>  well.  Black  Pal  was  third,  with  Jedar</span><span>  fourth,  and  Deer  Force  next.  There</span><span>  was  a  false  start,  due  to  Liberty  Gold</span><span>  putting  his  head  over  the  barrier  as</span><span>  Starter  W.  Hill  was  about  to  send  them</span><span>  away.</span><span>  Red  Dawn,  backed  down  to  6/4  on</span><span>  favoritism,  in  the  Second  Division  of</span><span>  the  Hack  Division,  was  not  as  good  as</span><span>  anticipated,  and  went  down  by  a  lenght</span><span>  and  a  half,  to  Bekadee,  who  started  at</span><span>  fives.  It  was  a  good  race  between  three</span><span>  of  them  as  they  came  up  the  straight,</span><span>  but  they  sorted  themselves  out.  Gay</span><span>  Athol  was  fourth  to  Garrio's  Double.</span><span>  Vantona  jumped  away  at  the  barrier</span><span>  at  the  start  of  the  Fifth  Division,  and</span><span>  led  all  the  way,  the  margin  of  five</span><span>  lengths  at  some  stages  being  reduced</span><span>  to  a  length  and  a  quarter  at  the  judge.</span><span>  Vantona  was  a  two  to  one  favorite,</span><span>  with  Junior  next  at  threes.  Bungar-</span><span>  ribee  chased  the  leader  for  a  consider</span><span>  able  distance,  but  petered  out  in  the</span><span>  straight,  and  finished  fourth,  with</span><span>  Assembly  second  and  Wllga  Power</span><span>  third.</span><span>  Two  horses  started  equal  favorites  at</span><span>  fours,  and  three  at  fives,  in  a  field  of</span><span>  nine  in  the  Fourth  Division  over  six</span><span>  furlongs.  There  was  money  for  the</span><span>  lot  of  them.  Halo  Girl  was  first  away,</span><span>  but  Panrig  took  the  front  from  Marn-</span><span>  buz.  The  latter  was  in  front  with  three</span><span>  furlongs  to  go,  .  and  had  no  trouble</span><span>  to  win  by  three  lengths  at  fives  with</span><span>  two  between  Almarch  (7)  and  Panrig</span><span>  (5).</span><span>  Cornish  Castle  made  the  pace  in  the</span><span>  early  stages  of  the  First  Division  of</span><span>  the  Sixth  Division,  and  still  had  suf</span><span>  ficient  in  hand  to  finish  easily  with</span><span>  a  length  and  a  half  to  spare  from</span><span>  Duraldi.  It  was  a  close  race  for  third,</span><span>  Dominica  just  beating  off  Garrio's</span><span>  Double  by  n  head.  The  first  two  horses</span><span>  disputed  favoritism  at  5  to  2.  with  My</span><span>  Mark  next  in  demand  at  threes.</span><span>  The  4  to  1  Cunnyanna  came  to  light</span><span>  over  the  final  distance  of  the  Second</span><span>  Division  of  the  Sixth  Division,  and</span><span>  took  the  race,  with  Regular  Ad  second,</span><span>  and  Lacings,  who  was  well  back,  but</span><span>  who  finished  at  a  fast  rate,  making</span><span>  third  place  a  head  worse.  Lacings  was</span><span>  sent  out  a  2  to  1  favorite.</span><span>  There  was  an  upset-  in  the  Seventh</span><span>  Division  of  six  furlongs,  when  Admiral</span><span>  Rous,  sent  out  at  14  to  1,  showed  a</span><span>  clean  pair  of  heels  to  Stand  There,</span><span>  who  was  so  strongly  supported  that</span><span>  he  was  backed  down  to  5  to  4  on.</span><span>  Admiral  Rous  did  not  look  like  getting</span><span>  beaten.  For  several  furlongs  Forest</span><span>  Trader  was  lying  liandy  to  him.</span><span>  Bekadee,  2  to  1  favourite  for  the</span><span>  Eighth  Division,  led  most  of  the  way,</span><span>  but  lost  his  position  in  the  straight.</span><span>  A  great  finish,  the  race  was  won  by</span><span>  Maranthona,  who  took  victory  by  a</span><span>  head,  with  a  short  hend  from  Mulaban,</span><span>  who  had  awa.vs  been  handy  to  Bekadee.</span><span>  Auvifous  Find  was  fourth.</span><span>  Results:</span><span>  Handicap  Hack  Race,  (First  Div.)  :</span><span>  TAMPICO  8.5  (E.

"<p><span>  BEAUDESERT  RACES</span></p> <p><span>  Due,  no  doubt  to  following  so</span><span>  closely  on  the  Easter  racing  carni</span><span>  val  and  holidays,  the  attendance  at</span><span>  the  Beaudesert  and  District  Ama-</span></p> <p><span>  teur  Race  Club's  meeting  at  the</span><span>  Eelbogan  course  on  Wednesday  was</span><span>  not  up  to  standard,  the  gate  tak</span><span>  ings  being  close  to  Â£500,  whicli  is</span><span>  about  Â£100  short  of  the  usual  con</span><span>  tribution  of  the  public.</span><span>  The  racing  was  good,  with  some</span><span>  long  ""shots""  coming  home  in  good</span><span>  style,  much  to  the  delight  of  some</span><span>  of  the  95  bookmakers  who  fielded,</span><span>  and  who  lost  heavily  when  the</span><span>  solidly  backed  Solveig  was  ridden</span><span>  to  victory  by  Jockey  E.  Conquest.</span><span>  Although  the  meeting  was  a.  ""post</span><span>  poned""  one,  having  been  deferred  a</span><span>  week  because  of  rain,  the  fields  were</span><span>  comparatively  good,  there  being  good</span><span>  representation  In  all  eight  events.  In  all</span><span>  66  started  with  two  races  of  ten  each.</span><span>  A  pleasing  feature  was  the  number</span><span>  of  horses  trained  in  the  district  that</span><span>  raced  during  the  afternoon.</span><span>  The  stewards  had  a  busy  time.  They</span><span>  were  called  on  to  hear  one  protest,</span><span>  which  did  not  take  long  to  decide.  In</span><span>  two  races  Mr.  G.  Hunter,  stipendiary</span><span>  steward,  drew  attention  to  the  state  of</span><span>  the  market,  the  second  incident  in</span><span>  volving  one  rider  only.</span><span>  Jockeys  Genn  and  Johanscn,  riding</span><span>  Young  Komachi  and  Hendra  Boy,  re</span><span>  spectively.  were  lold  after  the  first  race</span><span>  that  they  had  been  involved  in  slight</span><span>  interference,  and  that  they  had  to  be</span><span>  more  careful  in  the  future.</span><span>  Harold  Ludwig  started  off  very  well</span><span>  by  taking  the  opening  event  of  the  pro</span><span>  gramme,  the  First  Division  -of  the  Hack</span><span>  Division  with  Rivopal.  Other  than</span><span>  stable  followers  did  not  give  the  mare</span><span>  a  chance,  as  some  of  them  claimed</span><span>  that  she  was  too  heavy.  Silk  Store  was</span><span>  made  a  favourite  at  twos,  with  My</span><span>  Mark  next  in  demand  at  7  to  2,  with</span><span>  sixes  about  Rivopal.  Rivopal,  having</span><span>  her  first  start  for  six  months,  after  be</span><span>  ing  in  the  paddock  for  three  months,</span><span>  and  only  being  back  in  feed  for  seven</span><span>  weeks,  made  no  mistake,  and  had  plenty</span><span>  In  hand  to  win  by  three-quarters  of  a</span><span>  length,  with  Harry  Dauth's  charge.  My</span><span>  Mark,  a  neck  better  than  the  favourite.</span><span>  Rivopal  was  in  front  after  ihey  had</span><span>  covered  a  furlong,  and  at  the  home</span><span>  turn  had  a  length  and  a  half  to  spare.</span><span>  Nothing  else  had  a  chance  the  way  she</span><span>  handled  the  straight.  The  owner  was</span><span>  showered  with  congratulations  on  his</span><span>  success,  because,  until  she  went  to  spell,</span><span>  Rivopal  had  a  great  run  of  successes,</span><span>  which  brought  her  to  top  weight  marks.</span><span>  She  carried  10.6  on  Wednesday  with</span><span>  ease.  Jockey  J.  Mohr,  who  is  attached</span><span>  to  the  stables,  handled  her  well.</span><span>  Jockey  Mohr  rode  Harold's  Pride  into</span><span>  a  good  position  in  the  Second  Division</span><span>  of  the  Hack  race.  At  one  stage  he  was</span><span>  going  well,  but  petered  out  In  the</span><span>  straight.  Consequence,  3  to  1  equal</span><span>  favourite  with  Prince  Ted,  fought  out</span><span>  the  final  distance  with  that  horse,  and</span><span>  won  by  a  short  head.  The  other  Beau-</span><span>  desert  entry,  Beaucot,  was  three-</span><span>  quarters  of  a  length  worse.  Beaucot  is</span><span>  owned  and  trained  by  C.  Abberdan.</span></p> <p><span>  Consequence  caused  a  stir  when</span><span>  coming  back  to  the  enclosure.  He  gal</span><span>  loped  up  the  straight,  and  got  out  of</span><span>  control.  Jockey  W.  Brown  almost  lost</span><span>  his  seat  on  one  side,  and  then  swung</span><span>  back,  and  held  on  long  enough  to</span><span>  bring  his  mount  to  a  standstill.  He</span><span>  went  close  to  being  thrown  on  to  the</span><span>  picket  fence.</span><span>  Fortunes  fluctuated  in  the  seven  fur</span><span>  long  race,  the  Foucth  Division.  Atcher-</span><span>  ley  was  the  early  leader,  and  his  fol</span><span>  lowers,  who  had  made  him  a  5  to  2  fav</span><span>  ourite  took  heart,  but  he  faded  out.</span><span>  Gain  Midas  was  another  that  gave  pro</span><span>  mise,  but  when  the  pressure  was  on,</span><span>  faded  out.  Sponsor  did  well  to  win  by</span><span>  li  lengths  from  the  fast  finishing  Blue</span><span>  Cap,  after  being  in  'the  middle  of  the</span><span>  field  for  the  greater  part  of  the  dis</span><span>  tance.</span><span>  Woodleigh  cleared  away,  and,  after</span></p> <p><span>  leading  by  four  lengths  at  one  stage,</span><span>  won  the  Fifth  Division  by  two  lengths</span><span>  from  the  even  money  Court  Ruler.  The</span><span>  winner  started  at  eights.  Prior  to  the</span><span>  start  Stipendiary  G.  Hunter  had  words</span><span>  with  three  of  the  jockeys,  including  the</span><span>  winner,  and  informed  them  he  was  not</span><span>  satisfied  with  the  ""market.""</span><span>  Jockey  J.  Elder,  rider  of  Golden  Ruf</span><span>  fian,  who  was  beaten  a  length  in  the</span><span>  First  Division  of  the  Sixth  Division,  by</span><span>  Glenungra,  lodged  a  protest  against  the</span><span>  winner,  alleging  interference.  After</span><span>  evidence  was  heard  the  protest  was  dis</span><span>  missed.  The  even  money  Sleepy  Hybol</span><span>  led  to  the  two  furlongs  pole,  when</span><span>  Beau  Eye  hit  the  front.  Glenungra,</span><span>  who  was  wide  at  the  turn,  was  carried</span><span>  out.  but  came  good.</span><span>  Although  moderately  placed  in  the</span><span>  running,  until  the  field  made  the  home</span><span>  turn,  Solveig,  who  started  at  5  to  4  on,</span><span>  went  on  to  win  the  Second  Division  of</span><span>  the  Sixth  Division  in  good  style,  hav</span><span>  ing  three  lengths  to  spare.  Pen  William</span><span>  was  always  handy  out  wide,  and  made</span><span>  third  place  two  lengths  .  behind  En</span><span>  thusiast,  with  Elatos  handy  fourth.</span><span>  Millard,  ridden  by  Ashley  Burgess,</span><span>  broke  through  the  barrier  prior  to  the</span><span>  start  of  the  First  Division  of  the</span><span>  Seventh  Division.

The  Lockyer  is</span><span>  an  outstanding  example.</span><span>  The  governments  of  today  have  professed  interest  in  water  and</span><span>  fodder  conservation  schemes,  and  from  time  to  time  interesting  state</span><span>  ments  have  been  issued,  but  it  appears  that  it  will  be  some  time  before</span><span>  anything  concrete  is  done.  Many  parts  of  Queensland  are  embraced,</span><span>  but  all  cannot,  and  will  not,  be  given  a  scheme  at  the  same  time.</span><span>  j  Those  who  show  interest,  and  put  their  case  before  the  Queensland</span><span>  'Government,  might  be  given  priority  over  those  that  are  apparently</span><span>  dormant.  That  is  why  the  Beaudesert  District  should  form  an  organ</span><span>  isation,  and  keep  up  an  agitation,  not  taking  ""No""  for  an  answer.</span><span>  The  idea  of  calling  a  public  meeting  does  not  appeal,  as  the  majority</span><span>  of  people  decide  to  leave  the  matter  to  the  other  fellow,  unless  their</span><span>  pockets  are  directly  hit  at  the  particular  time.</span><span>  It  would  be  better  to  call  for  delegates  from  bodies,  such  as  the</span><span>  Beaudesert  Shire  Council,  and  Chamber  of  Commerce,  A.L.P.,  Develop</span><span>  mental  League,  with  very  strong  representation  from  the  Logan  and</span><span>  Albert  Sub-district  Executive  of  the  Q.D.O.,  the  Logan  and  Albert</span><span>  Co-operative  Dairy  Association,  and  Beaudesert  Branch  of  the  Graziers</span><span>  Association,  with  small  crop  growers  getting  together  to  put  forward</span><span>  their  views.  s  '</span><span>  And  the  organisation,  will  not  get  far  unless  it  hand  picks  its  mem</span><span>  bers.  It  should  not  be  a  case  of  putting  forward  a  man  because  he  is</span><span>  the  leader  of  his  particular  body,  in  the  hope  that  he  will  throw  his</span><span>  weight  behind  the  move,  but  of  choosing  an  enthusiast  who  will  devote</span><span>  his  spare  time  and  energies  to  helping  along  the  new  body.  Naturally</span><span>  this  fits  some  of  the  leaders  of  district  organisations,  but  it  might  be</span><span>  found  that  others  cannot  give  the  time.  It  will  not  be  fair  to  force</span><span>  people  who  cannot  give  the  time  to  something  that  needs  drive,  if  the</span><span>  district  is  to  get  anywhere.</span><span>  It  seems  that  money  will  be  made  available  for  those  prepared  to</span><span>  help  once  the  Government  completes  its  plans,  and  why  should  not</span><span>  the  Beaudesert  District  be  one  of  the  first  selected?  It  has  all  the</span><span>  necessary  qualifications,  and  should  be  given  priority,  but  it  will  be  no</span><span>  use  complaining  after  we  are  left  out.  i</span><span>  At  the  present  time  Brisbane  is  hungry  for  fruit  and  vegetables  that</span><span>  can  be  retailed  at  a  reasonable  price  so  that  the  rank  and  file  can</span><span>  give  its  children  health-giving  food,  and  Beaudesert  is  only  a  little</span><span>  over  an  hour's  motor  run  from  the  city  itself.</span><span>  There  has  also  been  a  serious  shortage  of  milk,  which  has  caused</span><span>  concern,  but  if  the  Logan  and  Albert  Rivers  had  been  weired,  and</span><span>  water  schemes  provided,  stock  would  have  been  able  to  maintain  pro</span><span>  duction  and  the  market  satisfied,  no  matter  how  great  the  demand.</span><span>  Beaudesert  has  all  the  essentials  to  make  it  a  valuable  producing</span><span>  area  because  it  has  rich  soil  and  water  courses,  it  is  close  to  the</span><span>  State's  best  market,  and  now  it  is  up  to  its  people  to  fight  for  its</span><span>  'natural  heritage,  which  will  open  a  new  era,  with  which  will  be  asso</span><span>  ciated  that  necessary  expansionâ  closer  settlement.</span></p> ",Article,1947-02-07,FIGHT FOR OUR RIGHTS,216077777,2,2,"{'score': '545.8778', 'value': 'very relevant'}","THE Beaudesert ""Times"" commends to district organisations the suggestion of Mr. A.

People  wanted  the</span><span>  quickest  outlet  to  the  sea.</span><span>  Mr.  Kelly  advised  residents  to</span><span>  press  for  (he  construction  of  a  road</span><span>  over  the  bad  sections.</span></p> <p><span>  Clr.  Aldridge  said  he  thought  the  set</span><span>  of  steps  came  inside  the  ova..</span><span>  Mr.  Cochrane  said  that  the  oval  had</span><span>  been  marked,  but  he  did  not  know  il</span><span>  this  was  correct.  There  should  be  10ft.</span><span>  from  the  toe  of  the  ramp  to  the  cor</span><span>  rect  boundary.</span><span>  Clr.  Henley:  There  has  been  some</span><span>  talk  about  the  stand  being  in  the</span><span>  wrong  place,  but  I  think  it  is  exactly</span><span>  where  it  should  be.  It  is  on  the  right</span><span>  spot.  When  the  sun  is  going  down  the</span><span>  ramp  is  shaded  by  the  pavilion.  The</span><span>  money  lias  been  well  spent.  Any  coun</span><span>  cillor  there  on  Sunday  should  have</span><span>  been  proud  to  see  what  has  been  done.</span><span>  The  two  wickets  were  fully  occupied,</span><span>  and  there  were  many  spectators.  War</span><span>  wick  bowlers  were  being  entertained  at</span><span>  bowls,  and  the  whole  area  looked  nice.</span><span>  I  think  the  council  has  done  a  great  job</span><span>  helping  the  sporting  public  to  occupy</span><span>  themselves  the  right  way  on  Sundays.</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridge  said  there  seemed  to  he</span><span>  a  mixup  over  the  ownership  of  the</span><span>  heavy  iron  roller.  It  was  thou  (lit  that</span><span>  this  was  owned  by  the  Race  Club.</span><span>  Several  councillors:  No,  it  belongs</span><span>  to  the  council.</span><span>  Clr.  Aldridge  said  that  it  was  just</span><span>  lucky  that  Mr.  R.  Ferguson,  the  cura</span><span>  tor,  noticed  that  it  was  missing,  or  he</span><span>  would  have  watered  the  wicket,  and</span><span>  then  they  would  not  hhve  been  able  to</span><span>  t-kloir  rttt  if  Ua  ihniifvhf  tho  nnnnpil</span></p> <p><span>  should  give  advice  if  the  roller  was</span><span>  taken  away.</span><span>  Clr.  E.  M.  Tilley:  It  is  the  first  inti</span><span>  mation  I  have  had  that  the  heavy  rol</span><span>  ler  is  used  on  the  wicket.  It  has  been</span><span>  the  habit  to  use  the  concrete  roller.</span><span>  Mr.  J.  S.  Cochrane  (Engineer)  said</span><span>  he  was  responsible  for  taking  the  roller</span><span>  away.  He  had  been  told  that  was  use</span><span>  less  on  the  wicket  because  it  caused</span><span>  _  waves.  He  thought  it  was  the  first  time</span><span>  the  roller  had  been  used  by  the  council</span><span>  for  years.</span><span>  Asked  further  questions  Mr.  Coch</span><span>  rane  said  that  everybody  wanting  the</span><span>  use  of  the  roller  used  it.</span><span>  Clr.  P.  W.  Everdell  said  the  race  club</span><span>  never  pretended  to  own  it.  It  was  used</span><span>  at  the  course,  and  it  disappeared,  and</span><span>  was  next  seen  at  the  tennis  courts  near</span><span>  the  park.</span><span>  When  the  matter  of  income  for</span><span>  cricket  was  mentioned.  Clr.  Tilley  said</span><span>  that  the  cricketers  did  not  seem  to  have</span><span>  the  same  organisation  as  the  footba1-</span><span>  lers,  and.  until  they  had,  they  would</span><span>  always  be  in  the  doldrums.</span><span>  Clr.  Stephens  said  cricketers  thought</span><span>  the  roller  belonged  to  the  race  club.</span><span>  So  that  the  matter  would  be  sorted</span><span>  out  it  was  decided  that  the  cricketers</span><span>  be  advised  that  the  council  owned  the</span><span>  roller,  and  that  it  would  be  available  on</span><span>  application  to  the  engineer.</span></p> ",Article,1947-10-24,OUTLET TO THE SEA,216077971,4,4,"{'score': '372.8486', 'value': 'very relevant'}",Not only Boonah District residents want the road connecting Boonah and Beaudesert made an all weather road.,"{'id': '1064', 'value': 'The Beaudesert Times (Qld. : 1908 - 1954)'}",https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/216077971?searchTerm=%27The+Beaudesert+Times%27,/newspaper/216077971,The Beaudesert Times (Qld. : 1908 - 1954),1064
