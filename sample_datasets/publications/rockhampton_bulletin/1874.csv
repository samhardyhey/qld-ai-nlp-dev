If  certain  returns</span></p> <p><span>  just  laid  before  Parliament  lie  believed,  |</span><span>  the  public  expenditure  on  ordinary</span></p> <p><span>  revenue  account  lo  the  northward  of</span></p> <p><span>  Cape  Palmerston  was  last  year  at  the</span><span>  rate  of  £6  los.  iod.  per  head  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  population,  while  to  the  southward  of  j</span><span>  that  point  it  was  only  at  the  rate  of  £3</span></p> <p><span>  2s.  7&lt;i.  This,  however,  is  exclusive  of  j</span><span>  interest  and  expenses  of  the  department,</span></p> <p><span>  which  items  being  taken  into  account  !</span><span>  leave  the  comparative  expenditure  as</span><span>  follows  :-North  of  Cape  Palmerston  at</span><span>  the  rate  of  12s.  7d.  per  head;  south,</span></p> <p><span>  jQ6  4s.  yd.  per  head.  These  figures  1</span><span>  appear  sufficiently  startling,  and  no  doubt</span><span>  the  hope  is  that  they  will  effectually</span><span>  silence  the  northern  members.  But  we  i</span><span>  shall  be  much  mistaken  if  this  be  the</span><span>  case,  for  a  little  examination  of  the</span><span>  TREASURER'S  figures  shows  that  in  this</span></p> <p><span>  case  they  do  not  tell  the  whole  truth,  j</span></p> <p><span>  The  total  amount  paid  last  year  as</span></p> <p><span>  interest  upon  the  public  debt  and,</span><span>  on  account  of  sinking  fund,  is  shown  !</span><span>  to  have  been  ^248,173.  Of  this  j</span><span>  however,  only  ¿JiSSG  was  for  loan</span><span>  moneys  actually  spent  in  the  north,  while  j</span><span>  .-£152,753  was  on  accountofloan  moneys  I</span></p> <p><span>  spent  in  the  south.  But  no  less  than</span></p> <p><span>  ¿93,498  was  absorbed  in  interest  upon  j</span></p> <p><span>  loans  of  general  account,  and  of  this  the</span><span>  north  is  charged  with  its  full  share,</span><span>  whereas  nearly  the  whole  of  the  amount</span><span>  should  have  been  debited  lo  the  south.</span><span>  For  example,  there  was  a  loss  of</span><span>  ,£209,977  incurred  in  negociating  the</span></p> <p><span>  various  loans  of  the  colony,  but,  seeing  I</span><span>  that  thc  north  scarcely  participated  at  all</span><span>  in  the  expenditure  of  those  loans,  it  cannot</span><span>  bc  fairly  charged  with  a  pro  rata  share  in  the</span><span>  interest  upon  the  deficit.  However,  it</span><span>  must  be  admitted  that  lhere  has  been</span><span>  rather  a  large  expenditure  in  the  matter</span><span>  for  the  past  year  or  two,  and  that  lhere</span><span>  is  much  less  reason  for  complaint  on  this</span><span>  head  now  than  formerly.  Thc  late</span><span>  Government,  although  failing  to  pass</span></p> <p><span>  their  Financial  Separation  Bil!,  succeeded  |</span><span>  in  apportioning  thc  public  expenditure</span><span>  with  a  kind  of  rough  justice  which  ought</span><span>  to  have  secured  for  them  the  gratitude</span><span>  instead  of  the  ill-will  of  the  northern</span><span>  people,  whose  representatives  have,</span><span>  strangely  enough,  since  thrown  in  their</span><span>  lot  with  a  party  whose  policy  it  has</span><span>  always  been  to  deny  justice  to  the  north.</span><span>  Taking  the  TREASURER'S  figures  as  they</span><span>  stand  there  is  little  ground  for  complaint,</span></p> <p><span>  but  when  it  is  recollected  that  the  revenue</span><span>  contributed  per  head  by  the  adult  males</span><span>  of  the  north  is  largely  in  excess  of  the</span><span>  mixed  population  of  the  south  the  sub-</span><span>  ject  wears  a  different  aspect.  The</span><span>  return,  therefore,  ts  really  not  of  much</span><span>  value,  especially  when  it  is  remembered</span><span>  that  the  Wide  Bay  and  Burnett  and  the</span><span>  Central  Districts  are  thrown  in  with  the</span><span>  south,  and  thus  keep  down  the  ratable</span><span>  expenditure  per  head  for  the  whole  of</span><span>  that  part  of  the  colony  lying  lo  the</span><span>  southward  of  Cape  Palmerston.  There</span><span>  is  nothing  in  the  figures  just  published  to</span><span>  disprove  the  fact  that  apart  from</span><span>  the  large  expenditure  on  departmental</span><span>  account  in  the  metropolitan  districts,</span><span>  they  also  have  managed  to  secure  far</span><span>  more  than  their  proportionate  share  of</span><span>  the  moneys  available  for  local  purposes.</span><span>  The  return  prepared  under  Mr.  PAI.MKR'S</span><span>  Financial  Separation  Bill  is  conclusive</span><span>  on  this  point,  and  we  shall  prefer  those</span><span>  figures  to  the  cleverly-prepared  tables  on</span><span>  which  the  TREASURER  attempts  to  prove</span><span>  his  case,  and  to  make  the  public  believe</span><span>  that  thc  sooner  Separation  at  Cape  Pal-</span><span>  merston  is  accomplished  the  better  for</span><span>  the  districts  to  the  south  of  that  point.</span></p> <p><span>  TiiKUK  wiva  an  excellent  house  at  the</span><span>  Theatre  Royal  last  night,  when  the  sensational</span><span>  drama  of  ""East  Ly  imo  ""  was  repeated,  Miss.</span><span>  Gougonhcim  of  course  playing  the  characters</span><span>  of  Litli/  Isabel  Carlyle  and  Madams  Vine.</span><span>  The  artiste  was  as  successful  with  her  im-</span><span>  personation  of  tho  difficult  and  arduous</span><span>  characters  as  she  was  on  tho  previous  cvcuini;,</span><span>  and  deep  were  thc  expressions  of  applause</span><span>  that  escaped  from  time  to  time  from  tho</span><span>  breasts  of  tho  really  affected  specta-</span><span>  tors  when  souic  expression  of  remorse</span><span>  and  agony  more  intense  than  usual  was</span><span>  forced  from  the  woman  whose  jealousy  the</span><span>  author  liai  linde  tn  rival  even  that  ot  Othello.</span><span>  Tho  jealous  but  honorable  Moor  of  Venice  took</span><span>  human  life,  the  Lndg  Isabel  Carlyle  &lt;li.I</span><span>  something  more  revolting,  and  was  adequately</span><span>  punished.

Hut  judging  by  the  carelessness</span><span>  usually  evinced  when  the  new  electoral</span><span>  rolls  are  in  preparation,  the  grievance  of</span></p> <p><span>  which  so  much  is  heard  from  election-</span></p> <p><span>  eering  platforms,  is  little  else  than  a</span><span>  sentimental  one.  livery  year,  as  the</span><span>  time  for  revising  the  roll  and  for  adding</span><span>  new  names  to  it  comes  round,  the  Press</span><span>  takes  up  the  cry,  ""  Register!  Register!""</span><span>  and  most  industriously  impresses  upon  the</span><span>  public  the  necessity  of  a  full  and  free</span><span>  exercise  of  their  political  privileges.</span><span>  Yet  in  very  many  cases  the  qualifiée!</span><span>  citizen  deems  the  labour  of  regis-</span><span>  tration  too  great  to  be  encountered,</span><span>  and  prefers  to  remain  amongst  the</span><span>  numerous  class  of  non-electors  rather</span><span>  than  devoto  an  hour  or  two  to  making</span><span>  good  his  qualification.  For  he  it  re-</span><span>  membered,  the  claim  has  lo  be  made  and</span><span>  substantiated  but  once,  and  the  elector's</span><span>  name  is  afterwards  transferred  to  the  new</span></p> <p><span>  roll  year  by  year.  Of  course  it  is  requisite</span><span>  tiiat  he  should  keep  a  watch  upon  the</span><span>  preliminary  lists  each  year,  and  par-</span><span>  ticularly  so  on  an  occasion  like  the  last,</span></p> <p><span>  when  the  re-distribution  of  electorates</span></p> <p><span>  and  the  consequent  splitting  of  rolls  led</span><span>  to  many  great  mistakes.  Bul  redistri-</span><span>  bution  is  a  rare  occurrence,  and  the</span><span>  elector  usually  finds  that,  once  duly</span><span>  placed  on  a  roll,  his  name  permanently</span><span>  remains  there.  Looked  at  in  this  light,</span><span>  the  trouble  caused  by  our  system  of</span><span>  self-registration  is  a  difficulty  which  no</span></p> <p><span>  man  of  common  sense  should  rank</span></p> <p><span>  among  political  grievances.  If,  however,</span><span>  as  »ve  witnessed  last  year,  impediments</span><span>  are  thrown  in  the  way  of  registration</span><span>  which  were  never  contemplated  by  the</span><span>  Legislature,  the  disfranchised  citizen  bas</span><span>  cause  for  legitimate  complaint,  and  it</span><span>  behoves  all  public-spirited  colonists  to</span><span>  insist,  at  the  proper  time,  that  the  law</span><span>  shall  hereafter  be  interpreted  in  an</span><span>  enlightened  and  liberal  spirit.  The</span><span>  Elections  Act  of  1872  was  manifestly</span><span>  intended  to  be  an  enfranchising</span><span>  statute,  and  therefore  in  case  of  doubt</span><span>  as  to  its  interpretation  on  technical  points,</span></p> <p><span>  the  scale  should  be  turned  in  favour  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  applicant,  lt  is  notorious  that  some</span><span>  of  the  Revision  Cout  ts  in  this  part  of  the</span><span>  colony  acted  in  a  manner  directly  the</span><span>  opposite  of  this  last  year,  and  conse-</span><span>  quently  that  numbers  of  our  most</span><span>  worthy  colonists  were  improperly  pre-</span><span>  vented  from  exercising  their  statutory</span><span>  rights.</span></p> <p><span>  To-day  the  quarter  of  the  year  begins</span><span>  during  which  applications  for  enrolment</span><span>  may  be  forwarded  to  the  clerk  of  petty</span><span>  sessions.  These  must  be  sent,  not  as  in</span><span>  former  times  lo  the  nearest  clerk,  but  lo</span><span>  one  whose  office  is  within  the  boundary</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  electoral  district  in  which</span></p> <p><span>  enrolment  is  desired.  As  is  pretty  well</span><span>  understood  now,  the  application  must  be</span><span>  accompanied  by  a  solemn  declaration  of</span><span>  correctness,  made  before  some  magis-</span><span>  trate  of  the  territory,  who  in  turn  is</span><span>  required  to  certify  that  ""  to  thc  best  of</span><span>  my  knowledge  and  belief  the  same  is</span><span>  correct.""  Having  done  so  much,  how-</span><span>  ever,  the  applicant  must  not  rest  satisfied</span><span>  that  he  mil  be  duly  enrolled  as  an  elector.</span><span>  He  should  either  personally  or  by  deputy</span><span>  examine  the  preliminary  list  hung  up  at</span><span>  the  Police  Office  for  public  inspection</span><span>  during  the  first  fortnight  in  July,  and  if</span><span>  his  name  be  omitted,  at  once  lodge  a</span><span>  complaint  in  writing  with  the  Clerk  of</span><span>  Petty  Sessions.  And  further,  to  prevent</span><span>  mistake,  the  elector  should,  if  possible,</span><span>  appear  either  personally  or  by  attorney  at</span></p> <p><span>  thc  revision  court  held  under  the  statute</span></p> <p><span>  during  the  month  of  August.  As  is  well</span><span>  known,  some  of  the  revision  courts  held</span><span>  last  year  were  very  incredulous,  for  not</span><span>  even  a  solemn  declaration,  with  its</span><span>  correctness  certified  lo  by  a  magistrate,</span><span>  was  lield  tobeasalisfactory  proof  of  claim,</span><span>  in  the  absence  of  vivó,  voce  testimony.</span><span>  The  slightest  default  in  supplying  ""  dates,</span><span>  places,  areas,  and  values,""  was  held  to</span><span>  vitiate  the  application,  and  by  at  least</span></p> <p><span>  one  revision  court  the  Act  was  so  mis-</span><span>  interpreted  that  thc  personal  attendance</span><span>  of  the  applicant  was  in  all  cases  insisted</span><span>  upon.  H  was  under  such  ruling  that  the</span><span>  applications  of  some  twenty-two  residents</span><span>  of  Cowarral  were  rejected  by  the  St</span><span>  lawrence  revision  court;  and  even  in</span><span>  Rockhampton,  under  the  presidency  of</span><span>  a  District  Court  judge,  thc  slightest</span><span>  omission  of  date,  place,  area,  or  value,  was</span><span>  i  held  fatal  to  the  application,  unless  the</span></p> <p><span>  defect  »vere  made  good  to  the  satisfaction</span><span>  of  the  Court  by  oral  sworn  testimony.</span></p> <p><span>  It  may  be  hoped  that  Mr.  MACALISTER,  j</span><span>  profiling  by  thc  experience  of  last  year,</span></p> <p><span>  will  endeavour  to  prevent  such  hair-  J</span><span>  splitting  on  the  next  occasion.  The  !</span><span>  intention  of  thc  statute  clearly  is  that</span></p> <p><span>  thc  application,  strengthened  by  a  i</span><span>  solemn  declaration  certified  to  by  a</span><span>  justice  of  the  peace,  should  be,  units»</span><span>  objected  to,  satisfactory  proof  of  claim.</span><span>  The  Act  states  that  ""thc  declaration</span><span>  ""  attached  to  any  notice  of  claim  shall</span><span>  ""  be  taken  as  prima  facie  evidence</span><span>  of  thc  qualification  claimed.""  So</span><span>  (ar,  thcefore,  the  Act  is  man-</span><span>  datory,  and  surely  the  court,  having</span><span>  such  evidence  before  it,  cannot</span><span>  also  reasonably  demand  oral  sworn</span><span>  testimony,  except  perhaps  in  cases  where</span><span>  there  is  some  reasonable  doubt  as  to  the</span><span>  bona'fules  of  the  applicant.</span></p> <p><span>  It  may  here  be  well  to  caution  appli-</span></p> <p><span>  cants  that  much  more  care  and  cxacthess</span></p> <p><span>  is  requisite  in  claiming  under  a  property</span><span>  qualification,  than  under  the  ""  six</span><span>  months'  residence.""  It  has  been  held,</span><span>  for  example,  that  in  claiming  under  a</span><span>  leasehold,  thc  date  and  duration  of  thc</span><span>  lease  must  be  particularly  staled;  and  ¡tis</span><span>  not  sufficient  to  describo  thc  property</span><span>  merely  foridentificalion.  Theprecisearea,</span><span>  it  would  appear,  may  and  has  been  insisted</span><span>  upon  ;  and  it  may  be  presumed  that</span><span>  without  the  saving  words  ""more  or  less,""</span><span>  the  most  exact  applicant  in  this  respect</span><span>  may  find  himself  disfranchised.  Jt  is</span><span>  nothing  to  aver  thal  the  statute  never</span></p> <p><span>  intended  such  technical  exactness.  A</span></p> <p><span>  judge  by  habit  is</span></p> <p><span>  »  *  »  a  great  critic</span></p> <p><span>  Profoundly  skilled  in  analytic  ;</span><span>  He  can  distinguish  alni  divide</span></p> <p><span>  A  hair  'twixt  smith  ami  south-west</span></p> <p><span>  side.""</span></p> <p><span>  And  his  decision  in  the  revision  court</span></p> <p><span>  must,  so  far  as  the  applicant  is  concerned,</span><span>  bc  accepted  as  final.  In  the  interpreta-</span><span>  tion  of  a  statute  the  united  grasp  of  half-a</span><span>  dozen  non-legal  minds  does  not  weigh  a</span><span>  hair  against  the  dictum  of  onctraincd  one.</span><span>  Hence  a  whole  posse  of  magistrates,</span><span>  sitting  in  a  revision  court  with  ""  His</span><span>  Honor,""  have  practically  no  higher</span><span>  functions  than  to  give  local  information</span><span>  .and  twiddle  their  thumbs.  Under  these</span><span>  circumstances,  the  applicant  is  recom-</span><span>  mended  to  seek  enrollment,  whenever</span><span>  practicable,  under  the  residential  qualifi-</span><span>  cation,  as  the  simplest  and  most  certain</span><span>  method  of  attaining  the  status  of  an</span><span>  elector  of  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  extremely  doubtful  whether  the</span><span>  present  or  any  other  electoral  law  will</span><span>  work  satisfactorily  while  administered</span><span>  with  the  technical  exactness  of  a  legal</span><span>  tribunal.  The  claimant  under  a  property</span><span>  qualification,  for  example,  can  ordinarily</span><span>  only  ensure  success  by  either  giving  his</span><span>  personal  attendance,  or  incurring  the  ex-</span><span>  pense  of  employing  a  legal  gentleman  to</span><span>  prepare  his  application.  Not  one  lay-</span><span>  man  in  a  hundred  seems  competent  to</span><span>  carry  out  with  technical  strictness  this</span><span>  provision  in  the  Election  Act,  and  few</span><span>  persons  so  value  the  suffrage  as  to  wil-</span><span>  lingly  pay  a  legal  fee  for  the  privilege.</span><span>  If,  then,  we  would  have  all  impediments</span><span>  to  registration  removed,  it  will  perhaps</span><span>  be  wise  lo  adopt  the  language  put  by</span></p> <p><span>  SnAKiiSPKKi;  into  the  mouth  of  one  of</span><span>  his  characters</span></p> <p><span>  ""Thc  first  thing  we  &lt;lo,  let's  kill  all  thc</span><span>  lawyers  ""</span></p> <p><span>  metaphorically,  of  course.  In  other</span><span>  words,  let  legal  strictness  and  formality  be</span><span>  dispensed  with.  Let  the  revision  court  bc</span><span>  recommended  to  be  satisfied  with  reason-</span><span>  able  proof,  and  not  absolute  proof,  that</span><span>  applicants  possess  the  qualifications</span><span>  under  which  they  claim.  Were  such  a</span><span>  course  adopted,  we  should  hear  no  more</span><span>  of  the  complaint  that  the  Elections  Act</span><span>  of  1872  is  a  disfranchising  statute.  We</span><span>  believe  thc  grievance  under  notice  might</span><span>  be  easily  remedied,  by  the  Government.</span><span>  Were  a  circular  letter  addressed  by  the</span></p> <p><span>  COLONIAL  SI-XRKTAUV  to  thc  various</span><span>  benches  of  magistrates,  pointing  out  thal</span><span>  (he  design  of  the  Legislature  in  requiring</span><span>  the  declaration  before  a  magistrate  was</span><span>  to  obviate  the  necessity  of  personal</span><span>  attendance,  we  believe  the  direction</span><span>  would  be  hailed  as  an  opportune  relief</span><span>  from  embarrassment  at  the  ensuing</span><span>  revision  courts.  Otherwise,  in  the  face</span><span>  of  a  judge's  decision,  magistrates  can</span><span>  hardly  be  expected  lo  give  that  liberal</span><span>  interpretation  to  the  law  which  the</span><span>  legislature  certainly  intended  it  to  bear.</span></p> <p><span>  There  are  other  defects  in  the  present</span><span>  electoral  law,  but  most  of  them  might</span><span>  be  remedied  without  fresh  legislation,</span><span>  livery  clerk  of  petty  sessions,  for</span><span>  instance,  might  be  required  to  give  or</span><span>  send  by  post  a  receipt  for  each  applica-</span><span>  tion,  which  receipt  should  empower  a</span><span>  revision  court  to  add  thc  omitted  name</span><span>  to  the  electoral  roll.

On  Thurs-</span><span>  day  evening  when  the  Rockhampton</span><span>  .  Jockey  Club  committee  finally  deter-</span></p> <p><span>  mined  that  the  races  should  conic  off  as</span></p> <p><span>  advertised,  almost  everyone,  saving  the</span></p> <p><span>  owners  of  certain  horses,  regretted  the  ;</span><span>  necessity.  It  was  clearly  apparent  that</span><span>  even  if  the  rain  ceased  immediately</span><span>  after  the  meeting,  the  racecourse  must</span><span>  be  quite  in  an  unfit  state  for  running</span><span>  upon,  and  that,  barring  accidents,  thc</span><span>  strongest  and  not  the  fleetest  horses</span></p> <p><span>  must  win.  Dut  it  was  not  a  matter  in</span><span>  which  ardent  sportsmen  alone  seemed</span><span>  doomed  to  disappointment.  The  public,</span></p> <p><span>  who  subscribe  to  the  funds  of  the  |</span><span>  Jockey  Club,  and  who  look  forward</span></p> <p><span>  to  the  race  time  as  a  general  i</span><span>  holiday,  would  have  found  no  enjoy-  ¡</span><span>  ment  in  seeing  horses  canter  through  &lt;</span><span>  a  sea  of  mud,  while  the  course  generally,  \</span><span>  and  the  vicinity  of  the  stand  and  booths</span></p> <p><span>  particularly,  were  a  complete  bog.  Mode-  '</span><span>  rately  fmc  weather  and  a  sound  turf  are  &lt;</span><span>  essential  to  the  enjoyment  of  race  days  ?</span><span>  by  the  general  public,  for  in  truth  the  ?</span><span>  majority  of  visitors  go  to  see  the  happy  i</span></p> <p><span>  and  well-dressed  crowd  rather  than  to  !</span></p> <p><span>  witness  the  triumphs  of  horses  and  '</span><span>  jockeys.  The  races  supply  an  object  '</span><span>  and  pretext  for  a  day's  outing  at  the</span><span>  time  of  year  when  thc  weather  is  usually</span></p> <p><span>  all  that  could  be  desired.  To  the  ,</span><span>  majority,  however  auspicious  the  sun</span><span>  might  have  shone  out  yesterday,  the</span><span>  condition  or  the  ground  was  such</span><span>  as  to  preclude  all  hope  of  pleasure,</span></p> <p><span>  cither  at  the  racecourse  or  on  picnic  \</span><span>  excursions  elsewhere.  While,  there-  ,</span><span>  fore,  the  decision  of  the  Stewards  ]</span><span>  was  accepted  as  in  conformity  with  law,  ,</span><span>  it  was  felt  to  bc  an  unfortunate  necessity  ,</span><span>  that  the  races  could  not  be  postponed.  ¡</span><span>  So  that,  when  the  flood  rains  set  in  &lt;</span><span>  yesterday  morning,  and  rendered  thc  ?</span><span>  .  carrying  out  of  the  programme  a  physical  :</span></p> <p><span>  impossibility,  most  people  felt  that  all  ¡</span><span>  was  for  the  best.  Thc  gloominess  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  .weather,  and  the  steady  deluging  rain,  ¡</span><span>  were  depressing,  no  doubt,  but  such  a</span></p> <p><span>  state  of  affairs  was  better  than  a  Scotch  '</span><span>  mist,  or  even  than  occasional  heavy  '</span><span>  showers.  The  Stewards,  with  their  usual  1</span><span>  good  judgment,  took  care  that  no  exeep-  '</span><span>  lion  should  reasonably  bc  taken  to  their</span></p> <p><span>  proceedings,  and  a  quorum  was  told  off  1</span><span>  lo  bc  in  attendance  at  the  grand  stand  al  '</span><span>  the  advertised  hour,  and  start  any  horses</span><span>  thal  might  put  in  an  appearance.  The</span></p> <p><span>  precaution  was  wise,  bul  the  pouring  rain,  '</span><span>  as  it  turned  out,  made  allendince  quite  j</span><span>  unnecessary.  Al  lim  appointed  hour  the  .</span><span>  Stewards  were  punctually  at  their  post,  r</span><span>  but  ¡¡ot  a  single  racehorse  pul  in  an  ;.</span><span>  appearance,  and  therefore  all  chance  of  j</span><span>  litigation  in  consequence  of  postpone-  t</span><span>  mein  was  quite  swept  away.  The  down-  ,</span><span>  pour  was  too  heavy  even  fur  those  v</span></p> <p><span>  owners  who,  having  powerful  nags,</span><span>  believed  they  could  win  the  slakes</span><span>  through  a  mile  or  two  of  bog,  and,  as</span><span>  already  stated,  the  very  awkward  problem</span><span>  as  to  thcÄcpedicncy  of  a  postponement</span><span>  has  Jv>  satisfactorily  solved  without</span><span>  the  aow>f  resolutions  and  lawyers.</span></p> <p><span>  The  proceedings  of  the  Committee  at</span><span>  their  subsequent  meeting  ought  to  give</span><span>  universal  satisfaction.  They  postponed</span><span>  the  races  until  Wednesday  and  Thursday</span><span>  next,  by  which  time,  it  may  be  hoped,</span><span>  the  heavens  will  have  given  forth  their</span><span>  superfluous  fatness,  and  the  waters</span><span>  receded  from  this  part  of  the  earth.</span><span>  The  resolution,  too,  which  provides  that</span><span>  I  ages,  weights,  and  entries  shall  stand  as</span></p> <p><span>  already  determined  upon,  cannot  be</span><span>  objected  to.  Indeed,  it  is  the  only</span><span>  j  possible  arrangement  without  inflicting</span><span>  I  great  injustice.  Whether  it  is  in  strict</span></p> <p><span>  accordance  with  racing  law  or  not,  we</span><span>  arc  unable  to  determine,  but  it  is</span><span>  certainly  in  strict  accordance  with  equity.</span><span>  The  cause  of  postponement  was  wholly</span><span>  beyond  human  control,  and  owners  of</span><span>  horses  ought  not  to  suffer  penalties  in</span><span>  consequence.  The  choice  of  the</span><span>  Alexandra  Park  course,  too,  is  wise.</span><span>  Tlie  club's  own  course  will  be  in  a  worse</span><span>  condition  for  running  next  Wednesday</span><span>  than  it  is  to-day,  and  unless</span><span>  the  Committee  had  agreed  to  a</span><span>  postponement  of  at  least  a  fort-</span><span>  night,  the  races,  if  on  their  own</span><span>  course,  would  not  have  been  a  success.</span><span>  Alexandra  l'ark,  however,  being  near  the</span><span>  river  bank,  and  naturally  well  drained,</span><span>  will  probably  be  in  fair  condition</span><span>  within  a  week,  and  it  is  obviously  for  the</span><span>  interest  of  all  concerned  to  make  the</span><span>  postponement  as  brief  as  possible.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  whole,  there  is  reason  to  hope</span><span>  that  the  meeting  will,  after  all,  be  a</span><span>  success,  and  that  thc  non-racing  public</span><span>  -a  not  insignificant  minority-will  be</span><span>  afforded  the  opportunity  of  spending  a</span><span>  pleasant  two  days'  holiday  under  a  bright</span><span>  sky,  and  in  such  manner  as  they  may</span><span>  think  most  agreeable.  The  greatest</span><span>  sufferers  will  be  our  visitors,  especially</span><span>  those  who  have  brought  horses  from</span><span>  distant  places,  and  have  other  engage-</span><span>  ments-to  fulfil.

O.  HERBERT,  Commis-</span><span>  sioner  for  Railways,  dated  9th  April,</span><span>  1874,  to  Mr.  STANLEY,  informing  him</span><span>  by  desire  of  the  Secretary  for  Public</span><span>  Works,  that  he  (Mr.  STANLEY)  had  been</span><span>  suspended  from  the  position  of  Chief</span><span>  Engineer  of  the  Southern  and  Western</span><span>  Railway,  pending  the  decision  of  the</span><span>  Government  as  to  his  competency.  In</span><span>  another  letter  of  same  date,  Mr.  J.</span><span>  ?THORNLOE  SMITH,  is  addressed  as  Act-</span><span>  ing  Chief  Engineer,  and  requested  to  take</span><span>  charge  of  die  department  On  the</span><span>  following  day  Mr.  STANLEY  writes  to  the</span><span>  head  of  his  department  expressing  sur-</span><span>  prise,  as  during  a  period  of  eight  years</span><span>  that  he  had  been  connected  with  the</span><span>  railway,  he  had  never  incurred  censure</span><span>  or  blame  on  any  occasion.  He  also</span><span>  requests  to  be  be  informed  of  the  specific</span><span>  grounds  upon  which  the  charge  of  in-</span><span>  competency  is  based,  in  order  that  an</span><span>  opportunity  of  self-defence  may  be</span><span>  afforded.  On  the  21st,  Mr.  STANLEY</span><span>  again  wiles,  reminding  the  COMMIS-</span><span>  SIONER  FOR  RAILWAYS  that  no  reply  had</span><span>  been  received  to  his  letter  of  the  10th</span><span>  instant,  pointing  out  that  the  fact  of  sus-</span><span>  pension  is  likely  to  do  him  very  serious</span><span>  injury  in  his  profession  as  an  engineer,</span><span>  and  urging  that  an  early  reply  may  be</span><span>  accorded.  This  elicits  a  reply  on  the</span><span>  27th  April,  inviting  Mr.  STANLEY'S</span><span>  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  letter  of  the</span><span>  9th  instant  does  not  charge  him  with</span><span>  incompetency  but  intimates  that  his</span><span>  competence  as  Chief  Engineer  was</span><span>  questioned  by  the  Government  upon  the</span><span>  following  grounds  :</span></p> <p><span>  Firstly.-That  in  such  capacity  you  lcd  thc</span><span>  Government  to  believe  that  a  line  of  railwav</span></p> <p><span>  could  bo  constructed  from  Brisbane  to  Ipsnicl</span><span>  for  thc  sum  of  £8000  per  mile,  which  bj</span><span>  estimates  (BO  called)  subsequently  prepared  bj</span><span>  you,  is  computed  to  cost  £319,000.</span></p> <p><span>  Secondly.-That  although  you  did  no1</span><span>  probably  suggest  the  system  of  small  contracts</span><span>  still  it  was  under  your  advice  and  approva</span><span>  that  the  Government  had  evidently  acted  ii</span><span>  carrying  ont  these  works-a  system  which</span><span>  except  under  very  extraordinary  am</span><span>  exceptional  circumstances,  must  bc  vcr]</span><span>  expensive  in  the  hands  of  the  (Joven!</span><span>  ment,  as,  in  fact,  it  bas  actually  proved  in  thi</span></p> <p><span>  present  case.</span></p> <p><span>  Thirdly.-That  having  advised  the  Govern</span><span>  ment  to  carry  on  thc  works  by  this  systen</span><span>  of  email  contracts,  you,  in  tho  actual  carryin]</span><span>  out  of  such  system,  have  departed  from  you</span><span>  own  propositions  and  the  instructions  of  th</span><span>  Government  in  such  a  way  as  to  destroy  in  1</span><span>  groat  degree  thc  check  thc  Government  migli</span><span>  have  had  upon  tho  cost  of  the  works,  and  th</span><span>  proper  expenditure  of  public  money  provide</span></p> <p><span>  for  the  same.</span></p> <p><span>  To  this  letter  Mr.  STANLEY  replies  01</span><span>  the  29th  of  April,  averring  that  m</span><span>  estimate  was  ever  prepared  or  furnishei</span><span>  by  him  showing  thc  probable  cost  of  th</span><span>  whole  line  at  £8ooo  per  mile,  an*</span><span>  denying  that  he  ever  led  the  Goverr</span><span>  ment  to  suppose  that  it  could  b</span><span>  constructed  for  that  sum.  He  also  add</span><span>  that  when  the  original  loan  vot</span><span>  of  £192,000  was  passed,  no  estimât</span><span>  whatever  of  the  total  cost  of  the  line  ha</span><span>  been  furnished  by  him,  and  gives  detail</span><span>  ;  of  his  first  estimate,  submitted  som</span><span>  months  subsequently,  showing  thc  tot:</span><span>  I  cost  of  thc  line,  including  i>35,y73  fi</span><span>  i  thc  Ipswich  deviation,  would  t</span></p> <p><span>  £286,875  X4S.  nd.  To  which  he  adds</span><span>  £32J54I  for  widening  the  Oxley  Bridge,</span><span>  and  for  extra  cost  of  steel  rails,  bringing</span><span>  :  the  total  estimate  up  to  £319,417.  But</span><span>  a  further  increase  became  apparent  after-</span><span>  wards  on  the  detailed  estimates,  in</span><span>  consequence  of  the  advance  in  iron  and</span><span>  labour,  bringing  up  the  grand  total  to</span><span>  £349,000.  Mr.  STANLEY  continues  to</span><span>  point  out  that  the  system  of  small</span><span>  contracts  having  been  adopted  by  the</span><span>  Government,  it  became  his  duty  to  carry</span><span>  out  their  views  in  the  best  way  to  make</span><span>  the  system  efficient  He  declares</span><span>  that  tlie  works  carried  out  by  him  will</span></p> <p><span>  bear  favourable  comparison,  both  as  to  j</span><span>  character  and  cost,  with  similar  works</span><span>  hitherto  executed  on  any  of  Ute  Queens-</span><span>  land  railways.  And  he  concludes  by</span><span>  hoping  that,  under  the  circumstances,</span><span>  the  SECRETARY  FOR  PUBLIC  WORKS  will</span><span>  be  pleased  to  take  such  steps  as  may</span><span>  remove  any  stigma  which  the  suspension</span><span>  may  attach  to  his  professional  reputation</span><span>  as  an  engineer.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  5th  May,  Mr.  HERBERT,  in</span><span>  reply,  addresses  a  letter,  directing  Mr.</span><span>  STANLEY'S  attention  to  his  report  of  15th</span><span>  March,  1873,  in  which  the  estimated</span><span>  cost  of  a  portion  of  the  line  is  shown  at</span><span>  ""  at  £7796  lös.  per  mile,  including</span><span>  ""  works,  permanent  way,  materials,</span><span>  ""  and  maintenance  for  twelve  months,</span><span>  ""  but  not  engineering  superintendence</span><span>  ""  or  purchase  of  land.""  Mr.  HERBERT</span><span>  next  refers  to  the  following  passage  in</span><span>  the  same  report  :-""  I  must,  however,</span><span>  ""  point  out  that  this  is  hardly  a  fair</span><span>  i  ""  criterion  of  the  probable  average  cost</span></p> <p><span>  f  ""  per  mile  of  the  line,  as  this  section</span></p> <p><span>  ""  embraces  universally  heavy  bridge</span><span>  ""  works,  including  two  large  viaducts</span><span>  ""  over  the  Bundanba  and  Six-mile</span><span>  ""  Creeks.""  He  then  goes  on  to  say</span><span>  that  the  MINISTER  FOR  PUBLIC  WORKS</span></p> <p><span>  presumes  the  late  Government  acted</span><span>  upon  some  professional  advice  in  esti-</span><span>  mating  the  cost  of  the  line  at  £8000</span><span>  per  mile  in  the  Loan  Estimates  before</span><span>  Parliament  in  July,  1872,  and  it  was</span><span>  improbable  that  in  seeking  such  advice</span><span>  they  would  pass  over  their  Chief</span><span>  Engineer.  Another  point  adverted  to  by</span><span>  Mr.  HERBERT  in  this  letter  is  that  Mr.</span><span>  STANLEY  was  instructed  by  the  late  Go-</span><span>  vernment  to  prepare  and  submit  detailed</span><span>  estimates  showing  the  cost  of  the  works</span><span>  on  the  several  sections  before  such  works</span><span>  were  gone  on  with.  This,  he  says,  was,</span><span>  in  fact,  the  basis  of  the  small  contract</span><span>  system,  and  the  only  check  which  the</span><span>  I  Government  had  on  the  Chief  Engineer,</span></p> <p><span>  j  But  this  was  not  done.  In  conclusion</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  HERBERT  says  :</span></p> <p><span>  I  am  further  to  observo  that  tho  Secretary  for</span><span>  Public  Works  has  no  intention  of  casting  any</span><span>  stigma  upon  your  professional  reputation,  so</span><span>  far  as  thc  designs  of  the  work  on  the  Brisbane</span><span>  Railway  arc  concerned  :  on  thc  contraray,  he</span><span>  has  plcasuro  in  expressing  again  his  cordial</span><span>  approval  with  respect  thereto.</span></p> <p><span>  Finally,  I  am  to  add  that  tho  Secretary  for</span><span>  Public  Works  regrets  that  your  identification</span><span>  with  the  present  system  of  workiug  has  loft  him</span><span>  no  other  course  than  to  complete  the  works  in</span><span>  progress  through  other  hands.</span></p> <p><span>  Two  days  afterwards  -  Mr.  STANLEY</span><span>  writes  a  long  letter  in  self-justification,  in</span><span>  which,  we  think,  he  but  partially  succeds.</span><span>  In  concluding  he  expresses  the  hope</span><span>  ""  that,  under  the  circumstances,  the</span><span>  ""  Government  may  be  pleased  to  take</span><span>  ""  into  favourable  consideration  my  being</span><span>  ""  placed  in  such  other  appointment  as</span><span>  ""  they  may  be  willing  to  transfer  me  to.""</span><span>  The  correspondence  concludes  with  a</span><span>  letter  to  Mr.  STANLEY,  informing  him</span><span>  that  the  Government  have  been  pleased</span><span>  to  transfer  him  to  the  position  of</span><span>  ""  Engineer  in  charge  of  Railway  Surveys,</span><span>  ""  at  a  salary  of  £600  per  annnm.""</span></p> <p><span>  In  this  manner,  Mr.  STANLEY'S  grounds</span><span>  for  complaint  are  removed,  and  the  im-</span><span>  pression  is  that,  although  a  good  engi-</span><span>  neer,  his  estimates  are  scarcely  trust-</span><span>  worthy,  and  his  practical  superintendence</span><span>  is  inefficient.  He  is  believed  to  be  no</span><span>  match  lor  the  small  and  swindling  con-</span><span>  tractors  who  are  the  bane  of  the  system</span><span>  under  which  our  railways  are  carried  out.</span><span>  And,  as  he  -has  obtained  another  appoint-</span><span>  ment  at  the  salary  of  £600  a</span><span>  year,  his  case  is  not  one  over  which</span><span>  much  sympathy  will  be  thrown  away.</span><span>  With  regard  to  the  interests  of  the  public,</span><span>  however,  there  is  small  room  for  con-</span><span>  gratulation.  Instead  of  £349,000,  Mr.</span><span>  STANLEY'S  latest  estimate,  the  Legislature</span><span>  are  now  asked  to  provide  an  additional</span><span>  £205,000,  bringing  the  total  cost  of  the</span><span>  twenty-four  miles  of  line  up  to</span><span>  £397,000.  And  even  this,  be  it  re-</span><span>  membered,  is  only  an  estimate,  as  the</span><span>  line  will  not  be  finished  for  nearly  two</span><span>  years,  and  there  will  be  abundance  of</span><span>  time  for  a  still  further  multipli-</span><span>  cation  of  figures.  Still,  as  the  bulk  of</span><span>  the  work  is  now  done,  and  the  chief  of</span><span>  the  remaining  outlay  will  be  upon  im-</span><span>  ported  goods,  and  the  bridge  over  the</span><span>  river  at  Oxley,  it  may  be  hoped  that  the</span><span>  ultimate  cost  of  the  work  will  not  exceed</span><span>  £400,000,  or  at  the  rate  of  £16,666  per</span><span>  mile!  We  were  under  the  impression</span><span>  that  Mr.  FITZGERALD  had  taught  us  a</span><span>  lesson  in  railway  construction,  but  later</span><span>  experience  teaches  that  our  public  men</span><span>  have  still  something  to  learn  in  that</span><span>  department  of  knowledge.</span></p> <p><span>  MAILS  per  s.

The  Edu-</span></p> <p><span>  cational  Board  have  heretofore  been</span><span>  entrusted  with  the  uncontrolled  expendi-</span><span>  ture  of  the  large  sums  animally  voted  for</span><span>  educational  purposes  ;  at  the  same  time</span><span>  there  is  much  well  grounded  dissatis-</span><span>  faction  with  tlie  proceedings  of  the</span><span>  Board,  indications  not  having  been</span><span>  wanting  that,  like  all  other  irresponsible</span><span>  bodies,  it  is  wont  to  be  partial  and</span><span>  despotic  in  administration.  The  imme-</span><span>  diate  cause  of  Mr.  MACROSSAN'*  taking</span><span>  action  was  the  refusal  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Board  to  entertain  a  petition  from</span><span>  teachers  praying  for  an  advance  of  salary</span><span>  because  the  signatures  were  nearly  all  in</span><span>  the  same  handwriting.  And  when  the</span><span>  written  authorisations  to  attach  the  sig-</span><span>  natures  were  handed  in,  the  petitioners</span><span>  found  themselves  in  no  better  position.</span><span>  This  was  extremely  arbitrary  on  the  part</span><span>  of  the  Board,  who  well  knew  that  it</span><span>  would  be  almost  impossible  to  obtain</span><span>  the  signatures  of  teachers  in  all  parts  of</span><span>  the  colony  to  the  same  document.  The</span></p> <p><span>  demand  that  detailed  estimates  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  educational  department  should  be  laid</span><span>  before  the  House  is  a  reasonable  one,  and</span><span>  it  is  satisfactory  to  leam  that  on  all  future</span><span>  occasions  the  particulars  will  be  supplied.</span><span>  Mr.  MACROSSAN,  however,  in  the  course</span><span>  of  his  speech  displayed  an  ill-concealed</span><span>  objection  to  governmental  control  of  the</span><span>  schools,  and  complained  of  the  unduly</span><span>  large  number  of  inspectors  appointed,  as</span><span>  compared  with  the  total  number  of</span><span>  schools  in  existence.  But  inspection  is</span><span>  a  vital  part  of  the  system  of  State  educa-</span><span>  tion,  for  without  it  aggressive  sectarians</span></p> <p><span>  will  manage  to  smuggle  in  dogmatic  |</span><span>  teaching  on  religious  subjects  for  which</span><span>  the  Government  very  properly  refuses  to</span><span>  pay.  It  is  supposed  by  some  persons</span><span>  that  the  action  just  taken  in  the  House</span><span>  is  in  connection  with  some  plan,  yet  in</span><span>  embryo,  for  deluding  the  public  into  the</span><span>  belief  that  non-vested  schools  are  an</span></p> <p><span>  essential  part  of  our  educational  system.1</span><span>  But  this  we  think  an  error,  for  if</span><span>  anything  is  calculated  to  seal  the  doom</span><span>  of  sectarian  schools,  the  dissemination  of1</span><span>  information  respecting  them  may  be</span><span>  supposed  to  have  that  effect.  In  a  few</span><span>  days  the  second  reading  of  Mr.  GRIFFITH'S</span><span>  bill  will  come  on,  and  we  shall  then  see</span><span>  honorable  members  display  their  true</span><span>  colours.  At  present  it  is  scarcely  possible</span><span>  to  distinguish  nationalists  from  denomi</span><span>  nationalists,  but  Mr.  GRIFFITH'S  bill</span><span>  raises  an  issue  which  cannot  be</span><span>  evaded.  It  is  said  that  several  secret</span><span>  denominationalists  refuse  to  vote  for  the</span><span>  bill  because  it  is  not  a  Government</span><span>  measure.  But  these  wolves  in  sheep's</span><span>  clothing-if  there  be  such  in  the  present</span><span>  :  House-well  know  that  thc  religious</span></p> <p><span>  '  element,  introduced  into  our  educational</span></p> <p><span>  system  by  an  evasion  of  our  statule  law,</span><span>  is  the  true  obstacle  to  any  government</span><span>  dealing  with  the  education  question  as  a</span><span>  matter  of  public  policy.  It  may  be</span><span>  hoped  that,  despite  the  extreme  diffi-</span><span>  culty  of  a  private  member  forcing  any</span><span>  measure  through  the  House,  the  advo-</span><span>  cates  of  National  Education  will  rally</span><span>  boldly  and  patriotically  round  Mr.</span><span>  GRIFFITH,  and  insist  on  his  measure</span><span>  becoming  law  before  the  session  closes.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  revenue  collectai  at  thc  Custom  House</span><span>  from  the  let  to  thc  30th  April  inclusive,</span></p> <p><span>  amounts  to  £Ô5!K)  13a.  2s.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  dray  approach  to  the  Railway  Wharf</span><span>  from  Quay-street  at  the  foot  of  Stanley-street,</span><span>  is  sadly  in  want  net  so  much  of  repair  as  of</span><span>  alteration.

Il</span><span>  must  be  observed,  however,  that  the  bill</span><span>  now  before  thc  Assembly  is  not  com-</span><span>  pulsory  in  this  respect.

Their  ordinary  hours,  we</span><span>  j  understand,  are  from  «S.30  a.m.  to</span><span>  1  o  p.m.,  lo  which  there  is  mu</span></p> <p><span>  j  much  objection,  but  when  a  pressure  ol</span></p> <p><span>  I  business  occurs-which  in  some  esta</span></p> <p><span>  I  blisluneiits  is  almost  the  normal  condition</span></p> <p><span>  oí  a/Tairs-these  young  girls  (the  future</span><span>  wives  and  mothers  of  the  colony)  arc</span><span>  kept  at  work  till  midnight  or  later,  and</span><span>  dieu  turned  out  upon  the  streets  to  go</span><span>  to  their  homes.  This  practice  is  very</span><span>  objectionable  in  two  ways:  long  hours</span><span>  al  the  sewing  machine  or  other  seden-</span><span>  tary  employment  cannot  fail  to  be  very</span><span>  injurious,  physically,  to  girls  at  a  critical</span><span>  period  of  life,  and  may  be  expected  to</span><span>  sow  the  seeds  of  future  sickness,  if  not</span><span>  premature  death  ;-thc  sending  of  young</span><span>  girls  into  the  streets  at  late  hours  can</span><span>  hardly  fail  also  to  be  morally  injurious,</span></p> <p><span>  and  is  known  to  be  the  cause  of  much</span><span>  prostitution  in  lirisbaiie  and  thc  other</span><span>  metropolitan  cities  of  Australia.  Thc  rage</span><span>  amongst  )'Oung  girls  for  employment  in</span><span>  factories  is  becoming  a  very  serious</span><span>  matter.  Domestic  service  is  not  to  be</span><span>  thought  of  while  from  fifteen  to  twenty</span><span>  five  shillings  per  week  can  bc  earned  at</span><span>  the  sewing  machine,  and  hence  house-</span><span>  wives  arc  in  despair  at  the  impossibility</span><span>  of  procuring  help  in  their  domestic</span><span>  duties.  Thc  claims  of  liberty  and  in-</span><span>  dependence  attach  to  the  life  of  the</span><span>  factory  girl,  and  the  night-work,  in  too</span><span>  many  cases  where  there  is  no  positive</span><span>  vice,  alfords  an  excuse  for  an  hour  or</span><span>  two's  promenade  with  ""thc  boys,""which</span><span>  leads  too  often  to  the  worst  results.  Tile</span><span>  same  remarks  apply  in  many  respects  to</span><span>  young  girls,  whose  constitutions  are  often</span><span>  permanently  injured  by  the  practice  of</span><span>  turning  day  -nto  night,  and  the  irregular</span><span>  habits  which  it  too  often  induces.</span></p> <p><span>  The  prohibition  against  the  employ-</span><span>  ment  of  children  during  school  hours  and</span><span>  at  night  is,  we  think,  very  desirable.</span><span>  Hoys  in  these  limes  receive  such  wages</span><span>  that  many  parents  are  quite  willing  lo</span><span>  take  them  from  school  at  eight  or  nine</span><span>  years  of  age,  and  send  them  to  ""carn</span><span>  their  living.""

The</span></p> <p><span>  tenor  of  Mr.  MACU.I.NIT.K'.S  remarks  on</span></p> <p><span>  this  subject,  last  week,  seemed  to  imply</span><span>  thal  tho  complete  abolition  of  the  dillies</span><span>  was  not  contemplated.  ll  will  be</span><span>  observed  thai  there  is  no  mention  of  a</span><span>  loan,  and  Mr.  M'IIAVKAII  n's  intention</span><span>  to  ask  for  a  vote  u(£i  20,000  to  complete</span><span>  the  Northern  Kail  way  to  the  Daivson</span><span>  has  evidently  bei«  abandoned  for  the</span><span>  Session.  Reviewing  the  information  to</span><span>  hand  respecting  the  Kslimiles,  we  are</span><span>  forced  to  the  conclusion  that  in  the  Works</span></p> <p><span>  Department  they  are  most  unsatisfactory</span><span>  lo  this  part  of  the  colony,  especially  in</span><span>  the  division  of  the  surplus.  The  few</span><span>  sums  set  down  in  aid  of  our  local  insti-</span><span>  tutions  .ire  not  of  much  account  when  it</span><span>  is  considered  that  the  revenue  is  in  a</span></p> <p><span>  flourishing  condition,  and  large  sums  are</span><span>  to  be  spent  throughout  the  colony  in</span><span>  works  and  improvements.  The  improve-</span><span>  ment  of  the  Kilzroy  is  estimated  at  a</span><span>  value  of  one  to  thirteen  as  compared</span><span>  to  that  of  Moleton  Hay,  and  wc  have  to</span><span>  complain  not  only  of  the  smallness  of  thc</span><span>  amount  proposed  lo  be  expended,  bul  the</span><span>  absence  of  any  provision  for  a  compre-</span><span>  hensive  and  thorough  survey  of  the  river</span><span>  by  a  competent  engineer.  And  this,  we</span><span>  contend,  should  be  the  preliminary  step</span><span>  to  the  actual  work  of  deepening  the</span><span>  river.  There  is  no  reason  to  expect  that</span><span>  the  present  Ministry,  judging  from  their</span><span>  general  conduct,  will  find  it  convenient</span><span>  lo  push  on  our  railway  extension  with</span><span>  greater  rapidity  than  it  is  now  being</span><span>  done.

"<p><span>  The  Rockhampton  Bulletin,</span></p> <p><span>  WITH  WHICH  IS  INCORPORATED  THE</span></p> <p><span>  GLADSTONE  OBSERVER.</span></p> <p><span>  PUBLISHED  DAILY.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  JANUARY  24,  1874.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  news  of  the  wreck  of  the  A.S.N.</span><span>  Company's  steamship  James  Paterson,</span><span>  has  scarcely  taken  the  public  by  sur-</span></p> <p><span>  prise,  for  it  was  felt  that  any  vessel  at</span><span>  sea  within  range  of  the  terrific  gale</span><span>  which  lasted  through  Wednesday  night</span><span>  and  the  following  day,  must  of</span><span>  necessity  have  been  in  great  peril,  even</span><span>  in  open  water  with  plenty  of  room  to</span></p> <p><span>  tack  or  run  before  thc  storm.  But  the</span></p> <p><span>  apprehensions  of  danger  were  intensified</span><span>  by  the  knowledge  that  the  navigation</span></p> <p><span>  on  our  coast  is  restricted  to  a  channel</span><span>  averaging  for  some  distance  not  more</span><span>  than  twenty  miles  in  width.</span></p> <p><span>  The  James  Paterson,  s.s.,  left  Mary-</span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  borough  a  few  minutes  after  the  Leich-</span><span>  hardt,  on  Tuesday  morning  last,  and</span><span>  should  have  arrived  here  by  Wednes-</span><span>  day's  midday  tide.  The  time  required</span><span>  for  ordinary  steaming  from  wharf  to  wharf</span><span>  is  not  more  than  twenty  five  hours.  In</span><span>  order,  therefore,  to  account  for  her</span><span>  being  off  Masthead  leland  at  the  time</span><span>  when  the  disaster  occurred,  we  must</span><span>  assume  either  that  she  lost  two  tides</span><span>  before  clearing  the  Fairway  buoy,  or</span><span>  that  she  was  disabled  at  sea  and  unable</span><span>  to  maintain  her  ordinary  speed  before</span><span>  the  bad  weather  came  on.  It  is  satis-</span><span>  factory,  however,  that  no  lives  have  been</span><span>  lost.  The  life  boat,  which  reached  the</span><span>  pilot  station  last  night  would  not  have</span><span>  left  the  wreck  before  yesterday  morning,</span></p> <p><span>  as  the  distance  traversed  is  not  more</span></p> <p><span>  than  from  thirty  to  forty  miles.  Since</span><span>  yesterday  morning  the  weather  has</span><span>  continued  calm,  and  as  the  Leichhardt  will</span><span>  be  alongside  the  wreck  by  eight  o'clock</span><span>  this  norning,  it  is  tolerably  certain  that</span></p> <p><span>  the  crew  and  passengers  will  be  all</span><span>  taken  safely  off  without  difficulty.</span></p> <p><span>  Captain  BIRRELL  fears  for  the  safety  of</span><span>  the  ship  Landsborough.  She  weighed</span><span>  anchor  on  Wednesday  morning,  and</span></p> <p><span>  went  out  to  sea.  Towards  midnight</span><span>  the  wind  arose,  and  shortly  afterwards</span><span>  blew  in  gusts  of  great  violence.  There</span><span>  was  no  moon,  and  the  weather  was</span><span>  thick  and  dirty.  The  wind  was  ahead,</span><span>  and  we  hardly  think  the  ship  could  have</span><span>  beat  up  against  it.  From  the</span></p> <p><span>  waters  being  narrow,  and  currents</span><span>  strong,  she  could  neither  heave  to</span><span>  nor  run  before  the  wind  with</span></p> <p><span>  safety.  Taking  all  the  circumstances</span><span>  into  consideration,  it  is  not  easy  to</span><span>  imagine  how  she  could  have  managed  to</span><span>  ride  through  the  storm.  But  we  must</span><span>  hope  for  the  best,  not  only  for  the  sake</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  lives  and  property  at  stake,  but</span><span>  for  the  reputation  of  the  port.  Had</span><span>  there  been  a  coast  pilot  on  board,  he</span><span>  would  probably  have  brought  the  ship</span><span>  back  to  her  anchorage  under  Seaview</span><span>  Hill,  or  contrived  to  run  into  Port</span></p> <p><span>  Curtis  ;  but  Captain  THOMAS,  being  a</span></p> <p><span>  stranger  to  these  waters,  would  deem  it</span></p> <p><span>  his  most  prudent  course  to  keep  off  the</span></p> <p><span>  land  as  much  as  possible.  She  had  on</span><span>  board  464  tons  of  ballast,  and  not  250</span><span>  tons,  as  we  stated  yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Lord  Ashley,  steamer,  was  also  at</span><span>  sea  in  the  gale.  She  left  Rockhampton</span><span>  on  Tuesday  night,  but  lost  a  tide  in  the</span><span>  river,  and  did  not  leave  the  bay  until</span><span>  about  five  o'clock  on  Wednesday  even-</span><span>  ing.  It  is  asserted,  so  we  are  informed,</span><span>  by  Mr.  MITCHELL,  of  the  Dunmore</span><span>  Arms,  and  Mr.  BARTHOLOMEW,  of</span><span>  Sebastopol,  both  of  whom  were  at</span><span>  Emu  Park  on  Thursday,  that  they</span><span>  saw  the  Ashley  lying  under  the</span><span>  shelter  of  Keppel  Island.  It  is</span><span>  just  what  Captain  HARLEY  would  be</span><span>  likely  to  do  when  he  found  he  could  not</span><span>  proceed  with  safety,  and  we  hope  and</span><span>  believe  the  statement  is  true.  There  is</span></p> <p><span>  good  shelter  under  South  Keppel,  and  it</span><span>  is  therefore  pretty  certain  that  the</span><span>  Ashley,  with  her  crowd  of  passengers,</span><span>  has  suffered  no  damage,  and  is  now</span><span>  making  good  progress  on  her  way  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  Endeavour.</span></p> <p><span>  A  CORRESPONDENT  from  Emu  Park  states</span><span>  that  the  late  storm  began  there  a  little  before</span><span>  midnight  on  Wednesday  last,  and  raged  with</span><span>  great  fury  until  Thursday  night,  when  it</span><span>  moderated.

The  proceedings  were  entirely</span><span>  of  .1  preliminary  nature.  Thc  object  of</span><span>  the  meeting  is  one  that  must  enlist  tile</span><span>  sympathy  of  everyone  having  the  com-</span><span>  mercial  prosperity  of  thc  colony  at  heart.</span><span>  Thc  CHAIRMAN,  in  his  opening  address,</span><span>  referred  to  the  fact  that  the  carriage  of</span><span>  wool  from  Rockhampton  to  lîrisbane</span><span>  was  the  same  as  from  Rockhampton  lo</span><span>  Sydney,  and  the  same  remark  applied  to</span><span>  ]towen.  This  is  a  wrong  of  which</span><span>  the  mercantile  community  throughout</span><span>  Queensland  has  always  had  to  com-</span><span>  plain,  and  even  thc  A.  S.  N.  Com</span><span>  '  pany  themselves  must  admit  thal  il</span><span>  1  is  an  anomaly  which  cannot  he  easily</span></p> <p><span>  accounted  for  on  business  principles,  lt</span><span>  may  he  a  simple  and  convenient  arrange-</span><span>  ment  of  thc  Company's  tariff  for  the</span><span>  Company  itself,  but'it  operates  unequally</span><span>  and  unjustly  upon  the  transactions  of  the</span><span>  Company's  pattons.  In  all  business</span><span>  transactions  there  is  a  presumed  recipro-</span><span>  city  of  advantage.  Still  the  system  pur-</span><span>  sued  by  the  Company,  by  simplifying  its</span><span>  scale  of  charges,  and  bringing  all  its</span><span>  vessels  directly  and  completely  under</span><span>  (he  supervision  of  the  directors,  is,  we</span><span>  presume,  in  some  degree  conducive  to</span></p> <p><span>  lite  interests  of  the  shareholders,  lt  is</span><span>  really  very  important  to  tho  Company</span><span>  that  its  business  should,  as  far  as  possible</span><span>  radiate  from  its  central  point,  and</span><span>  that  point  being  Sydney,  il  becomes  a</span><span>  desirable  object  to  attract  to  Port  Jack-</span><span>  son  as  much  as  possible  of  Ihe  Austra-</span><span>  lian  coasting  trallie.  There  is  another</span><span>  ground,  too,  on  which  a  partial  tariff</span><span>  may  lie  justified  in  dealing  with  tho</span><span>  northern  pons.  The  farther  the  steamers</span><span>  gel  from  head  quarters  the  farther  from</span><span>  coal,  which  means  an  increased  expense</span><span>  in  working.  A  vessel  running  between</span><span>  Sydney  and  Townsville  can  fill  up  with</span></p> <p><span>  coal  whenever  the  fluctuations  of  trade</span><span>  do  not  allow  of  her  taking  a  full  cargo,</span><span>  whereas  a  sicamor  nianing  between</span><span>  Rockhampton  and  Townsville  musí</span><span>  have  coal  conveyed  to  her  by</span><span>  other  vessels.  Another  valid  ground</span><span>  on  which  advanced  charges  might</span><span>  be  made  in  the  north  is  the  want  of  back</span><span>  freight.  lieyond  lluwen  lhere  is  no</span><span>  pastoral  produce  or  copper  for  return</span><span>  loading,  and  hence  the  freights  to  those</span><span>  places""  naturally  range  higher  than  to</span><span>  ports  where  wool,  tallow,  hides,  pre-</span><span>  served  meats,  and  copper,  always  furnish</span><span>  profitai  ile  rein  ni  cargoes.  This,  how-</span><span>  ever,  does  not  justify  the  inequality  of</span><span>  which  Mr.  Jinx  complains,  and  which</span><span>  it  is  thc  duty  of  all  Queensland  mer-</span><span>  chants  to  pmlest  against  and  endeavour</span><span>  lo  rectify.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  readers  will  fully  appreciate  thc</span><span>  desire  expressed  by  the  several  speakers</span><span>  at  the  lîrisbane  meeting  lo  secure  the</span><span>  co-operation  of  the  northern  ports.</span><span>  There  is,  we  are  sure,  a  general  desire</span><span>  lo  reciprócale  these  overtures,  and  lo</span><span>  join  in  a  trading  alliance  thal  can  lie</span><span>  shown  to  be  mutually  advantageous  lo  ihe</span><span>  metropolis  and  ihe  other  ports  of  the</span><span>  colony.  It  would  be  a  good  thing  to</span><span>  have  a  steam  navigation  company  under</span><span>  the  sole  control  of  a  Queensland</span><span>  directory,  and  worked  with  an  exclusive</span><span>  regard  to  ihe  exigencies  of  Queensland</span></p> <p><span>  trade.  Union  is  strength,  and  if  heany</span><span>  co-operation  can  ht!  secured  between</span><span>  Brisbane  and  the  various  Northern</span><span>  Ports,  success  is  certain  to  attend  the</span><span>  projected  venture.  Hut  in  dealing  with</span><span>  a  Dialler  of  this  kind  it  is  necessary  for</span><span>  thc  negotiating  parlies  to  display  can-</span><span>  dour,  and  let  preliminary  objections  he</span></p> <p><span>  discussed  without  reservation.  If  there</span><span>  is  to  be  hearty  co-operation  lhere  must</span><span>  he  strict  mutuality,  and  in  order  to</span><span>  obtain  this  there  must  be  no  dashing</span><span>  of  interests.  Concessions  to  secure</span><span>  union  may  be  made  on  both  sides,  so</span><span>  long  as  they  do  not  involve  sacrifices</span><span>  likely  to  outweigh  the  advantage  to  be</span><span>  derived  from  the  compact.  The  question</span><span>  then  arises  whether,  in  the  milter  of  the</span><span>  proposed  Queensland  Steam  Navigation</span><span>  Company,  the  benefits  to  attend  its</span><span>  operations  will  he  universally  distributed,</span><span>  for  if  not  it  will  be  hopeless  to  expect</span><span>  to  establish  the  company  by  the  co</span><span>  operative  action  of  the  metropolitan  ami</span><span>  other  mercantile  communities  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  colony.  There  may  exist  among  these</span><span>  communities  the  most  hearty  gonil-wi!l,</span><span>  and  the  most  sincere  desire  to  promote</span><span>  tile  general  benefit  by  means  of  a  great</span><span>  joint  effort,  and  yet  difficulties  may  be</span><span>  in  thc  way  which  it  will  be  found  im-</span><span>  possible  to  overcome.  Wc  fear  some</span></p> <p><span>  such  difficulties  will  be  encountered  in</span></p> <p><span>  attempting  lo  establish  the  new  Queens-</span><span>  land  Steam  Navigation  Company.</span></p> <p><span>  Take  the  case  of  llrisbane  and  Rock-</span></p> <p><span>  hampton,  for  example.  It  may  be</span><span>  admitted,  if  requisite,  that  between  the</span><span>  merchants  of  the  two  ports  lhere  is  sincere</span><span>  friendshipand  mutual  esteem.  In  a  simple</span><span>  matter  of  precedence  each  may  be  willing</span><span>  to  yield  to  the  other,--the  metropolitan</span><span>  because  his  undoubted  strength  and</span><span>  resources  cannot  be  injured  by  any  ex-</span><span>  tent  of  mere  conventional  self-abasement;</span><span>  the  Rockhampton  man  because  his  com-</span><span>  mercial  inferiority  is  loo  marked  to  excite</span><span>  jealousy.  Hui  ihe  two  ate  active  rivals,</span><span>  nevertheless,  and  keenly  compete  for</span><span>  the  lion's  share  of  the  northern  trade.</span><span>  In  matters  of  courtesy  each  is  the</span><span>  ""humille  servant""  of  the  other,  but  in</span><span>  business  they  are  running  a  sharply</span></p> <p><span>  contesled  race  for  valuable  stakes.  To</span></p> <p><span>  tell  us  that  against  llrisbane  and  Sydney</span><span>  Rockhampton  has  no  chance  of  even  a</span><span>  share  of  the  prize,  is  beside  the  question.</span></p> <p><span>  Thc  very  remarks  made  by  Mr.  Hi  ix</span></p> <p><span>  as  to  the  treatment  Jîrisb.me  receives</span><span>  from  Sydney,  are  equally  .applicable  by</span><span>  the  Rockhampton  merchant  against</span></p> <p><span>  lîrisbane.  Thc  circumstance  thal</span></p> <p><span>  Rockhampton  and  lîrisbane  are</span><span>  politically  united  together,  while  they</span><span>  ave  both  severed  from  Sydney,  must</span><span>  be  allowed  little  weight.  The  merchant</span><span>  desirous  of  replenishing  his  stocks  goes</span><span>  lo  the  best  market,  and  whatever  his</span><span>  political  sympathies,  he  must  discard</span><span>  them  in  making  provision  for  the  exig-</span><span>  encies  of  profit  and  loss.  Otherwise  his</span><span>  collapse  is  only  a  question  of  time.  And</span><span>  so  with  the  proposed  steamship  com-</span><span>  pany.  The  directors  must  of  course</span><span>  work  ihe  business  of  the  company  from</span><span>  lîrisbane,  and  will  be  influenced  by</span><span>  motives  precisely  similar  to  those  which</span><span>  weigh  willi  the  directors  of  the  Sydney</span><span>  company,  ll  is  as  vitally  important  for</span></p> <p><span>  Brisbane  lo  become  lite  centre  of</span></p> <p><span>  Queensland  trade,  as  for  Sydney  to</span><span>  become  the  commercial  metropolis  of</span><span>  Australia.  And  il  is  unreasonable  to</span></p> <p><span>  expect  the  merchants  of  lîrisbane  to</span><span>  enter  into  any  compact,  by  virtue  of</span><span>  which  they  would  impartially  divide  the</span></p> <p><span>  northern  trade  between  themselves  and</span><span>  the  residents  of  Rockhampton.</span></p> <p><span>  ll  is  urged  that  the  mere  fart  of</span><span>  placing  opposition  steamers  on  our  coast</span><span>  must  be  advantageous,  in  a  greater  or</span><span>  less  degree,  to  the  traders  of  all  the</span><span>  northern  ports.  So  much  maj'  be</span><span>  admitted,  and  we  have  no  doubt  that</span><span>  wherever  an  opposition  boat  presented</span><span>  herself  she  would  receive  a  warm</span><span>  welcome,  and  obtain  a  full  share  of  the</span><span>  coasting  trade  of  the  colony.  Hui  in</span><span>  being  asked  to  co-operate  with  lîrisbane</span><span>  in  procuring  steamers,  our  merchants  are</span><span>  asked  to  provide  a.  portion  of  the</span><span>  necessaty  capital,  of  which  they  have</span><span>  really  none  lo  spare.  That  is,  the</span><span>  capital  at  their  command  can  be  much</span><span>  more  advantageously  appropriated,  and</span><span>  they  cannot  be  induced  lo  invest  money</span><span>  in  a  concern  without  gelling  security  for</span><span>  substantial  indirect  benefits,  al  least.  Thc</span><span>  simple  question  then  is,  Can  the</span><span>  projectors  of  the  new  company  offer</span><span>  such  security  ?</span></p> <p><span>  lt  is  a  well  known  aphorism  that  there</span><span>  is  no  friendship  in  business.  In  prac-</span><span>  tice,  perhaps,  the  principle  is  not  always</span><span>  observed.  There  is,  actually,  a  good</span><span>  deal  of  friendship  in  business,  and  within</span><span>  certain  limits  it  may  subsist  with  mutual</span><span>  advantage.  On  the  hypothesis  that</span><span>  lîrisbane  is  our  friend  and  Sydney  our</span><span>  foe,  a  Rockhampton  trade,  may  sin-</span><span>  cerely  desire  lo  give  the  preference  to</span><span>  the  friend.  Hut  he  is  also  bound  to</span><span>  calculate  how  much  that  preference  will</span><span>  cost  -whether  nothing,  or  five  per  cent</span><span>  on  the  amount  of  his  year's  transactions.</span><span>  If  the  latter,  he  must  perforce  discard</span><span>  friendship,  and  bestow  substantial  tokens</span><span>  of  regard  upon  his  enemy,  lie  may</span><span>  deeply  regret  this  necessity,  but  in  his</span><span>  case  profits,  peace  of  mind,  and  even</span><span>  solvency,  are  the  real  make-weights  in</span><span>  the  scale  against  friendship.</span></p> <p><span>  I'imlly,  the  question  for  our  lîrisbane</span><span>  friends  toconsider  is,  whether  theproposed</span><span>  company  can  be  so  conducted  as  lo  foster</span><span>  impartially  ihe  trade  of  all  the  Queensland</span><span>  ports.  Were  lîrisbane  the  geographical</span><span>  as  well  as  the  political  centre  of  the</span><span>  colony.  little  diliicully  would  be</span><span>  experienced.  lint  as  the  geographical</span><span>  position  «jf  Rockhampton  warrants  her</span><span>  merchants  in  aspiring  lo  a  profitable</span><span>  trade  with  the  ports  further  north,  she</span></p> <p><span>  is  bound  to  use  all  available  means  lo</span></p> <p><span>  promote  thal  trade,  liv  means  of  direct</span><span>  shipments  she  hopes  soon  lo  compele</span><span>  effectively  with  both  lîrisbane  and</span><span>  Sydney,  and  she  cannot  afford  lo  bend</span><span>  her  energies  in  any  direction  not  con-</span><span>  ducive  lo  that  end.  This  way  be</span><span>  deemed  presumptuous  ambition,  but  is  il</span><span>  not  justified  in  some  measure  by  the</span><span>  design  of  lîrisbane  upon  the  would-be</span><span>  ""commercial  metropolis  of  the  southern</span><span>  hemisphere?""</span></p> ",Article,1874-03-05,"The Rockhampton Bulletin, WITH WHICH IS INCORPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER.

The  exchequer</span><span>  of  the  Council  is  not  at  all  in  a  flourish-</span><span>  ing  condition,  for,  with  the  continued</span><span>  reduction  of  the  endowment,  the  interest</span><span>  remittances  on  the  government  loan,  and</span><span>  the  necessary  works  to  be  done,  a  great</span><span>  deal  of  good  management  is  requisite  to</span><span>  make  ends  meet.  It  is  now  becoming</span><span>  pretty  generally  admitted  that  the  dis-</span><span>  continuance  of  the  government  endow-</span><span>  ment  is  an  injustice  to  municipalities,  and</span><span>  that  if  the  ratepayers  consent  to  tax</span><span>  themselves  to  carry  out  public  works,</span><span>  they  are  entitled  to  some  assistance  from</span><span>  the  Treasury.  Outside  municipalities  the</span><span>  roads,  bridges,  and  waterworks  are</span><span>  carried  out  entirely  at  the  cost  of  the</span><span>  Central  Government,  and  it  is  there-</span><span>  fore  clearly  inequitable  to  insist  that</span><span>  within  municipal  boundaries,  improve-</span><span>  ments  shall  be  carried  out  by  means  of</span><span>  direct  local  taxation  alone.  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  is  no  doubt  exceptionally  favoured</span><span>  by  circumstances  in  regard  to  sources</span><span>  I  of  revenue.  A  considerable  income  is</span></p> <p><span>  derived  from  the  Market  Reserve,  from</span><span>  I  the  punts  and  ferries,  and  from  the</span></p> <p><span>  wharfage.  The  last  item  is  one  from</span><span>  which  the  Brisbane  Corporation  do  not</span><span>  obtain  a  shilling,  all  the  wharves  there</span><span>  being  in  the  ¡lands  of  the  Government  or</span><span>  of  private  persons.  Our  Municipal</span><span>  Council  have,  therefore,  very  properly</span><span>  recognised  the  peculiar  claim  which  the</span><span>  shipping  trade  of  the  port  has  upon  their</span><span>  attention.  Increased  business  means</span><span>  not  only  increased  revenue  from  assess-</span><span>  ments,  but  direct  income  from  wharfage</span><span>  in  addition,  and  it  would  be  a</span><span>  suicidal  policy  to  harass  the  trade</span><span>  of  the  port  by  a  want  of  wharfage</span><span>  accommodation.  It  is  this  consideration,</span><span>  we  presume,  which  has  induced  the</span><span>  Council  to  strain  a  point  in  order  to</span><span>  construct  two  additional  wharves  now.</span><span>  The  number  of  what  may  be  termed</span><span>  necessary  works  is  legion,  and  if  some</span><span>  ;£izoo  or  £1300  be  appropriated  to</span><span>  new  wharves  it  cannot  be  spent  in</span><span>  drainage,  in  forming  streets,  or  in</span><span>  metalling  roads.  As  an  isolated  matter,</span></p> <p><span>  drainage  is  perhaps  even  more  necessary</span><span>  than  additional  wharves.  Considerations</span><span>  of  health  demand  that  better  means  of</span></p> <p><span>  clearing  the  town  of  stagnant  and</span><span>  putrid  water  than  now  exist  shall  be</span><span>  quickly  devised.  In  this  matter  the</span><span>  Corporation  have  a  duty  which  they</span><span>  cannot  shirk.  But  it  must  not  be  for-</span><span>  gotten  that  those  who  use  the  wharves</span><span>  are  entitled  to  the  proposed  ex-</span><span>  penditure  on  account  of  past  contri-</span><span>  butions  to  the  municipal  revenue.  If</span><span>  the  trade  of  the  port  demands  it,  there</span><span>  is  surely  nothing  unreasonable  in  the</span><span>  claim  that  one  year's  revenue  from  the</span><span>  wharfage  should  be  devoted  to  its</span><span>  extension.  But  for  the  utter  impossi-</span><span>  bility  of  carrying  on  the  municipal</span><span>  affairs  without  some  impost  upon  trade,  it</span><span>  would  be  sound  policy  to  make  the  port</span><span>  free  as  far  as  wharfage  dues  are  con-</span><span>  cerned.  Our  aim  should  bc  to  attract</span><span>  atid  not  repel  shipping,  and  if  circum-</span><span>  stances  do  not  permit  of  wharf  accom-</span><span>  modation  being  provided  without  charge,</span><span>  it  is  both  our  interest  and  duty  to  see</span><span>  that  the  dues  are  spent  in  the  improve-</span><span>  ment  and  extension  of  our  wharfage.  It</span><span>  is  fortunate  for  the  trade  of  the  port  that</span><span>  we  have  several  mercantile  men  in  the</span><span>  Council,  and  that  they  perceive  the</span><span>  necessity  of  removing  all  impediments  in</span><span>  the  way  of  the  laking  in  and  discharge</span></p> <p><span>  of  cargo.  It  would  be  most  shortsighted  j</span><span>  policy  to  look  upon  the  income  from  j</span><span>  wharves  as  money  to  be  spent  in  im-  j</span></p> <p><span>  proving  the  streets  or  beautifying  the</span><span>  town.

From</span><span>  the  metropolis  down  to  Drayton-Rock-</span><span>  hampton  only  cxceptcd-lhe  various</span><span>  municipal  councils  appear  to  have  fallen</span><span>  almost  beneath  contempt.  This  dis</span><span>  esteem  is  certainly  not  without  justifica-</span><span>  tion,  although  possibly  the  more  patriotic</span><span>  course  would  be  to  encourage  and</span><span>  i  counsel,  rather  than  abuse  and  sneer  at</span></p> <p><span>  the  men  who  are  attempting'to  master</span><span>  thc  principles  and  practice  of  local  self</span><span>  government  It  is,  indeed,  an  unfortu-</span><span>  nate  thing  for  the  metropolitan  city  of</span><span>  Queensland  that  '  her  civic  dignitaries</span><span>  have  for  years  past  been  drawn  from  the</span><span>  ranks  of  third-rate  men,  and  that  in  con-</span><span>  sequence  the  city  has  in  «nany  respects</span><span>  been  allowed  to  go  to  the  dogs.  In  all</span><span>  Brisbane  there  is  not  even  one  well-kept</span><span>  thoroughfare,  while  it  is  only  in  one  or</span><span>  two  of  the  principal  streets  that  guttering</span><span>  and  kcrbing  has  been  even  tried.</span><span>  Generally  speaking  the  sanitory  condi-</span><span>  tion  of  the  city  is  simply  execrable,</span><span>  although  the  site  is  one  of  more  'than</span><span>  common  salubrity.  The  streets  at  night</span><span>  are  filled  with  a  poisonous  effluvia,  and</span><span>  judging  by  the  decaying  animal  matter</span><span>  strewn  about,  such  an  official  as  thc</span><span>  Inspector  of  Nuisances  does  not  exist.</span><span>  Such  a  state  of  affairs  in  the  capital  city</span><span>  of  Queensland,  where  the  assessments</span><span>  must  show  an  astonishing  annual  increase,</span><span>  is.  certainly  discreditable,  and  supplies  a</span><span>  powerful  argument  to  that  numerous</span><span>  ?  body  of  our  legislators  who  contend  that</span><span>  centralisation  is  thc  most  economical  and</span><span>  :  efficient  form  of  government</span></p> <p><span>  At  Maryborough  the  condition  o'</span><span>  affairs  is  even  worse.  That  town  is,  in</span><span>  fact,  just  now  in  the  throes  of  a  civic</span><span>  revolution.  Thc  lawfully  constituted</span><span>  authorities  have  abdicated  under  pressure</span><span>  of  public  opinion,  and  the  functions  o</span><span>  government  are  usurped  by  three  alder</span><span>  men,  who  refuse  to  relinquish  the  shabb)</span><span>  robes  of  office  in  which  they  have  beer</span><span>  clothed.  The  consequence  is  that  thc</span><span>  ratepayers  have  formed  themselves  inte</span><span>  a  committee  to  protect  the  public</span><span>  interest  and  arc  endeavouring  to  scenrt</span><span>  the  intervention  of  the  Central  Govern</span><span>  ment.  But  for  this  there  is  no  authority</span><span>  or  precedent,  and  the  Police  Magis</span><span>  trate  has  consequently  been  warnec</span><span>  not  to  interfere.  Here,  then,  is  ar</span><span>  actual  revolution  within  the  pcacefu</span><span>  colony  of  Queensland,  and  if  there  be  n&lt;</span><span>  barricades  in  the  streets,  and  no  riotoui</span><span>  demonstrations,  it  is  simply  because  ii</span><span>  the  breast  of  aU  Englishmen  there  is  ;</span><span>  respect  for  law  and  order,  even  whei</span><span>  law  and  order  have  been  superseded  b;</span></p> <p><span>  an  unlooked-for  accident.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Government  have  given  it  a</span><span>  their  opinion  that  the  Municipality  c</span><span>  Maryborough  has  utterly  collapsed,  aro</span><span>  that  if  its  re-establishment  be  desiret</span><span>  the  inhabitants  must  return  and  do  the</span><span>  first  works.  In  other  words,  the</span><span>  inuit  get  up  a  petition  for  incjrporatio</span><span>  i  &  .i  ""W"",  and  for  several  monti</span></p> <p><span>  at  least  remain  in  their  present  chkottc  j</span><span>  state.  This  is  an  uncomfortable  .  pro-</span><span>  spect,  for  however  badly  the  raunicipa}</span><span>  institution  may  have  worked,  its  6iidde&</span><span>  collapse  will  bc  attended  by  undesirable</span><span>  consequences.  The  principal  creditor,</span><span>  who  is  interested  to  the  extent  of  several</span><span>  thousands  of  pounds,  is  cheated  out  of</span><span>  every  scrap  of  security,  and  is  dependent.</span><span>  solely  upon  the  honour  and  good  faith'</span><span>  of  the  community.  Then,  with  a  defunct</span><span>  coqjoration,  the  collection  of  assess-</span><span>  ments,  wharf  dues,  and  tolls  must  be</span><span>  illegal,  and  in  this  manner  thc  town  will</span><span>  lose  a  very  large  proportion  of  its  revenue</span><span>  for  the  current  year.  Such  dues  and</span><span>  tolls,  we  ,are  informed,  are  being</span><span>  still  collected,  by  advice,  and  paid</span><span>  by  the  collectors  into  separate  trust</span><span>  accounts  at  the  National  Bank  ;  but  the</span><span>  irregularity  of  such  proceedings  must  be</span><span>  apparent,  and  in  the  event  of  persons</span><span>  refusing  to  pay  dues  and  tolls  it  would!</span><span>  be  impossible  to  compel  them.</span></p> <p><span>  Thc  situation  is  further  complicated  by</span><span>  the  persistence  of  the  three  aldermen</span><span>  who  still  hold  their  ground,  and,  despite</span><span>  protests,  arc  preparing  to  carry  on  an</span><span>  illegal  election.  That  ultimately  they</span><span>  must  surrender,  there  can  be  no  question,</span><span>  but  holding  for  the  present  the  key  to  the</span><span>  position,  it  may  be  in  their  power  to</span><span>  indefinitely  prolong  the  crisis.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  fortunate  for  the  inhabitants  of</span><span>  Maryborough  that  they  can  discover  a</span><span>  silver  lining  to  their  cloud  in  the</span><span>  circumstance  that  when  their  municipality</span><span>  1  comes  to  be  re-constituted  they  may</span></p> <p><span>  avoid  tile  mistakes  of  the  past.  One  of</span><span>  these  is  thc  inclusion  of  too  large  an</span><span>  area  within  the  civic  boundaries  ;  another,</span><span>  the  division  of  the  municipality  into</span><span>  wards  ;  and  a  third,  the  selection  of</span><span>  unfit  men  to  the  Council  board.  But</span><span>  persons  who  have  watched  the  conduct</span><span>  of  municipal  institutions  elsewhere,  will</span><span>  be  less  hopeful  of  any  great  reform  being</span><span>  effected  by  revolutionary  means.  The</span><span>  failure  of  self  government  at  Maryborough</span><span>  cannot  fairly  be  attributed  to  the</span><span>  excessive  area  of  the  municipality  or</span><span>  its  division  into  several  wards,</span><span>  but  to  the  pettiness  and  in-</span><span>  competency  of  the  aldermen.  .  And</span><span>  that  is  an  evil  which  will  not  be  easily</span><span>  remedied.  The  spirit  of  the  community</span><span>  at  Maryborough  is  jealous~arid  captious,</span><span>  and  whatever  changes  be  made  in  the</span><span>  constitution  and  personnel  of  the  Council,</span><span>  that  spirit  will  continue  lo  be  evinced  at</span><span>  the  Board  until  there  is  a  larger  infusion</span><span>  of  new  blood  into  thc.  town  than  has  yet</span><span>  occurred.  The  miserable  jealousy  always</span><span>  displayed  by  Maryborough  towards  her</span><span>  neighbours,  both  North  and  South,  is</span><span>  sufficiently  notorious,  and  thc  same  spirit</span><span>  is  constantly  evinced  by  her  leading</span></p> <p><span>  townsmen  towards  each  other.  Without</span></p> <p><span>  hearty  co-operation  for  the  public  good</span><span>  no  community  can  hope  to  succeed  in</span><span>  the  management  bf  its  public  institutions  ;</span><span>  and  unfortunately,  in  Maryborough,  co-</span><span>  operation  has  hitherto  been  found  imprac-</span><span>  ticable^  '  That  the  town  continues  to</span><span>  progress  .satisfactorily  is  due  to  the  varied</span><span>  resources  of  the  district,  and  to  the  un-</span><span>  common  development  which  has  taken</span><span>  place  in  them  through  the  introduction</span><span>  of  outside  capital.</span></p> <p><span>  The  advocates  of  local  self-government</span><span>  may  well  be  discouraged  at  the  present</span><span>  aspect  of  affairs  in  different  parts  of  thc</span><span>  colony,  but  they  may  draw  comfort  from</span><span>  the  thought  that  Dieir  principles  are</span><span>  founder!  npnn  the  expetienee-of  Anglo</span><span>  Saxon  communities  elsewhere,  and  can-</span><span>  not  be  overturned  by  .  the  blunders  ol</span><span>  incapable  men  in  our  at  present  crude</span><span>  state  of  society.</span></p> <p><span>  I  THE  adjourned  mooting  of  tue  Philarmonic</span><span>  j  Society  will  bo  bold  this  evening,  in  the  School</span></p> <p><span>  of  Arts,  Bolsover-Btreet,  at  eight  o'clock.</span><span>  Members  of  thc  society  and  all  that  arc  inter-</span><span>  ested  arc  respectfully  invited  to  attend.</span></p> <p><span>  ALTHOUGH  tho  official  Post-office  notice</span><span>  states  that  thc  uoxt  Torres  Straits  mail  will</span><span>  be  made  up  to-morrow,  it  is  perfectly  clear</span><span>  that  a  postponement  must  take  place,  os  no</span><span>  steamer  is  in  readiness  to  take  the  mail.

His  notorious</span><span>  frailty  as  a  promise-breaker  is  not  due  so</span><span>  much  to  want  of  good  faith  as  to  that</span><span>  rashness  of  disposition  which  leads  him</span><span>  to  make  promises  which  a  few  moments</span><span>  consideration  would  convince  him  it</span><span>  would  be  difficult  to  perform.  It  is  this</span><span>  impulsiveness  also  which  leads  the  hon.</span><span>  gentleman  into  expressions  which,  how-</span><span>  ever  sincere,  are  equally  untrue  and</span><span>  unbecoming.  As  PREMIER  he  of</span><span>  course  professes  an  important  regard</span><span>  for  thc  well-being  of  the  whole</span><span>  colony,  but  against  certain  portions  of  it</span><span>  he  has  an  unmistakeable  and  deep-rooted</span><span>  prejudice.  He  has  a  perfect  horror  of</span><span>  Rockhampton,  for  example,  and  can</span><span>  seldom  resist  the  temptation  of  giving  it</span><span>  a  blow  when  opportunity  offers.  Yes-</span><span>  terday  fortnight  the  hon.  gentleman  con-</span><span>  demned  that  section  of  the  Immigration</span><span>  Act  which  provides  that  one-half  thc</span><span>  vessels  shall  be  despatched  to  thc</span><span>  northern  ports.  And  in  condemning</span><span>  the  Act  he  found  an  illustration  in  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  :  ""  Had  it  not  been,""  he  said,</span><span>  ""  that  a  large  number  of  the  arrivals  by</span><span>  ""  the  last  vessel  at  Rockhampton  had</span><span>  ""  been  employed  on  the  Government</span><span>  ""  works  going  on  there,  they  would  have</span><span>  ""  become  paupers.""  For  this  he  was  taken</span><span>  to  task  next  day  by  our  member,  who</span><span>  moved  the  adjournment  of  the  House  to</span><span>  make  an  explanation  on  the  subject.  He</span><span>  said,  as  will  be  seen  by  the  report,  that</span><span>  the  immigrants  could  not  get  employment,</span><span>  not  because  it  was  scarce,  but  because</span><span>  they  were-nftt  fit  for  any  kind  of  work  in</span><span>  the  colony.  To  this,  the  PREMIER  made</span><span>  no  answer,  but  the  MINISTER  for  WORKS</span><span>  replied  that  the  hon.  member  had</span><span>  repeated  exactly  what  the  PREMIER</span><span>  originally  said.  Looking  at  the  Courier's</span><span>  report,  this  answer  is  amusing,  and  it</span></p> <p><span>  seems  odd  that  Mr.  MACALISTER  allowed</span></p> <p><span>  the  misrepresentation  to  pass.  As</span><span>  yet,  Hansard  has  not  reached  us,</span><span>  but  anyone  who  compares  Mr.</span><span>  MACALISTER'S  speech  with  the  correction</span><span>  made  by  Mr.  BUZACOTT  must  conclude</span><span>  that  in  this  instance,  impulse  led  the</span><span>  PREMIER  into  an  unjustifiable  attack</span><span>  upon  Rockhampton.  His  object  was</span><span>  palpable,  and  it  was  fortunate  that  a</span><span>  prompt  contradiction  was  supplied.</span><span>  The  present  Government  only  want  an</span><span>  excuse  .for  defrauding  us  of  our  share  of</span><span>  immigration,  as  they  havs  already  de-</span><span>  frauded  us  of  our  share  of  the  public</span><span>  money  and  mail  communication.  It</span><span>  may  be  hoped,  however,  that  alL  the</span><span>  Ministers  are  not  as  implacable  as  the</span></p> <p><span>  PREMIER.</span></p> <p><span>  PERHAPS  of  all  the  present  ministers,</span><span>  Mr.  HEMMANT  is  the  least  oojectionable</span><span>  to  the  public  in  this  part  of  the  colony.</span><span>  Mr.  M'ILWRAITH  is,  for  the  present  at</span><span>  any  rate,  under  a  deep  cloud,  although</span><span>  sanguine  persons  amongst  us  are  not</span><span>  without  hope  of  his  ""turning  up  trumps""</span><span>  after  all.  But  Mr.  HEMMANT,  as</span><span>  Treasurer.has  perhaps  given  less  cause  for</span><span>  offence  than  his  colleagues.  The  hon.</span><span>  gentleman  is  regarded  as  big  wit  .h  promise,</span><span>  for  has  he  not  assured  our  triember  that</span><span>  whatever  sum  may  _  be  necessary</span><span>  to  improve  the  naviga'cion  of  thc</span><span>  Fitzroy  shall  be  gre  Med  ?

CHARLES</span><span>  LILLEY  as  one  of  the  Puisne  Judges  was</span><span>  a  ceremony  not  altogether  devoid  of</span><span>  public  interest.  The  learned  profession,</span><span>  in  both  branches,  was  very  largely  repre-</span><span>  sented,  wc  are  told,  and  there  was  also  a</span><span>  sprinkling  of  curious  spectators  drawn</span><span>  from  that  outside  public  which  in  former</span><span>  days  it  was  Mr.  LILLEV'S  distinguished</span><span>  honour  and  unequivocal  pleasure  to</span><span>  represent  in  Parliament.  The  proceed-</span><span>  ings  opened  with  reading  the  commis-</span><span>  sion,  and  would  probably  have  ended  in</span><span>  a  most  matter-of-fact  way,  but  for  the</span><span>  discovery  made  by  the  third  Judge  that</span><span>  the  new  Supreme  Court  Act,  to  which</span><span>  Mr.  LILLEY  himself  owed  his  appoint-</span><span>  ment,  threatened  to  interfere  with</span><span>  the  independer.ee  of  the  Judicial</span><span>  Bench.  The  defect  was  thal  thc  Act</span><span>  which  gave  thc  Cíovcrnmcnl  power  lo</span><span>  appoint,  also  empowered  them  to  re-</span><span>  move  a  Judges  to  the  Northern  Districts,</span></p> <p><span>  or,  to  speak  with  more  definiteness,  to</span><span>  Bowen.  Mr.  LILLEY  wished  it  distinctly</span><span>  understood  that,  iii  accepting  the  ap-</span></p> <p><span>  pointment,  he  had  stipulated  that  on  no  '</span><span>  account  should  he  be  sent  to  Bowen,</span><span>  that,  in  short,  he  should  be  permanently</span><span>  stationed  in  the  Southern  District  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  colony.  The  very  fact  of  such  a  stipu-</span><span>  lation  being  made  at  once  aroused  the</span><span>  CHIEF  JUSTICE,  who  thought  it  due  to</span><span>  himself  to  see  that  the  independence  of</span><span>  the  Bench  was  not  tampered  with</span><span>  by  the  possibility  of  his  being  sent  to</span><span>  Bowen.  It  is  quite  clear  that  His</span><span>  HONOR  will  be  justified  in  a  vigorous</span><span>  attempt  at  self-preservation  in  this</span><span>  matter,  for  it  is  not  to  be  tolerated  that</span><span>  the  Chief  Justice  of  the  colony  should  hold</span><span>  hts  seat  on  any  less  advantageous  terms</span><span>  or  less  secure  tenure  than  a  newly  ap-</span><span>  pointed  judge.  There  is  no  doubt  that</span><span>  the  new  Supreme  Court  Act  must  be</span><span>  amended,  and  that  some  better  security</span><span>  for  the  independence  of  the  Bench  is</span><span>  required  than  the  mere  assurance  of  the</span><span>  ATTORNEV-GENERAL  that  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  have  no  intention  to  interfere.</span><span>  The  intentions  of  the  Government  arc  not</span><span>  like  the  laws  of  the  Medes  and  Persians,</span><span>  and  were  undue  power  permanently</span><span>  vested  in  them  in  this  particular,  there  is</span><span>  no  knowing  how  soon  an  obnoxious</span></p> <p><span>  judge  might  be  relegated  to  that  sana-</span><span>  torium  of  the  tropics  which  most  men</span><span>  in  their  vigour  are  desirous  to  avoid.  Port</span><span>  Denison  is  no  doubt  a  very  fine  habitat</span><span>  for  invalids,  but  it  is  not  by  any  means</span><span>  an  attractive  location  to  cultivated  men</span><span>  who  find  intellectual  society  and  the</span><span>  refinements  of  civilised  life  scarcely  less</span><span>  essential  to  thc  satisfactory  performance</span><span>  of  their  official  duties  than  to  complete-</span><span>  ness  of  their  personal  comfort</span></p> <p><span>  It  is,  however,  not  the  opinion  of  the</span><span>  Judges  alone  that  the  Supreme  Court</span><span>  Act  must  be  amended.  It  is  believed</span></p> <p><span>  by  many  of  those  best  able  to  judge  that</span><span>  Bowen  will  be  found  wholly  unsuited</span><span>  to  be  the  headquarters  of  the  Supreme</span><span>  Court  in  the  north,  and  that  when  the</span><span>  fourth  Judge  is  located,  his  place  of</span></p> <p><span>  residence  will  not  bc  at  Port  Denison.</span><span>  But  this  is  a  matter  which  need  not  here</span></p> <p><span>  be  further  discussed,  and  our  readers</span><span>  may  rest  assured  that  time  will  bring  its</span></p> <p><span>  own  revenges.</span></p> <p><span>  In  replying  to  the  felicitations  of  thc</span><span>  ATTORNEY-GENERAL,  Mr.  LILLEY  con-</span><span>  gratulated  himself  on  the  circumstance</span><span>  that  during  a  long  career  he  had  not</span><span>  made  a  single  personal  enemy  in  the</span><span>  profession.  This  perhaps  is  not  equally</span><span>  true  with  regard  to  the  honorable  gentle-</span><span>  man's  political  career  ;  but,  having  regard</span><span>  to  the  extreme  course  taken  by  him  on</span><span>  more  than  one  occasion,  and  particularly</span><span>  during  those  discreditable  deadlocks</span><span>  which  proved  so  injurious  to  the</span><span>  country,  it  is  a  matter  for  satisfaction</span><span>  that  Mr.  LILLEY  made  so  few  personal</span><span>  enemies  as  he  unquestionably  did.  This,</span><span>  however,  is  probably  attributable  to  the</span><span>  fact  that  few  antagonists  of  the  learned</span><span>  gentleman  in  the  parliamentary  arena</span><span>  could  get  rid  of  the  impression  that  he</span><span>  was  acting  the  part  of  an  advocate,  or</span><span>  refuse  to  believe  that  his  greatest  displays</span><span>  of  indignation  were  simply  put  on  for  the</span><span>  occasion.  The  smirk  of  insincerity</span><span>  accompanied  the  most  sweeping  tirade,</span><span>  and  the  deepest  emotions  were</span><span>  apparently  at  all  times  perfectly  under</span></p> <p><span>  command.  Yet  with  all  this  there  was</span></p> <p><span>  not  one  of  our  public  men  who,  in</span><span>  addressing  a  crowd,  could  assume  so</span><span>  convincing  a  show  of  real  earnestness,</span><span>  or  play  more  effectually  upon  the</span><span>  sympathies  of  his  audience.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  every  reason  to  believe  that</span><span>  Mr.  LILLEY  will  make  a  clever,  careful,</span><span>  and  impartial  judge.  His  past  career</span><span>  shows  that  his  dislikes  are  the  objects  of</span><span>  impulse  rather  than  vindictiveness.  He</span><span>  is  by  nature  a  stranger  to  ""  hatred,  malice,</span><span>  and  all  uncharitableness,""  and  it  is  not</span><span>  to  be  wondered  at,  therefore,  that  he  has</span><span>  few,  if  any,  enemies.  Enmity  must  be</span><span>  reciprocal  or  its  vitality  will  soon  dis-</span><span>  appear,  and  enmity  is  a  sentiment  that</span><span>  Mr.  LILLEY  never  evinced  any  disposition</span></p> <p><span>  to  cherish.</span></p> <p><span>  Nor  is  there  much  to  be  dreaded  from</span></p> <p><span>  deep-seated  political  prejudice.  Thc</span><span>  new  Judge  is  now  lifted  far  above  the</span><span>  intrigues  of  politics  and  the  tricks  of</span><span>  legislation.  Reposing  on  his  well-won</span><span>  laurels  and  ermine,  and  placed</span><span>  by  his  stipend  far  beyond  the</span><span>  reach  of  anxiety  in  pecuniary  matters,</span><span>  Mr.  Justice  LILLEY  will  regard  the  past</span><span>  without  acrimony.  It  is  easy  for  him  to</span><span>  laugh  who  wins,  and  a  man  whose  career</span><span>  is  one  of  unqualified  success,  can  afford</span><span>  to  look  kindly  on  old  opponents  and</span><span>  competitors.</span></p> <p><span>  The  time,  however,  is  fast  approaching</span><span>  when  the  single  step  from  party  politics</span><span>  straight  to  the  judicial  bench  will  be</span><span>  removed,  and  when  a  judgeship  will  be</span><span>  only  attained  after  years  of  patient  labour</span><span>  at  the  bar,  and  after  a  lengthened  and</span><span>  unsullied  career  as  a  private  citizen.  It</span><span>  may  bc  hoped  that  ere  long  our  Attor-</span><span>  ney-Generals  will  be  non-political,  and</span><span>  that  a  Minister  of  Justice  will  be  en-</span><span>  trusted  with  the  parliamentary  duties  now</span><span>  improperly  imposed  upon  the  Grand</span><span>  Juror  of  thc  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  I  TUE  usual  monthly  mooting  ot  tho  com-</span></p> <p><span>  mittee  of  tho  Port  Curtis  and  Leichhardt</span><span>  District  Hospital  Trill  he  hold  in  thc  Court</span><span>  House  this  afternoon  at  four  o'clock.</span></p> <p><span>  Tin:  manner  in  which  Shakespeare's  fine</span><span>  comedy,  ""  The  Taming  of  thc  Shrew,""  was</span><span>  put  upon  the  stage  last  evening  at  thc  Theatre</span><span>  Hoya!  merited  a  mach  better  house  thau  was</span><span>  present.

The  MAYOR,  reflecting</span><span>  no  doubt  the  feelings  of  many  persons</span><span>  in  thc  community,  was  prepared  to  show</span><span>  HER  MAJESTY'S  representative  the</span><span>  customary  loyal  respect  ;  but  the  circum-</span><span>  stance  that  His  EXCELLENCY  would  be</span><span>  accompanied  by  Mr.  MACALISTER,  he  (the</span><span>  MAYOR)  felt  to  be  an  obstacle  to  any</span><span>  public  demonstration.  He  therefore</span><span>  wished  to  ascertain  the  opinion  of  the</span><span>  Council  on  thc  matter.  The  aldermen  ;</span><span>  appeared  taken  somewhat  by  surprise,</span><span>  for  expressions  were  let  fall  which  can</span><span>  be  excused  on  no  other  ground.  One</span><span>  gentleman  not  only  objected  to  enter-</span><span>  taining  an  unpopular  minister,  but  con-</span><span>  sidering  a  higher  personage  responsible</span><span>  for  the  scant  justice  meted  out</span><span>  to  the  '  central  districts,  was</span><span>  opposed  to  any  demonstration  whatever.</span><span>  This  was  a  mistake  which  so  old  a  public</span><span>  man  as  Mr.  FEEZ  ought  not  to  have</span><span>  fallen  into.  He  has  for  many  years  been</span><span>  living  under  constitutional  government,</span><span>  and  must  be  well  aware  that  ""  the  king</span><span>  can  do  no  wrong.""  If  wrong  be  done,</span><span>  the  fault  lies  with  the  advisers  of  the</span><span>  Crown,  who  are  solely  responsible  to  the</span><span>  people  ;  and  if  we  as  a  community  have</span><span>  to  complain  of  injustice,  the  blame  must</span><span>  be  imputed  to  the  Ministry,  and  to  them</span><span>  alone.  The  question,  therefore,  as  to</span><span>  entertaining  His  EXCELLENCY  is  entirely</span><span>  distinct  from  any  consideration  as  to  thc</span><span>  treatment  the  town  and  district  has</span><span>  received  from  the  Government,  and  it  is</span><span>  rather  unfortunate  that  this  was  not  more</span><span>  clearly  laid'down  by  the  Mayor  in  his</span><span>  opening  remarks.  We  are  quite  sure,</span><span>  however,  that  no  mark  of  disrespect</span><span>  was  intended  to  the  GOVERNOR,  and  that</span><span>  thc  Aldermen  of  Rockhampton  would  be</span><span>  amongst  the  first  to  resent  any</span><span>  such  proceeding.  On  the  contrary,  they</span><span>  arc  well  aware  that  the  colony  owes  much</span><span>  to  His  EXCELLENCY,  But  for  his  firm-</span></p> <p><span>  ness  in  vindicating  constitutional  practice</span><span>  on  his  first  arrival  in  the  colony,  irrepar-</span><span>  able  mischief  would  have  been  done  to</span><span>  our  free  institutions  ;  and,  instead  of  the</span><span>  comparative  general  contentment  which</span><span>  followed  the  impartial  administration  of</span><span>  the  PALMER  Government,  we  should</span><span>  have  seen  the  residents  of  the  various</span></p> <p><span>  districts  of  the  colony  split  up  into</span><span>  hostile  factions,  and  have  witnessed  as</span><span>  near  an  approach  to  anarchy  as  was  pos-</span><span>  sible  in  a  community  of  Englishmen</span><span>  enjoying  the  privileges  of  self-government</span><span>  In  thc  Central  Districts  we  have  special</span><span>  reasonstobe  grateful  lo  Hts  EXCELLENCY,</span><span>  for  his  happy  and  distinct  enunciation  of</span><span>  constitutional  principles  ;  for,  however</span></p> <p><span>  much  reason  there  may  be  for  complaint</span><span>  at  present,  our  case  would  liave  been  in-</span><span>  finitely  worse  had  a  weak-minded  or</span><span>  popularity-seeking  Governor  been  sta-</span><span>  tioned  amongst  us  at  that  juncture.  It</span><span>  is  quite  clear  that  if  there  are  to  be  future</span><span>  dead-locks  in  the  Assembly,  it  will  not</span><span>  be  the  fault  of  thc  noble  lord  who,  fortu-</span><span>  nately,  is  the  representative  of  HER</span><span>  MAJESTV  in  Quecnland  at  the  present</span></p> <p><span>  time.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  also,  we  believe,  a  mistake  to</span><span>  suppose  that  the  GOVERNOR  desires  any</span><span>  organised  public  demonstration  of</span><span>  welcome  on  his  arrival.  The  presump-</span><span>  tion  is  that  he  will  but  too  gladly  escape</span><span>  the  reception  of  addresses  from  the</span><span>  Municipal  Council  and  other  public</span><span>  bodies.  Such  ceremonies  must  not  be</span></p> <p><span>  too  often  repeated,  or  they  become  dis-</span><span>  tasteful  and  wearisome.  In  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  we  gave  Hts  EXCELLENCY  an</span><span>  enthusiastic  reception  on  his  first  arrival</span><span>  tn  the  colony,  and  although  there  is  no</span><span>  reason  to  regretv  that  step,  we  know  of</span></p> <p><span>  no  special  reason  why  it  should  be  j</span><span>  repeated  now.  It  has  not  yet  been  i</span></p> <p><span>  announced  that  the  tour  is  an  official</span></p> <p><span>  one.  We  shall  all  be  glad  to  see  our  ;</span><span>  excellent  GOVERNOR  again  amongst  us,  ;</span><span>  and  if  occasion  offer,  shall  be  prepared</span><span>  to  testify  our  loyalty  in  no  ambiguous</span><span>  manner;  hut  it  seems  no  particular</span><span>  occasion  for  any  great  display,  and  pro-</span><span>  bably,  tinder  the  circumstances,  an</span><span>  exhibition  of  overflowing  '  enthusiasm</span><span>  would  only  give  rise  to  suspicion.  At</span><span>  thc  same  time,  some  opportunity  should</span><span>  he  afforded  the  citizens  of  meeting  the</span></p> <p><span>  GOVERNOR,  and  of  suitably  testifying  j</span><span>  their  loyalty  to  thc  Crown,  and  their</span><span>  high  appreciation  of  its  distinguished</span><span>  representative  in  the  colony.  Judging</span><span>  from  the  result  of  the  discussion  yester-</span><span>  day  afternoon,  however,  the  Mayor  and</span><span>  Aldermen  may  be  trusted  to  do  their</span><span>  duty  in  the  matter  at  the  proper  time.</span></p> <p><span>  The  public  will,  to  some  extent,</span><span>  sympathise  with  the  unwillingness  felt  by</span><span>  certain  members  of  the  Council  to  join</span><span>  in  any  demonstration  which  would</span><span>  imply  satisfaction  with  Mr.  MACALISTER.</span></p> <p><span>  But  wc  have  no  hesitation  in  :</span><span>  saying  that  no  such  aversion  must</span><span>  be  betrayed  if  we  desire  to  entertain</span><span>  the  GOVERNOR.  Mr.  MACALISTER  comes</span></p> <p><span>  to  us  not  in  the  capacity  of  a  personal</span><span>  friend,  but  as  the  first  Minister  of  the</span><span>  Crown,  and  he  is  entitled  to  be  treated</span><span>  with  consideration  and  respect.  We</span><span>  cannot  dissociate  him  from  his  official</span><span>  position.

Omitting  to  keep  proper  books  of</span></p> <p><span>  account.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  perhaps  sufficient  for  the  honest</span><span>  debtor  that  lie  will  escape  all  penalties</span><span>  on  satisfying  thc  jury  that  he  had  no</span><span>  intent  to  defraud  or  conceal  the  true</span><span>  state  of  his  affairs.

Section  209  imposes  a</span><span>  penalty  of  one  year's  imprisonment  upon</span><span>  any  creditor  making  a  false  claim.

Its</span><span>  effect  upon  the  system  of  credit,</span><span>  upon  which  nearly  the  whole  of  our</span><span>  business  is  conducted,  may  be  expected</span><span>  to  be  great  and  beneficial.  Credit  is  the</span><span>  outcome  of  confidence  between  seller</span><span>  and  buyer,  and  the  tendency  of  the  new</span><span>  Act  will  bc,  we  think,  to  foster  confidence</span><span>  by  discountenancing  and  punishing  dis-</span><span>  honesty.  One  feature  of  the  Act  may  be</span><span>  referred  to  as  unique.  The  fraudulent</span><span>  '  creditor,  as  well  as  the  fraudulent  debtor,</span></p> <p><span>  is  brought  within  the  scope  of  its  penal</span><span>  clauses,  a  provision  which  probably  sup-</span></p> <p><span>  plies  a  better  guarantee  against  roguery  j</span><span>  than  any  penalty  yet  devised.  On  the  ]</span><span>  i  whole,  the  new  Act  is  certainly  a  good  one,</span></p> <p><span>  and,  although  not  perfect  in  all  its  details,</span><span>  '  its  principles  come  to  us  from  other</span></p> <p><span>  countries,  where  the  brightest  intellects</span><span>  of  the  age  have  been  engaged  in  perfect-</span><span>  ing  legislation  upon  the  subject.  Of</span><span>  course  much  -.viii  depend  upon  the  ad-</span><span>  ministration  of  the  new  law,  but  if  our</span><span>  courts,  legal  practioners,  and  merchants</span><span>  combine  to  give  it  free  scope,  there  need</span><span>  be  little  apprehension  as  to  the  eventual</span></p> <p><span>  result.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  aro  informed  that  it  is  contemplated  to</span><span>  Btart  Turkish  Baths  in  Rockhampton,  on  tho</span><span>  premises  lately  occupied  by  Mr.  M.

Al  a  lime  like  thc  present,</span><span>  when  houses  in  Rockhampton  are  not  lo</span><span>  he  procured,  and  when  many  families  are</span><span>  obliged  to  occupy  buildings  neither  com-</span><span>  fortable  norhcaliliful,  the  i|ueslion  how  to</span><span>  increase  anil  improve  the  dwellings  of  the</span><span>  people  is  one  of  much  importance.  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  has  long  since  passed  through</span><span>  the  mushroom  stage  of  existence,  bul</span><span>  its  house  accommodation  has  not  ad-</span><span>  vanced  with  the  times,  and  is,  in  fact,</span></p> <p><span>  inferior  lo  that  provided  in  any  town  in  :</span><span>  thc  souillent  part  of  the  colony.  At  thc</span><span>  same  time,  climatic  peculiarities  render  it</span><span>  very  desirable  that,  in  point  of  roominess</span><span>  and  ventilation  at  least,  our  dwellings</span><span>  should  he  superior  to  those  in  use  where</span><span>  less  intense,  or  any  rate,  less  prolonged</span><span>  heat  of  the  weather  has  to  be  contended</span></p> <p><span>  against.  But  property  owners  tell  us  that  j</span><span>  house-building  in  Rockhampton,  except</span><span>  for  business  purposes,  is  an  unre</span><span>  munerativc  investment,  and  thai  they</span></p> <p><span>  can  use  their  limited  means  to  much</span><span>  better  advantage.  They  admit  thal</span><span>  good  rents  may  be  obtained,  but</span><span>  these,  through  the  heavy  cost  of  repairs</span><span>  and  rapid  depreciation  of  buildings,  do</span><span>  not  in  the  long  run  rctum  the  house</span><span>  owner  bank  interest.  And  as  he  is</span><span>  always  subject  lo  the  risk  of  having  his</span><span>  houses  tenantless,  the  investment  is  not</span><span>  by  any  means  an  attractive  one.</span></p> <p><span>  One  great  «use  of  the  landlord's</span><span>  troubles  is  the  scarcity  and  costliness  of</span><span>  good  building  materials.  Wooden  houses</span><span>  are  preferred  for  dwellings,  bul</span><span>  unless  substantially  built  throughout</span><span>  of  hardwood,  they  often  prove  bul  very</span><span>  temporary  structures,  il  is  now  pretty</span><span>  generally  held  thal,  as  a  nile,  wooden</span><span>  buildings,  to  be  remunerative,  must  yield</span><span>  a  rent  which  will  return  the  principal  in</span><span>  five  years.  On  this  calculation,  a  ¡louse</span><span>  costing  ^300  should  produce  a  rental</span><span>  of  not  less  than  £60  per  annum</span><span>  an  amount  of  return  which  under</span></p> <p><span>  no  ordinary  circumstances  can  be  hoped</span><span>  for.  There  is  a  prejudice  against  brick</span><span>  dwellings,  on  the  ground  that  they  are</span><span>  usually  close,  frequently  damp,  and</span><span>  generally  unwholesome.  Rockhampton</span><span>  bricks  .-ire  at  best  bad,  and  therefore  no</span><span>  one  uses  them  for  dwelling-houses  unless</span><span>  under  compulsion.

With  the  exercise  of</span></p> <p><span>  ordinary  care  and  judgment,  a  working</span><span>  man,  by  becoming  his  own  landlord,  may</span><span>  pretty  confidently  reckon  on  a  handsome</span><span>  return  upon  his  savings,  beside  ensuring</span><span>  lo  his  family  far  more  comfortable</span><span>  (platters  than  would  otherwise  be  pro-</span></p> <p><span>  curable.</span></p> <p><span>  The  motto  of  liuilding  Societies  is,</span><span>  ""livery  man  his  own  landlord,""  and  there</span></p> <p><span>  can  be  no  doubl  that  iinderfavourable  «¡1</span></p> <p><span>  ciunslances  Ibo  practice  of  such  societies</span><span>  ,  is  ciptal  to  their  professions.

A  borrower  may,  in  certain</span><span>  cases,  pay  a  high  rate  of  interest,  but  as</span><span>  without  thc  help  of  a  building  society  he</span><span>  could  not  have  been  a  borrower  at  all,</span><span>  exceptional  circumstances  may  justify</span><span>  what  would  otherwise  be  excessive  pay-</span><span>  ments  for  monetary  accommodation</span></p> <p><span>  Huilding  Societies  aie  primarily  in-</span><span>  tended  for  thc  man  of  small  means,  and</span><span>  for  the  fostering  of  thrifty  and  frugal</span><span>  habits  amongst  persons  in  receipt</span></p> <p><span>  of  fixed  incomes.  It  has  been</span></p> <p><span>  argued  with  much  force  that</span><span>  if  a  man  can  live  on  one  pound  a-week,</span><span>  he  may,  by  denying  himself  some  small</span><span>  luxury,  live  upon  nineteen  shillings  and</span></p> <p><span>  save  the  balance.  An  inducement  to</span><span>  self-denial  in  such  a  case  is  needed,  and</span><span>  that  is  supplied  by  the  building  society.</span><span>  I  jet  us  suppose  the  case  of  a  mechanic</span><span>  earning  three  pounds  per  week.  Jf  not</span><span>  burdened  with  a  large  family  he  might</span><span>  live  comfortably  on  two-thirds  of  that</span><span>  sum,  or.  al  any  rate,  pay  a  house</span><span>  rent  of  len  shillings  and  save  ten.</span><span>  He  is  in-possession  of  £100  cash,  and,</span><span>  intending  to  build  a  cottage  for  himself,</span><span>  wishes  to  borrow  ^200  for  that  purpose.</span><span>  ""He  takes  four  shares  in  a  building</span><span>  society,  the  ultimate  value  of  which,  al</span></p> <p><span>  ¿50  each,  will  be  .£200.  He  then  ></span></p> <p><span>  borrows  the  whole  amount  of  his  shares</span><span>  al  the  rate  of  fourteen  per  cent  per</span><span>  anmmi.  His  payments  to  the  society</span><span>  will  then  be-Subscriptions  on  four</span><span>  shares,  £2  per  month  ;  interest  at</span></p> <p><span>  ¿14  per  cent,  £1  6s.  Sd.;  total,  ¿£4  ;</span><span>  ?5s.  fA.  per  month,  or  just  ,£52  per  j</span><span>  annum.  This  is  equal  to  £\  per</span></p> <p><span>  week,  or  exaelly  the  amount  of  '</span><span>  his  ordinary  house-rent  and  savings.</span><span>  He  is  now  rent  free,  and  at</span><span>  thc  end  of  five  years  and  a-half</span><span>  thc  society  winds  up,  and  our  friend's</span><span>  property  is  clear  of  liability.  He  bxs</span><span>  liad  the  use  of  the  society's  money  for</span><span>  thc  whole  term,  and  has  paid  back,  in</span><span>  all,  or  ,£86  more  than  he  origin-</span><span>  ally  borrowed.  His  interest  has  thus</span><span>  been  below  the  rate  of  eight  per  cent,</span><span>  per  annum,  and  the  money  having  been</span><span>  relumed  in  monthly  instalments,  he  has</span><span>  never  felt  the  payments  burdensome.</span><span>  Such  a  man  would  have  been  unable  to</span><span>  borrow  .£200  from  a  money-lender,  bul</span><span>  it  will  be  interesting  lo  compare  the  cost</span><span>  of  the  loan  in  such  a  case.  Thc  interest</span><span>  on  ¿£200,  al  io  per  cent  per  annum,</span><span>  would  amount  for  the  live  years  and</span><span>  a-half  to  ¿£110,  after  payment  of</span></p> <p><span>  which  the  borrower  must  return  the</span></p> <p><span>  whole  of  thc  original  loan.  H  is  thus</span><span>  clearly  shown  that  by  borrowing</span><span>  from  the  building  society,  ni  the  high</span><span>  rate  of  fourteen  per  cent,  he  has  gained</span><span>  just  ,£24.  There  is  no  possible  jugglery</span><span>  in  these  figures,  and  their  correctness</span><span>  has  been  repeatedly  demonstrated  by</span><span>  practice.  The  truth  is  that  the  members</span><span>  of  building  societies  mutually  shale  in</span><span>  thc  profits,  and  thus  thc  borrower,  while</span><span>  paying  interest  on  the  advance  received,</span><span>  is  also  credited  with  interest  paid  by</span><span>  other  shareholders  on  the  money  he</span><span>  returns  to  the  society.  The  profits  of</span><span>  building  societies  are  also  much</span><span>  enhanced  by  temporary  advances  from</span><span>  their  bankers.  For  these  they  pay</span><span>  interest  at  the  rate  of  (say)  eight  per</span><span>  cent,  while  they  re-lend  the  money  at</span><span>  rates  varying  from  thirteen  to  fifteen  per</span><span>  \  cent.</span></p> <p><span>  The  illustration  we  have  given  proves</span><span>  (lie  direel  advantage  to  be  derived  from</span><span>  connection  with  a  building  society.  The</span><span>  nun  in  humble  circumstances  is  en-</span><span>  couraged  to  husband  his  means,  and</span><span>  whether  he  remains  a  subscribing</span><span>  member  or  also  becomes  a  borrower,</span><span>  he  is  insured  a  rate  of  interest  on  his</span><span>  savings  which  he  cannot  hope  to  obtain</span><span>  in  any  other  way.  Tile  only  precaution</span><span>  (0  be  taken  is,  not  to  attempt  too  much.</span><span>  In  no  case  should  a  man  of  fixed  income</span><span>  so  involve  himself  that  his  monthly</span><span>  payments,  for  both  subscription  anil</span><span>  interest,  will  exceed  the  amount  of  his</span><span>  ordinary  rental  and  savings,  lt  is  true</span><span>  that  even  such  a  man  may  build  to  let</span><span>  as  well  as  to  occupy,  but  if  he</span><span>  do  so,  lie  will  enter  upon  a  speculation</span><span>  which  may  or  may  not  be  successful,</span><span>  and  he  must  accept  the  risk  of  the  trans-</span><span>  action.  Hut  in  erecting  a  house  for  his</span><span>  own  occupancy  with  the  aid  of  the</span><span>  building  society,  in  the  manner  above</span><span>  described,  it  is  clear  that  any  man  in</span><span>  steady  employment  is  making  a  prudent</span><span>  use  of  the  means  at  his  disposal.</span></p> <p><span>  Of  course  thc  success  of  building</span><span>  societies  wholly  depends  upon  their  good</span><span>  management.

Their</span><span>  report  embodies  facts  which  have  long</span><span>  been  patent,  and  which,  however  much</span><span>  to  be  deplored  by  all  humane  persons,</span><span>  will  continue  facts  until  the  aboriginal</span><span>  race  of  Australia  is  extinct.  When  we</span><span>  are  told  that  the  aborigines  are  fast</span><span>  decreasing  in  numbers,  that  they  are</span><span>  passionately  fond  of  and  easily  procure</span><span>  intoxicating  liquors,  that  disease  com-</span><span>  municated  by  intercourse  with  Europeans</span><span>  is  making  fearful  ravages  among  their</span><span>  young,  that  the  whole  race  have  an</span><span>  unconquerable  aversion  to  persistent</span><span>  labour,  and  that  little  can  be  done</span><span>  towards  ameliorating  their  condition,</span><span>  we  can  only  say  that  similar  conclusions</span><span>  have  been  arrived  at  on  several  previous</span><span>  occasions.  And  the  subsequent  recom-</span><span>  mendations  of  the  Commission  fall  upon</span><span>  the  ear  with  a  similarly  hackneyed</span><span>  sound.  The  appointment  of  protectors</span><span>  of  aborigines,  the  setting  apart  of  reserves</span><span>  for  their  exclusive  use,  thc  building  of</span><span>  huts  on  such  reserves,  the  supply  of</span><span>  implements  for  cultivating  the  soil,  of</span><span>  rations,  clothing,  and  medical  aid,-ave</span><span>  all  recommended.  And,  further,  it  is</span><span>  urged  that  special  effort  be  made  to</span><span>  improve,  educate,  and  Christianise</span><span>  the  young  by  the  establishment  of</span><span>  schools,  and  that  more  stringent</span><span>  legislation  be  enacted  with  a  view</span><span>  to  suppress  the  sale  of  intoxicating</span><span>  liquors  to  the  aborigines.  All  this  was</span><span>  recommended  and  tried  in  former  years,</span><span>  and  unhappily  with  but  very  slight  suc-</span><span>  cess.  Thc  only  result  attained  has  been</span><span>  thc  demonstration  that  the  decay  of  the</span><span>  race  may  be  temporarily  arrested,  but</span><span>  that  with  the  most  earnest  and  philan-</span><span>  thropic  efforts  ultimate  extinction  must</span></p> <p><span>  ensue.  The  fact  seems  to  be  that  these</span><span>  children  of  nature  cannot  be  civilised</span><span>  without  damage  to  their  physical  health,</span><span>  and  that  they  cannot  even  be  civilised</span><span>  without  restraint,  which  to  them  is  intol-</span><span>  erable  slavery.  The  natural  habitat  of</span><span>  the  Australian  native  is  thc  bush,  his</span><span>  only  work  is  hunting  for  his  daily  food,</span><span>  and  experience  proves  that  if  cooped</span><span>  up  and  kept  at  any  steady  occupation</span><span>  physical  deterioration  invariably  ensues.</span><span>  It  is  a  melancholy  conclusion,  but  still  a</span><span>  true  one,  that  the  aboriginal  Australian</span><span>  can  only  exist  and  flourish  in  a  savage</span><span>  state  ;  and  that  any  attempt  to  raise  his</span><span>  condition  mentally  or  morally  is  inva-</span><span>  riably  attended  by  a  lowering  of  the  vital</span><span>  force.  Under  such  circumstances,  thc</span><span>  efforts  of  good  men  to  civilise  the</span><span>  aborigines  may  be  a  labour  of  love,  but</span><span>  it  can  scarcely  be  deemed  an  encouraging</span><span>  enterprise.  And  as,  even  in  en-</span><span>  deavouring  to  spread  Christianity  it</span><span>  is  usual  to  look  for  results,  there</span><span>  is  not  much  hope  of  missions  to  the</span><span>  aborigines  being  regarded  with  much</span><span>  enthusiasm  by  the  Christian  Church.</span><span>  Tile  salvation  of  an  aboriginal  native  is</span><span>  not  of  more  importance  than  the  sal-</span><span>  vation  of  a  colonist  of  European  extrac-</span><span>  tion,  and  therefore  while  so  much</span><span>  remains  to  be  done  in  Christianising  our</span><span>  own  countrymen,  it  can  hardly  be</span><span>  expected  that  labour  will  be  uselessly</span><span>  expended  upon  a  race  whose  extinction</span><span>  may  be  postponed  but  cannot  be  averted.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  satisfactory  to  note  that  the</span><span>  Commissioner  has  found  that,  generally</span><span>  speaking,  the  aborigines  are  treated  with</span><span>  kindness  and  forbearance  by  thc  settlers</span><span>  of  the  colony,  and  that  thc  cruelty  some-</span><span>  times  practised  upon  them  is  ordinarily</span></p> <p><span>  the  result  of  their  own  misdeeds.  It  has</span><span>  generally  been  found  impracticable  to</span><span>  punish  thc  aboriginal  criminal  through</span><span>  the  ordinary  courts  of  justice,  and,</span><span>  consequently,  the  colonists  have  occa</span><span>  l  sionally  been  compelled  to  lake  thc  law</span></p> <p><span>  into  their  own  hands.  In  such  cases</span><span>  the  justice  meted  out  lias  no  doubt  been</span><span>  of  a  retributive  character,  and  the</span><span>  punishment  due  to  the  individual  lias</span><span>  been  inflicted  upon  the  tribe.  This  state</span><span>  of  affairs,  however,  results  from  tile  diffi-</span><span>  culty  of  dealing  with  a  race  of  savages</span><span>  who  respect  no  promise  and  can  be  bound</span><span>  by  no  treaty,  and  who,  in  fact,  can  only</span><span>  be  kept  from  the  perpetration  of  crime</span><span>  by  the  deterrent  element  of  fear.  In</span><span>  such  case,  the  outraged  settler  cannot  be</span><span>  blamed  if  lie  regard  the  whole  ""  myall  ""</span><span>  race  as  enemies,  to  be  treated  like  other</span><span>  noxious  animals  of  the  forest,  and  kept</span><span>  at  a  safe  distance  by  the  dread  of  powder</span></p> <p><span>  and  ball.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  no  doubt  thal  much  maudlin</span><span>  sympathy  is  wasted  upon  our  aboriginal</span><span>  neighbours.  Necessity  knows  no  law,</span><span>  and  if  the  country  is  to  be  occupied  by</span><span>  the  colonists,  the  savages  who  formerly</span><span>  possessed  it  must  be  taught  to  respect</span><span>  both  life  and  property  by  such  rough</span><span>  and  ready  methods  of  instruction  as  the</span></p> <p><span>  settler  can  command.  It  would  be  a</span></p> <p><span>  work  of  years  to  impress  upon  the  savage</span><span>  mind  the  principles  contained  in  the  ten</span><span>  commandments,  however  zealous  the</span><span>  missionary  engaged  in  that  laudable</span><span>  work.  In  the  meantime,  the  ferocious</span><span>  savage  would  remain  the  master  of  the</span><span>  situation,  and  find  the  thirst  for  blood</span><span>  cultivated  by  his  exploits,  a  sufficient</span><span>  antidote  to  the  benign  principles  of</span><span>  Christianity  inculcated  by  his  religious</span></p> <p><span>  teachers.</span></p> <p><span>  To  us  il  appears  that  there  is  only  one</span><span>  way  of  civilising  and  utilising  our  abori-</span><span>  ginal  race.  That  is,  by  a  policy  of</span><span>  isolation  and  restraint,  which  would  be,</span><span>  in  fact,  a  species  of  mild  slavery.  On</span><span>  this  point  all  English-speaking  people</span><span>  are  peculiarly  sensitive,  and  the  proba-</span><span>  bility  is  that,  of  the  two  methods  of</span><span>  dealing  with  thc  blacks,  the  existing  one</span><span>  is  really  open  to  the  least  objection.  So</span><span>  long  as  kindness  is  the  rule  and  cruelty</span><span>  the  exception,  the  policy  of  non-inter-</span><span>  ference  is  that  most  fitting  for  the</span><span>  Government  to  adopt.  Unfortunately,</span><span>  this  policy  is  not  always  practicable.</span><span>  Where  the  blacks  are  of  the  ""  myall  ""</span><span>  or  untameable  class  it  is  necessary  to</span><span>  bring  the  Native  Police  Force  into  re-</span><span>  quisition,  and  make  the  carbine  the</span><span>  great  instrument  of  civilisation.  And</span><span>  unhappily  the  employment  of  this  force</span><span>  entails  upon  the  community  some  at</span><span>  least  of  the  horrors  of  war.  The  officers</span></p> <p><span>  in  command  are  not  usually  men  of</span><span>  humane  or  otherwise  irreproachable</span><span>  character.  The  work  is  at  best  repulsive</span><span>  to  all  right-minded  persons,  and  there</span></p> <p><span>  lore,  mose  engagea  in  it  can  naraiy  ue</span><span>  expected  to  temper  mercy  with  justice.</span><span>  It  is  but  just  to  admit,  however,  thal</span><span>  there  ha  ve  been  instances  of  good  and</span><span>  humane  men  taking  charge  of  Native</span><span>  Police  troopers,  and  that  under  their</span><span>  control  thc  force  has  been  no  discredit</span><span>  to  the  colony.  But  such  cases  are  ex-</span><span>  ceptional,  and  there  can  be  no  question</span><span>  that  generally  speaking  the  ""  dispersing""</span><span>  duties  of  the  Native  Police  are  per-</span><span>  formed  willi  blood-thirsty  ferocity,  and</span><span>  therefore  we  lake  il  that  the  employment</span><span>  of  this  force  can  only  be  justified  on  the</span><span>  ground  of  necessity.

The  Assembly  lias  decided</span><span>  in  the  affirmative,  but  there  seems  little</span><span>  probability  of  the  Legislative  Council</span><span>  voting  for  its  own  extinction.  More-</span><span>  over,  some  of  the  ablest  members  of  the</span><span>  1  ,ower  House  object  to  an  elective  Upper</span><span>  House,  and  rite  the  example  of  Victoria,</span><span>  where  the  Legislative  Council,  claiming</span><span>  to  be  representatives  of  the  people,  ob-</span><span>  structed  all  legislation  for  two  years.</span><span>  Amongst  die  opponents  of  an  elective</span><span>  chamber  is  Mr.  WILLIAM  FORSTER,  the</span><span>  Colonial  Secretary  in  Sir  JAMES  MAR-</span><span>  TIN'S  late  Administration,  who  holds</span><span>  that  the  number  of  members  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  existing  Council  should  be  considerably</span><span>  increased,  and  thc  nominee  system  pre-</span><span>  served.  It  appears  from  a  recent</span><span>  debate  in  the  legislative  Assembly,  that</span><span>  although  tile  number  of  members  in  the</span><span>  Council  is  not  restricted  by  the  New</span><span>  South  Wales  Constitution  Act,  it  was</span><span>  determined  by  a  correspondence  between</span><span>  the  Secretary  of  State  and  a  former</span><span>  Governor  (Sir  JOHN  YOUNO)  that  twenty</span></p> <p><span>  seven  members  was  a  ""  convenient  ""</span><span>  number  for  the  ""  House  of  Peers,""  and</span><span>  that  unless  in  case  of  emergency  that</span><span>  number  should  not  be  exceeded,  il</span><span>  appeared  also  that  about  two  years  ago,</span><span>  a  few  days  before  Sir  JAMES  MARTIN'S</span><span>  administration  fell,  it  recommended  the</span><span>  appointment  of  two  additional  members</span><span>  to  the  Legislative  Council.  The  GOVER-</span><span>  NOR  declined  to  make  thc  appointments,</span><span>  on  various  grounds.  Amongst  these</span><span>  was  the  fact  that,  at  the  time,  the  ""  con-</span><span>  venient""  number  of  twenty-seven  had</span><span>  been  slightly  exceeded  ;  and  the  GOVER-</span><span>  NOR  was  also  influenced  by  the  consider-</span><span>  ation  that,  after  an  appeal  to  the  country,</span><span>  the  Ministry  would  in  a  few  days  en-</span><span>  counter  a  hostile  majority  in  Parliament</span><span>  -a  conclusion  fully  justified  by  subse-</span><span>  quent  events.  Mr.  FORSTER,  however,</span><span>  taking  umbrage  at  His  EXCELLENCY'S</span><span>  refusal  to  accept  advice  in  the  matter,</span><span>  resigned  his  portfolio,  and  after  two</span><span>  years'  reflection  has  introduced  thc  fol-</span><span>  lowing  motion  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""1.  That  this  House  is  of  opinion  that  any</span><span>  attempt  on  thu  part  nf  any  (lovornor  of  thin</span><span>  colony,  or  of  nny  Secretary  of  State  in  Great</span><span>  IVitain,  ivheUw.r  hy  despatches  or  instructions,</span><span>  or  otherwise,  to  interfere  with  the  appointment</span><span>  of  members  of  thc  Legislative  (Council  of  this</span><span>  colrnij',  or  on  the  part  of  any  Minister  of  tho</span><span>  Orowu  in  this  colony  to  sanction  such  inter-</span><span>  férence  so  as  in  any  way  to  limit  or  restrain</span><span>  thu  power  of  thc  líovcrmnciit  of  this  colony  in</span><span>  wich  appointment,  or  to  permanently  limit  thc</span><span>  immhcr  of  members  of  such  f-onneu,  or  ti)  con-</span><span>  fine  such  number  to  a  fixed  standard,  is  con-</span><span>  trary  to  law,  and  subversivo  of  tho  rights  and</span><span>  privileges  of  thc  I  ¡ovorimicut  and  legislature</span><span>  of  this  colony.  2.

Strange  to  say,  the  amend-</span><span>  ment  found  a  seconder,  but  no  one,</span><span>  except  the  mover,  appeared  to  possess</span><span>  audacity  enough  to  utter  a  word  in  its</span><span>  favour.  After  debate,  Mr.  PARKES,  in</span><span>  an  exhaustive  speech,  demonstrated  the</span><span>  fallacies  on  which  Mr.  FORSTER  had</span><span>  founded  In's  motion,  and  proved  that</span><span>  there  hadbeen  noimproper  interference  on</span><span>  the  part  of  the  liritish  Government  with</span><span>  the  rights  and  privileges  of  thc  colonists</span></p> <p><span>  of  New  South  Wales.</span></p> <p><span>  This  is  a  very  large  question,  and  one</span><span>  in  which  the  colonists  of  Queensland  have</span><span>  a  deep  interest.  The  GOVERNOR,  shortly</span><span>  before  the  late  Ministry  retired  from</span><span>  office,  made  several  appointments  lo  the</span><span>  Legislative  Council,  raising  the  number</span><span>  to  twenty-seven.  Hts  KXCEI.I.E.VCV  has</span><span>  since  appointed  another  member,  the</span><span>  Hon.  GEHRCK  THORN,  Postmaster-Ge-</span><span>  neral,  and  thus  lias  passed  the  limit</span><span>  deemed  in  the  mother  colony  to  ¡ie  tile</span><span>  ""  convenient""  one.  Accepting  twenty</span><span>  seven  as  the  convenient  number,  there</span><span>  does  appear  some  trudi  in  thc  accu-</span><span>  sation  that  the  late  Government  had</span><span>  crammed  the  Upper  House,  in  the</span><span>  hope  of  frustrating  the  Radical  pro-</span><span>  jects  of  their  opponents.  Our  Con-</span><span>  stitution  Act,  like  that  of  New  South</span><span>  Wales,  fixes  no  limit  to  the  number,  but</span></p> <p><span>  authorises  the  GOVERNOR  to  summon  in</span><span>  Her  Majesty's  name,  ""  under  die  Great</span><span>  ""  Seal  of  tile  said  colony,  from  lime  to</span><span>  ""  time,  to  the  Î  .egislative  Council,  such</span><span>  ""  person  or  persons  as  bc  shall  think</span><span>  ""  fit.""  ft  therefore  rests  entirely  xvidi  the</span><span>  GOVERNOR,  if  we  may  judge  by  the</span><span>  language  of  the  Act,  to  increase  the  num-</span><span>  ber  of  members  as  he  shall  think  fit,  and</span><span>  die  Ministry  for  thc  time  being  need  not</span><span>  be  consulted  in  the  maller.  Otherwise</span><span>  the  words  ""by  the  advice  of  the  Executive</span><span>  Council  ""  would  certainly  have  been</span><span>  ?  inserted.  Looked  at  in  this  light,  thc  late</span></p> <p><span>  Ministry  are  in  noway  responsible  for  the</span><span>  appointments  recently  made  to  the  Legis-</span><span>  lative  Council,  although  it  is  not  impro-</span><span>  bable  that  His  EXCKU.ENCV'S  action  has</span><span>  forwarded  the  interests  of  their  party.</span></p> <p><span>  As  yet  the  Upper  House  in  Queens-</span><span>  land  has  rarely  shown  a  disposition  to</span><span>  obstruct  salutary  reforms,  but  that</span><span>  may  have  partly  arisen  from  its  numeri-</span></p> <p><span>  cal  weakness.  Its  recent  accession  of</span><span>  strength  may  dcvclope  a  less  accommo-</span><span>  dating  spirit,  and  it  is  not  impossible</span><span>  that  the  Assembly  may  find  much  of</span><span>  their  labour  lost  through  non-compati-</span><span>  bility  with  the  upper  branch  of  the  Legis-</span><span>  lature.  In  this  state  of  affairs,  il  is</span><span>  consoling  to  know  that  the  GOVERNOR,</span><span>  in  case  of  a  deadlock,  is  entrusted  with  a</span><span>  constitutional  key  ;  and  although  il  would</span><span>  be  in  the  highest  degree  mischievous</span><span>  for  the  prerogative  of  the  Crown  to  be</span><span>  used  in  the  interest  of  any  particular</span><span>  parly,  His  EXCKIXKNCV  might  be  relied</span><span>  upon  to  interpose  did  thc  Legislative</span><span>  Council  evince  any  disposition  lo  abuse</span><span>  the  powers  and  privileges  conferred  upon</span><span>  them  by  the  Constitution  Act.  Under</span><span>  these  circumstances  it  is  very  unlikely</span><span>  that  any  measures  will  at  present  be</span><span>  taken  for  making  thc  Legislative  Council</span><span>  of  Queensland  an  elective  chamber.  We</span><span>  can,  at  any  rate,  well  afford  to  await  the</span><span>  issue  of  the  experiments  making  in  the</span><span>  two  more  advanced  colonies  of  the</span><span>  group.</span></p> <p><span>  OUR  Clermont  contemporary  of  Wed-</span><span>  nesday  last  has  a  leading  article  on  the</span><span>  shortcomings  of  the  Telegraph  Depart-</span><span>  ment  since  the  era  of  shilling  telegrams.</span><span>  Thc  public  have  borne  with  the  delays</span><span>  hitherto  in  a  most  commendable  spirit,</span><span>  bul  the  question  is  now  being  asked,</span><span>  with  some  pertinacity,  when  the  Tele-</span><span>  graph  Department  will  be  able  lo  cope</span><span>  effectively  with  the  business  (lowing  in</span><span>  upon  it  ?  So  far  the  shilling  telegrams</span><span>  have  beena  very  questionable  benefit,  on</span><span>  account  of  the  frequent  delays  in  transmis-</span><span>  sion  ;  and,  unless  the  department  intends</span><span>  to  increase  its  wires,  its  instruments,  and</span><span>  its  staff,  the  rales  had  better  revert  to  the</span><span>  old  figure.  This,  however,  is  one  of  those</span></p> <p><span>  cases  in  which  retrogression  is  im-  j</span><span>  practicable,  and  therefore  Mr.  CRACK-j</span><span>  NELL  must  be  stirred  up,  and  required</span><span>  either  lo  kee])  pace  willi  the  times  or</span></p> <p><span>  make  room  for  a  man  who  will.  Even</span><span>  with  continuous  fine  weather  the  existing</span><span>  wires  are  unable  to  carry  the  business</span><span>  thrust  upon  them,  but  when  wet  weather</span><span>  occurs  the  accumulation  of  business  at</span><span>  the  principal  offices  is  enough  to  strike</span><span>  terror  into  the  hearts  of  the  operators.  I5y</span><span>  hook  or  by  crook,  the  department</span><span>  manages  occasionally  to  get  through  its</span><span>  work,  but  if  every  case  could  be  shown</span><span>  in  which  tardiness  of  transmission</span><span>  and  interruptions  had  prevented  the</span><span>  sending  of  messages,  the  necessity</span><span>  of  greater  facilities  would  at  once  be</span><span>  apparent.  Were  prompt  replies  the  rule</span><span>  instead  of  the  exception,  il  would  be</span><span>  found  that  telegraphic  business  would</span><span>  increase  beyond  all  present  concep-</span></p> <p><span>  tions.</span></p> <p><span>  It  may  be  hoped  that  the  Ministry</span><span>  will  show  an  intelligent  appreciation  of</span><span>  thc  wants  of  the  colony  in  this  respect,</span><span>  and  that  they  will  ask  the  Legislative</span><span>  Assembly  to  make  liberal  provision  for</span><span>  extending  the  telegraphic  service,  which</span><span>  al  present  is  only  in  its  infancy.  The</span><span>  telegraph  is  of  special  advantage  in  a</span><span>  country  like  this,  where  distance  forms</span></p> <p><span>  so  serious  an  obstruction  to  business</span><span>  transactions.  We  have  no  doubt  that</span><span>  the  time  will  come  when  persons  will</span><span>  meet  by  appointment  al  telegraph</span><span>  offices  hundreds  of  miles  apart,  and</span><span>  transact  business  willi  almost  as  much</span></p> <p><span>  facility  as  though  they  were  within</span><span>  speaking  distance  of  eacli  other.  In  the</span><span>  article  published  in  yesterday's  Bulletin</span><span>  respecting  the  late  attack  upon  Harrow's</span><span>  Creek  telegraph  station,  we  were  told</span><span>  I  )r.  GOSSE,  from  the  Adelaide  telegraph</span><span>  office,  gave  full  medical  instructions  up</span><span>  to  near  the  wounded  officer's  end,  and</span><span>  that,  when  the  patient  was  getting  worse,</span><span>  his  wife  was  sent  for  by  Mr.  Tomi,  and</span><span>  conversed  with  her  fast-sinking  husband</span><span>  by  wire-a  melancholy  pleasure,  no</span><span>  doubt,  but  still  one  whose  value</span><span>  cannot  be  estimated  in  money.  Thc</span><span>  one  essential  advantage  of  telegraphs</span><span>  over  all  other  means  of  communication</span><span>  is,  their  instantaneous  operation,  and</span><span>  therefore  the  greater  average  celerity  in</span><span>  the  transmission  of  messages  the  greater</span><span>  advantage  to  thc  public.  This  is  a</span><span>  matter  in  which  every  colonist  has  a</span><span>  deep  interest,  and  therefore  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  may  propose  a  liberal  expenditure</span><span>  upon  it  without  laying  themselves  open</span><span>  to  a  charge  of  extravagance,  or  of  favour-</span><span>  ing  one  part  of  thc  colony  at  the  expense</span><span>  of  another,  livery  additional  hundred</span><span>  miles  of  wire  confers  fresh  benefit  upon</span><span>  the  whole  colony,  and  indeed  upon  the</span><span>  whole  of  Australia,  and  therefore  tele-</span><span>  graph  construction  may  very  properly</span><span>  lie  regarded  as  a  cosmopolitan  work.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  tho  Police  Court  yesterday  morning,</span><span>  before  thc  Police  Magistrate,  four  drunkards</span><span>  were  admonished  and  discharged.</span></p> <p><span>  WITH  regard  to  thc  imniiry  into  the  circum-</span><span>  stances  attending  the  late  accident  to  the</span><span>  James  Paterson,  s.s.,  wc  understand  Hint  tho</span><span>  evidence  points  to  thc  conclusion  that  neither</span><span>  tho  intricacies  of  the  channel  nor  the  st:ite  of</span><span>  the  weather  are  chargeable  with  the  respon-</span><span>  sibility  of  tli.it  disaster.  1  f  this  be  so,  it  may</span><span>  bc  hoped  that  neither  thc  Marine  Board  nor</span><span>  thc  A.S.N.

A  few  days  since  we  I</span></p> <p><span>  were  told  that  an  offer  to  allow  the  j</span><span>  steamers  lo  call  at  Port  Darwin  was  ¡</span><span>  in  consideration  by  the  South  Aus-</span><span>  tralian  Government,  and  it  is  even</span><span>  yet  possible  that  the  proposal  will  be</span><span>  accepted.  Hut  with  thal  we  have</span><span>  comparatively  small  concern,  for  however</span><span>  desirable  it  may  be  to  conned  Port</span><span>  Darwin  and  the  northern  settlements</span><span>  of  Queensland,  the  boats  calling  al</span><span>  Palmerston  would  involve  some  delay</span><span>  in  thc  usual  service,  which  might</span><span>  much  abridge  its  utility....  J)jlt.""irJ}^</span><span>  and  Melbourne  on  the  other,  is  a  very</span><span>  different  matter.  Wc  shall  bc  thus</span><span>  brought  into  direct  communication  with</span><span>  China,  not  only  without  the  detention  of</span><span>  our  homeward-bound  mails,  but  under</span><span>  circumstances  which  make  il  probable</span><span>  that  their  transmission  will  be  accelerated.</span><span>  As  we  understand  the  telegram,  Singa-</span><span>  pore  will  lie  the  Company's  central  port</span><span>  in  the  Haslem  seas,  the  mails  being</span><span>  conveyed  thence,  north-easterly  to  China</span><span>  on  the  one  band,  and  south-easterly  to</span><span>  Australia  on  the  other.  Starling  from</span><span>  Melbourne,  the  calling-places  of  the</span><span>  steamers  will  probably  be  Port  Jackson,</span><span>  Moreton  Hay,  Keppel  Hay,  Port</span><span>  Denison,  Rockingham  Hay,  Cape</span><span>  York,  Java,  and  Singapore.  Thc</span><span>  homeward  Australian  mail  will  be  there</span><span>  Iranshipped,  and  after  taking  on  board</span><span>  the  China  outward  mails,  the  Australian</span><span>  boat  will  continue  her  voyage  to  Hong</span><span>  Kong,  reluming  thence  with  the  home-</span><span>  ward  mail  in  lime  to  catch  the  next  out-</span><span>  ward  Australian  mail  at  Singapore.  The</span><span>  steamer  will  -then  start  for  Melbourne  via</span><span>  Java  and  Queensland.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  already  considerable  trade:</span><span>  between  Melbourne  and  China,  and  thc</span><span>  probability  is  that  finding  less  encourage</span><span>  ment  than  was  expected  at  Sydney,  thc</span><span>  Company  have  determined  to  cater  foi</span><span>  the  Melbourne  and  China  trade.

Some  month:</span><span>  since  lhere  was  a  half-promise  given  tc</span><span>  1  thc  Queensland  Government  by  Mr</span></p> <p><span>  PARKKS,  of  an  annual  contribution  ofter</span><span>  thousand  pounds  sterling  towards  the  neu</span><span>  service.

It  is  now  very</span><span>  near  completion,  and  the  city  lins  a</span><span>  liability  of  ¿142,000  on  account  of  the</span><span>  structure.  The  cost  of  the  work  is</span></p> <p><span>  wholly  beyond  the  means  of  the  eily,</span><span>  and  already  some  ,£20,000  of  the  ordi-</span><span>  nary  revenue  of  the  Council  has  been</span><span>  swallowed  up  in  interest  upon  the  out-</span><span>  lay.  This  amount  the  Corporation</span><span>  could  ill  afford  lo  lose,  and  the  conse-</span><span>  quences  ave  but  too  apparent  in  ihe</span><span>  wretched  condition  of  Ihe  city  streets.</span><span>  Beyond  Queen-street,  go  where  you  will,</span><span>  there  is  not  a  street  even  in  a  passable</span><span>  stale  of  repair,  nnJ  probably  in  no</span><span>  town  in  the  colony  is  so  little  «lone</span><span>  in  comparison  with  thc  amount  annually</span><span>  extracted  from  the  ratepayers.  Tliis  is</span><span>  anything  but  creditable  to  the  metropolis</span><span>  of  the  colony,  for  if  local  self-government</span><span>  have  a  much  better  chance  of  success</span></p> <p><span>  in  one  place  than  in  any  other,  that</span><span>  place  should  be  at  the  seal  of  govern-</span><span>  ment.

At  one  lime,  when  the</span><span>  city  finances  were  buoyant,  thc</span><span>  periodical  social  gatherings,  irreverently</span><span>  termed  ""quarterly  feeds,""  possibly</span><span>  sustained  Ihe  patriotic  spirit  of</span><span>  the  Corporation,  but  since  pressure  of</span><span>  interest  was  brought  to  bear  these  delec-</span><span>  tations  were  of  necessity  abandoned,  and</span><span>  aspiring  aldermen  found  their  sphere</span><span>  limited  to  the  more  prosaic  work  offilling</span><span>  impassable  ditches,  cutting  away  imprac-</span><span>  ticable  ridges,  and  so  financing  as  to</span><span>  stave  off  the  evil  day  until  a.  pitying</span><span>  Legislature  should  fly  to  their  relief,  lt</span><span>  was  under  these  circumstances  thal</span><span>  ""  Ichabod""  was  written  on  the  Town</span><span>  Hall,  and  that  the  city  was  handed  over</span><span>  to  the  tender  mercies  of  men  who,  with</span><span>  some  bright  exceptions,  were  totally  un-</span><span>  fit  to  bc  entrusted  with  the  transaction</span><span>  of  public  business.</span></p> <p><span>  It  will  be  observed  that  our  telegram</span><span>  gives  no  hint  of  the  reception  accorded</span><span>  to  the  aldermen  when  they  repre-</span><span>  sented  their  case  to  thc  Govern-</span><span>  ment.  We  arc  not  told  whether  the</span><span>  request  was  made  by  deputation  or  by</span><span>  letter,  but  it  may  be  pretty  safely  inferred</span><span>  that  no  tangible  result  has  been  yet</span><span>  attained.  The  Government  appear  un-</span><span>  willing  to  incur  thc  responsibility  of  a</span><span>  general  bridge  scheme,  awl  will,  in  all</span><span>  probability,  leave  it  an  open  «¡uestion.</span><span>  If  introduced  at  al),  Ihe  subject  will  be</span><span>  myst  likely  brought  forward  by  some</span><span>  privait;  iiK-mbcr,  in  which  case  the  Cabi-</span><span>  ns  »nay  i.-ilhcT  be  expected  lo  «livide  on</span><span>  thc  ipwiiti'in,  tn  to  recommend  its  refer-</span><span>  ent  fi  a  Seli;«;t  (  :&lt;nnmiltec.

Still  less</span><span>  likely  is  it  that  .my  proposal  lo  deal  witli</span><span>  the  Brisbane  bridge  alone  will  meet  willi</span><span>  acceptance,  even  if  it  be  backed  up  willi</span><span>  i  all  the  strength  of  thc  Jirisbanc  and</span></p> <p><span>  Moreton  district  members.</span></p> <p><span>  As  already  slated  in  this  column,  wc</span><span>  think  great  works  like  these  should  either</span><span>  be  made  a  charge  upon  thc  districts</span><span>  benefiting  hy  them,  ¡or  a  loll  should  be</span><span>  imposed  for  the  security  of  Ute  general</span><span>  revenue.  They  should  not  be  under-</span><span>  taken  unless  pretty  good  evidence  is  pro-</span><span>  curable  that,  either  directly  or  indirectly,</span><span>  the  expenditure  will  be  fully  reproduc-</span><span>  tive.  U'e  cannot  allow  that  any  bridge</span><span>  yet  erected  or  proposed  in  this  colony</span><span>  is  a  national  work,  and  therefore  it</span><span>  should  not  be  pennitled  to  burden  thc</span><span>  national  finances.  At  the  same  time,</span><span>  the  national  credit  »ny  fairly  he  sought</span><span>  in  its  behalf,  just  as  in  the  case  of</span><span>  loans  (o  municipalities  such  bodies  arc</span><span>  enabled  to  carry  out  local  works  by</span><span>  giving  security  over  the  local  revenues,</span><span>  j  We  know  it  is  too  common  for  muni</span></p> <p><span>  I  cipal  councils  to  repudiate  their  liabilities</span><span>  j  to  the  General  Government,  hut  the</span></p> <p><span>  laxity  complained  of  is  due  to  moral</span></p> <p><span>  I  weakness  in  both  parties  to  the  transac-</span></p> <p><span>  tion.  There  is  no  doubt  that  if  the</span></p> <p><span>  Executive  in  such  cases  insisted  upon</span><span>  municipalities  adhering  strictly  to  their</span><span>  engagements,  while  evincing  the  dispo-</span><span>  sition  to  accord  llieni  all  reasonable  help,</span><span>  the  public  revenue  would  be  amply  pro</span><span>  I  tecled,  and  the  loan  principle  found  of</span><span>  I  much  advantage  lo  local  bodies,</span></p> <p><span>  ll  is  folly  to  contend  that  because</span><span>  the  (  iovenuncnt  do  not  choose  to  enforce</span><span>  payment  of  municipal  loans,  the</span><span>  ratepayers  of  the  colony  should  he</span><span>  driven  to  accept  the  hard  terms  imposed</span><span>  by  the  private  money-lender,  or  confine</span><span>  their  jil  ans  of  improvement  strictly</span><span>  within  thc  limits  of  ordinary  revenue.</span></p> <p><span>  lt  must  he  admitted  that  the  example</span><span>  set  by  lirisbanc  in  clamouring  for  a  free</span><span>  bridge  is  not  encouraging.  That  bridge</span><span>  is  no  more  a  national  work  than  a  bridge</span><span>  would  he  over  any  other  river  in  the</span><span>  colony.  And  thc  claim  for  exceptional</span><span>  treatment  on  the  ground  of  surrendered</span><span>  bridge  lands  cannot  be  deemed  valid,</span><span>  lirisbanc  had  no  better  right  to  a  bridge</span><span>  land-grant  than  can  bc  shown  by  several</span><span>  other  towns  in  ihe'colony,  and  therefore  if</span><span>  a  free  bridge  be  granted  to  Brisbane,</span><span>  Maryborough,  Rockli.ampton,and  Mackay</span><span>  will  be  entitled  to  a  similar  concession.</span><span>  We  cannot  for  a  moment  allow  that</span><span>  Jlrjsbane  is  entitled  lo  consideration  on</span><span>  the  ground  that  it  is  the  seat  of  Govern-</span></p> <p><span>  ment.  That  doctrine  is  now  obsolete  in  !</span><span>  Queensland,  and,  we  arc  persuaded,  will  i</span><span>  never  he  endorsed  by  Parliament,  now  j</span><span>  that  redistribution  has  given  lo  all  paris  j</span><span>  of  the  colony  their  due  share  of  influence</span></p> <p><span>  in  the  Legislature.  j</span></p> <p><span>  it  must  be  understood  that  wc  have</span></p> <p><span>  no  objection  to  free  bridges,  as  such.</span><span>  Tolls  of  all  kinds  are  an  abomination,</span><span>  and  might  he  wholly  dispensed  with  were</span><span>  a  statutory  distinction  drawn  between</span><span>  local  and  general  works.  But  so  long</span><span>  as  thc  general  revenue  is  held</span><span>  liable  for  purely  local  works,</span><span>  security  for  their  cost  must  be</span><span>  exacted  in  the  form  of  tolls.  If</span><span>  our  lirisbanc  friends  would  submit  to</span></p> <p><span>  this  principle  for  the  time  being,  and</span><span>  give  their  aid  towards  establishing  a</span><span>  system  of  local  government  adapted  to</span><span>  the  peculiar  circumstances  of  the  colony,</span><span>  they  might  soon  realise  their  ideal  of  a</span><span>  free  bridge.  The  burden  of  ils  cost  is</span><span>  crushing  to  the  city,  but  to  thc  whole</span><span>  Moreton  district  it  would  involve  no</span><span>  appreciable  increase  of  taxation,  espe-</span><span>  cially  when  the  Legislature  had  voted</span><span>  the  compensation  equitably  due  lo  the</span><span>  municipal  revenues  for  unwarrantable</span><span>  interference  with  the  bridge  contract  in</span><span>  bygone  years.</span></p> <p><span>  In  conclusion,  it  must  be  remarked  thal</span><span>  the  country  constituencies  have  no  wish</span><span>  lo  &lt;piarrel  with  the  metropolitans  over</span><span>  the  amount  represented  by  the  cost  of</span><span>  the  lirisbanc  bridge.  Their  determina-</span><span>  tion,  so  far  as  we  understand  it,  is  simply</span><span>  lo  insist  that  works  conferring  purely</span><span>  local  advantages  shall  not  bc  carried  on</span><span>  at  the  cost  of  the  whole  colony.</span></p> ",Article,1874-03-20,"The Rockhampton Bulletin, WITH WHICH IS INCORPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER.

Instead  of  finding  the  depart-</span><span>  ments  so  many  Augean  stables,  recking</span><span>  willi  corruption,  every  govern  nient</span><span>  establishment  is  found  swept  anti  gar</span><span>  nished,  and  the  foaming  patriot,</span><span>  once  safely  ensconced  amidst  paper;</span><span>  and  red  tape,  quickly  acquires  thc</span><span>  bland  and  dignified  demeanour  of  :</span><span>  Minister  of  the  Crown.  He  finds  him</span><span>  self  by  no  means  an  autocrat  in  his  nev</span><span>  sphere,  and  lo  a  greater  extent  thai</span><span>  bc  had  ever  before  suspected,  he  mus</span><span>  be  guided  by  Iiis  Under-Secrelary  ant</span><span>  departmental  usage.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  thus  that  the  MACAU  srrci</span><span>  Ministry,  who  represent  the  Kadica</span><span>  reformers  in  thc  House,  have  appcaro</span><span>  to  so  little  advantage  within  the  last  tia</span><span>  or  two.  After  two  months'  deliberador</span></p> <p><span>  it  has  been  found  that  thc  policy  of  thc</span><span>  gentlemen  who  were  alleged  to  have</span><span>  unconstitutionally  and  violently  held  the</span><span>  reins  of  Government  for  a  period  of  four</span><span>  years,  is  the  policy  required  by  the</span><span>  colony,  and  that  it  cannot  be  improved</span><span>  upon.  Beyond  the  intimation  that  the</span><span>  ten  years'  leases  arc  lo  be  dealt  with</span><span>  more  liberally  than  the  existing  law</span><span>  allows,  and  that  the  Payment  of  Mem-</span><span>  bers  Hill  will  be  made  a  Government</span><span>  measure,  there  is  no  variation  in</span><span>  Mr.  MACALISTEK'S  programme  from  that</span><span>  with  which  the  session  was  opened  by</span><span>  his  opponent.  This  should  be  very</span><span>  gratifying  lo  Mr.  PAI.MKK,  and  prove</span><span>  to  the  public  thal  whether  the  Minis-</span><span>  terial  Benches  be  occupied  by  Conserva-</span><span>  tives  or  Liberals,  under  vigorous</span><span>  parliamentary  government  the  policy  of</span><span>  the  Ministry  must  be  in  accordance  with</span><span>  thc  will  of  the  people.</span></p> <p><span>  Wc  are  told  that  the  Budget  will  be</span><span>  presented  next  Wednesday,  and  possibly</span><span>  in  this  the  difference  ""  'Twixt  Tweedle-</span><span>  dum  and  Tweedledee""  will  become</span><span>  manifest.  The  late  Ministry's  estimates</span><span>  provided  for  a  general  advance  upon  all</span><span>  salaries,  and  the  new  ones,  we  are  told,</span><span>  will  be  prepared  on  the  strictest  princi-</span><span>  ples  of  economy.  In  the  end,  however,</span><span>  we  apprehend  the  result  will  not  be</span><span>  affected.  The  purchasing  value  of  tile</span><span>  sovereign  has  been  decreasing  for  years</span><span>  I  past,  and  the  expenditure  of  the  colony</span><span>  will  no  doubt  be  proportionately  in-</span><span>  creased.  This  is  really  a  matter  very</span><span>  much  beyond  thc  control  of  Ministers,</span><span>  for,  so  far  as  the  Civil  Service  is  con-</span><span>  cerned,  inadequate  salaries  aie  the  sure</span><span>  precursor  of  corruption  and  inefficiency.</span></p> <p><span>  In  other  matters  the  financial  policy  of</span><span>  of  the  Ministry  is  likely  to  differ  but</span><span>  slightly  from  that  of  their  predecessors.</span></p> <p><span>  There  may  bc  an  increased  tendency  to.</span><span>  cany  on  public  works,  and  swell  ihe</span><span>  debt  of  the  colony,  but  that  disposition</span><span>  even  thc  late  Ministry  would  have  been</span><span>  compelled  lo  show.  The  railways  must</span><span>  be  pushed  on,  and  the  progress  of  the</span><span>  country  assisted  in  every  practicable</span><span>  way.  With  the  immensity  of  our</span><span>  known  resources,  and  the  ex-</span><span>  ample  of  other  colonies  before  us,</span><span>  it  cannot  be  argued  thal  we  have  reached</span><span>  the  limit  at  which  indebtedness  is  likely</span></p> <p><span>  to  become  unsafe  or  burdensome.  In</span></p> <p><span>  judiciously  constructed  railways  llie</span><span>  colony  will  have  so  valuable  an  asset  for</span><span>  its  loan  expenditure,  that  there  is  still</span><span>  room  for  much  expansion  in  this  direc-</span><span>  tion.  We  shall,  therefore,  be  quite  pre-</span><span>  pared  to  leam  that  the  Budget  includes</span><span>  proposals  for  further  extensive  loans  for</span><span>  necessary  public  works.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  PALMER  has  just  given  a  new</span><span>  pledge  of  his  sincerity  on  the  Education</span><span>  question,  by  introducing  what  our  tele-</span><span>  graphic  correspondent  calls  a  ""  Com-</span><span>  pulsory  Education  Bill.""  His  last</span><span>  bill  contained  a  compulsory  provision,</span><span>  and  the  probability  is  that  it  will</span><span>  prove  to  be  the  same  as  the  one  referred</span><span>  to.  We  can  hardly  believe  that  thc</span><span>  hon.  gentleman  intends  to  introduce</span><span>  a  measure  dealing  with  compulsory</span><span>  education  alone,  for  other  changes  of</span><span>  even  greater  importance  are  necessary.</span><span>  Mr.  PALMER  stands  on  firm  ground  on</span><span>  this  question,  for  he  is  very  nearly</span></p> <p><span>  abreast  with  the  most  advanced  re-</span></p> <p><span>  formers  of  thc  day,  while  it  is  notorious</span><span>  that  education  is  a  weak  point  with  Hie</span><span>  prescnl  Ministry.  Mr.  MACALISTER  has</span><span>  lost  caste  by  courting  the  denomina</span><span>  tionalists,  and  Mr.  M'DF.VITT'S  associa-</span><span>  tions  necessarily  place  him  in  the  rear-</span><span>  guard  amongst  educational  reformers.</span><span>  So  that  Mr.  PALMER  has  a  good  oppor-</span><span>  tunity  of  proving  that  on  one  of  thc  most</span><span>  important  questions  of  thc  day,  the</span></p> <p><span>  leader  of  the  Government  docs  not  re-</span></p> <p><span>  present  the  paramount  opinion  of  the</span><span>  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  Until  next  week,  when  thc  complete</span><span>  policy  of  the  Government  will  be  placed</span><span>  before  the  country,  it  is  almost  prema-</span><span>  ture  to  hazard  an  opinion  upon  thc</span><span>  prospects  of  thc  Session.  But  so  far</span><span>  as  present  indications  go,  there  does</span><span>  seem  ground  lo  hope  that  the  new</span><span>  House  will  prove  itself  worthy  of</span><span>  the  respect  and  confidence  of  the</span><span>  colon}'.</span></p> <p><span>  KVKBVOKE  who  desires  to  sec  the  members</span></p> <p><span>  of  thc  legal  profession  enjoy  tho  respect  and</span><span>  confidence  of  their  clients  and  tho  public,  will</span><span>  rejoice  to  observe  that  at  length  thc  Judges</span><span>  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  tho  hw  Society  at</span><span>  Brisbane,  have  marie  au  example  of  one  prac-</span><span>  titioner  wlii>  has  boen  fourni  guilty  "">f  unpm</span><span>  fcssiimal  conduct.

The  writer-for</span><span>  Vice-regal  speeches  aro  written  before,</span><span>  instead  of  after,  delivery-seems  to  have</span><span>  been  sorely  exercised  to  find  staple  for</span><span>  his  product  Ex  nihilo  nihil  fit,  says  the</span><span>  proverb.  But  in  these  days  an  author  is</span><span>  worth  little  who  cannot  make  bricks</span><span>  without  straw.  We  must,  however,  con-</span><span>  gratulate  the  ministerial  speech-maker  in</span><span>  this  case.  He  has  given  the  public,  at</span><span>  least  enough  for  its  money.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Government,  through  His  EXCEL-</span><span>  LENCE  begin  by  expressing  pleasure  at</span><span>  being  able  to  give  honorable  members</span><span>  their  dismissal,  m  which  we  credit-them</span><span>  with  bein¿  perfectly  ingenuous.  The</span><span>  same  may  be  said  of  the  apology  which</span><span>  follows  for  the  crudeness  of  the  bills</span><span>  introduced.  Ministers  ""  had  but  limited</span><span>  ""  time  at  their  disposal  for  the  preparation</span><span>  ""  of  measures  previous  to  placing  them</span><span>  ""  before  Parliament.""  The  members  of</span><span>  the  Opposition,  and  of  the  Legislative</span><span>  Council,  should  really  feel  grateful  for</span><span>  this  practical  confession  that  thc  mis-</span><span>  carriage  of  Ministerial  measures  was  due  to</span><span>  their  own  inefficacy  rather  than  to  a  blind</span><span>  spirit  of  resistance  to  judicious  reform.</span><span>  And  it  is  also  refreshing  to  learn  that  the</span><span>  bills  passed-upon  which  his  EXCEL-</span><span>  LENCY'S  advisers  presumedly  staked  their</span><span>  existence-arc  not  of  ,an  unimportant</span><span>  character.  We  should  be  sorry  to</span><span>  believe  that  Ministers  would  risk  a  crisis</span><span>  for  the  sake  of  passing  an  unimportant</span><span>  measure.

There  is</span><span>  probably  some  real  ground  for  this</span><span>  general  conclusion.  It  has  long  been</span><span>  suspected  that  the  MINISTER  FOR  WORKS</span><span>  has  never  worked  harmoniously  with  all</span><span>  his  colleagues,  or,  if  he  have,  there  has</span><span>  been  often  a  divergence  of  opinion  which</span><span>  must  have  proved  destructive  of  sym-</span><span>  pathetic  action.  The  Ministry  have</span><span>  pulled  together  to  keep  the  State  coach</span><span>  m  motion,  simply  because  any  other</span><span>  course  would  have  immediately  closed</span><span>  their  career.  Bat,  if  there  were  differ-</span><span>  ences  of  opinion  on  Legislative  questions,</span><span>  there  are,  if  rumour  be  credited,  still</span><span>  more  serious  differences  on  matters  oi</span><span>  administration.  Mr.  M'ILWRAITH  is  a</span><span>  shrewd,  far-seeing,  and  experienced  man,</span><span>  .with  a  strong  tendency  to  stubbornness,</span><span>  and  in  the  early  days  of  the  Ministry</span><span>  the  public  were  shown  that  when  thc</span><span>  MINISTER  FOR  WORKS  ""put  his  foot</span><span>  down,""  it  was.  useless  for  his  chief  to  pro-</span><span>  test.  In  bis  first  effusive  speech  to  the</span><span>  I  pswichians,  Mr.  MACALISTER  announced</span><span>  thiat  he  would  have  the  Brisbane  Railway</span><span>  Terminus  brought  into  a  more  central</span><span>  position  than  had  been  selected  by  the</span><span>  late  Ministry  in""  the  Grammar  School</span><span>  Reserve.  Mr.  M'ILWRAITH,  however,</span><span>  declined  to  endorse  this  bid  for  popu</span><span>  laxity,  and  most  distinctly  said  the</span><span>  tennînus  site  should  not  be  changed.</span><span>  About  the  same  time,  it  will  be  recol-</span><span>  lected,  there  were  other  differences  ol</span><span>  opinion  in  which  the  PREMIER  wai</span><span>  obliged  to  give  way  to  his  immovable</span><span>  colleague,  and  one,  too,  be  it  remembered</span><span>  whom  he  had  detached  from  the  part)</span><span>  supporting  the  late  Ministry.  At  the</span><span>  time  of  the  discussion  of  Mr.  FITZ</span><span>  GERALD'S  coolie  labour  motion,  it  wa;</span><span>  ""  well  known  that  Mr.  M'ILWRAITI</span></p> <p><span>  was  favourable  to  coolie  immigration</span><span>  and  hence  the  electrical  effect  produced</span><span>  upon  tile  House  when  the  PREMIER</span><span>  declared  that  if  either  of  his  colleague:</span><span>  voted  for  the  motion  he  would  not  rcmair</span><span>  a  Minister  after  the  next  morning.  Wi</span><span>  believe  Mr.  M'ILWRAITH  was  not  ii</span><span>  the  chamber  at  the  moment,  or  he</span><span>  would  have  scarcely  sat  like  a  ""  duml</span><span>  dog""  under  such  an  announcement</span><span>  and  that  he  made  no  subsequent  sign  wa1</span><span>  considered  a  matter  of  suqjrise.  It</span><span>  probability  however,  is,  that  as  the  thr  .</span><span>  was  not  reported,  Mr.  M'IIAVR*  J-I</span><span>  thought  it  wise  to  pocket  the  aff  for</span><span>  But  such  occurrences,  though  lempr  ITar\</span><span>  veiled,  are  not  forgotten,  but  are  tre  asun</span><span>  up  against  the  day  of  reckoning  wh¡,</span><span>  must  surely  come.  Since  the  pro  ,x>gatio</span><span>  also,  there  have  been  fresh  ind-'  ,cations</span><span>  disagreement,  and  it  can  hardly  1</span><span>  concluded  that  all  the  .'/ppointmen</span><span>  made  have  met  Mr.  ""M'ILWRAITI</span><span>  approval,  some  of  thr;Tri  too  sure</span><span>  smacking  of  nepotism  «  0  satisfy  so  rig</span><span>  an  economist  as  the  MINISTER  M</span><span>  WORKS.  Again,  thr;  PREMIER  durii</span><span>  his  tour  northwards  seems  to  have  bo</span><span>  particularly  liberal  hi  promises  relali;</span><span>  to  matters  within,  the  province  of  t</span><span>  Works  Departui  ent.  At  Bundaberg  ai</span><span>  Mackay  he  s  ^oke  apparently  as  t</span><span>  mouth-piece  of  the  whole  cabinet</span></p> <p><span>  regard  to  Expenditure  on  public  wor]</span><span>  The  surveys  of  the  projected  rail  or  tn</span><span>  way  frorr.t  lUmdaberg  to  Mount  Pei</span><span>  should  bc  al  once  commenced,  and</span><span>  was  surprised  that  they  had  not  bc</span><span>  already  started.  He  promised  to  reco</span></p> <p><span>  mend  an  additional  ^4000  loan  to  the  |</span></p> <p><span>  the  Municipal  Council  at  Mackay,  and  '</span><span>  to  provide  for  the  erection  of  an  immigra-  1</span><span>  tion  depot  and  a  post  office.  The  local  1</span><span>  journal  also  states  that  before  thc</span></p> <p><span>  lion,  gentleman's  departure  he  ""  caused  1</span><span>  instructions  to  be  sent  to  the  department  '</span><span>  of  public  works  to  have  plans  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  immigration  depot  and  lock-up  prepared.""  1</span><span>  These  buildings  are  no  doubt  for  the  (</span><span>  Colonial  Secretary's  own  department,  '</span><span>  but  they  will  involve  a  considerable  ex-  '</span><span>  penditure  which,  it  may  be  presumed,  j</span></p> <p><span>  will  need  the  consent  of  the  Premier's</span><span>  colleagues.  As  to  the  Mount  Perry</span><span>  tramway,  we'  can  hardly  suppose  that</span><span>  Mr.  M'ILWRAITH  has  any  serious  in</span><span>  tention  of  undertaking  that  work,  for  he</span><span>  is  known  to  be  an  opponent  of  tram-</span></p> <p><span>  ways,  and  is  not  likely  to  change  his  ,</span><span>  mind  because  the  PREMIER  has  approved  ,</span><span>  of  the  tramway  constructed  by  Mr.</span><span>  Tooth,  at  a  cost  of  ¿£700  per  mile.</span></p> <p><span>  Of  course  while  Ministers  are  tra-  ,</span><span>  veiling  about  the  country,  we  are  not</span><span>  likely  to  hear  of  resignations,  nor  even</span><span>  when  they  all  return  to  Brisbane  is  there</span><span>  likely  to  be  any  decided  action  for  some</span><span>  months  to  come.

When  thc</span><span>  Parliament  met  on  tile  25th  March,  there</span><span>  were  two  sets  of  Estimates  to  pass,  and</span><span>  quite  an  array  of  measures  on  which  we</span><span>  were  assured  that  legislation  was  impe-</span><span>  ratively  demanded.  Since  then  the</span><span>  Assembly  has  sat  scarcely  more  than</span><span>  three  months  when  on  Thursday  week</span><span>  the  business  paper  was  almost  cleared</span><span>  both  of  Government  and  private  matters,</span><span>  and  the  representatives  of  the  people</span><span>  were  doing  little  more  than  awaiting  the</span><span>  pleasure  of  the  honourable  gentlemen  of</span><span>  tlie  Upper  House.  The  newspapers</span><span>  have  told  us  repeatedly  during  the  session</span><span>  that  no  work  was  being  done,  and  that</span><span>  time  was  being  constantly  wasted  in  vapid</span><span>  discussion.  There  is  unfortunately  too</span><span>  too  much  truth  in  this  remark,  but  it  is</span><span>  not  entirely  true  notwithstanding.  Con-</span><span>  sidering  that  more  than  one-half  of  the</span><span>  representative  chamber  consisted  of  en-</span><span>  tirely  new  men,  that  a  majority  of  Minis-</span><span>  ters  had  never  previously  held  a  portfolio,</span><span>  and  that  a  great  infusion  of  new  blood</span><span>  had  taken  place  into  the  Legislative</span><span>  Council,  we  think  the  quantity  of  busi-</span><span>  ness  transacted  has  been  considerable,</span></p> <p><span>  ana  will  compare  favourably  with  most</span><span>  previous  sessions.  When  we  recollect</span><span>  how  year  after  year  all  legislation  was</span><span>  stopped  by  deadlocks,  and  how  tile  little</span><span>  work  done  went  through  with  a  run,  the</span><span>  course  of  business  this  year  has  been</span></p> <p><span>  marked  by  a  very  perceptible  change  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  better.</span></p> <p><span>  The  country,  however,  is  not  so  much</span><span>  1  indebted  to  Ministers  for  this  condition</span><span>  !  of  aiTairs,  the  good  sense  and  forbear-</span><span>  ance  of  the  Opposition  having  been  the</span><span>  real  cause  of  improvement.  Of  party</span><span>  obstruction,  such  as  the  public  were1</span><span>  accustomed  to  when  thc  Great  Liberals</span><span>  occupied  Hie  Opposition  benches,  there</span><span>  has  been  absolutely  none,  and  for  the</span><span>  little  obstruction  that  has  occurred  the</span><span>  so-called  independent  members  on  both</span><span>  sides  are  solely  responsible.  On  the</span><span>  one  hand  a  few  ultra  conservatives  have</span><span>  considered  it  their  duty  to  talk</span><span>  against  time,  and  on  the  other  the</span><span>  radicals  at  the  back  of  Ministers  have</span><span>  occasionally  resorted  to  this  extreme  ex-</span><span>  pedient  of  raising  up  a  barrier  against</span><span>  ^progress.  But  in  every  case  these</span></p> <p><span>  proceedings  have  been  resisted  by  the</span><span>  leaders  of  the  House,  and  deplored</span><span>  by  all  moderate  men,  who  desire  to  see</span><span>  every  measure  fairly  and  intelligently,</span><span>  but  not  tediously,  discussed.  It  is  well</span><span>  understood  in  this  colony  that  honorable</span><span>  members  will  only  devote  a  certain  por-</span><span>  tion  of  their  time  to  Parliamentary  duties,</span><span>  and  that  if  discussion  on  some  subjects</span><span>  be  unduly  protracted  it  will  be  propor</span><span>  tionably  curtailed  in  others.  And  this</span><span>  remark  applies  to  all  legislative  bodies,</span><span>  for  we  find  that  the  mischievous  practice</span><span>  of  rushing  through  business  without  dis-</span><span>  cussion  is  even  more  complained  of  in</span><span>  New  South  Wales  than  here.  The  Par-</span><span>  liament  has  just  risen  at  Sydney,  after  an</span><span>  unconscionable  session  of  ten  months,</span><span>  and  after  interminable  floods  of  talk,</span><span>  with  thc  major  portion  of  its  business</span><span>  still  untransacted,  no  less  titan  thirty</span><span>  one  orders  of  the  day,  we  learn,</span><span>  remained  on  the  business  paper  when  Sir</span><span>  HERCULES  ROMNSON  thanked  honorable</span></p> <p><span>  members  and  dispersed  them  to  their</span><span>  homes.  The  result  of  such  a  stoppage</span><span>  of  legislation  must  be  deplorable.  None</span><span>  of  the  actual  business  of  the  year  has  yet</span><span>  been  done,  and  in  consequence  Parlia-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  must  re-assemble  after  a  brief  recess</span><span>  of  scarcely  two  months.  Whatever</span><span>  ground  of  complaint  we  may  have  in</span><span>  Queensland,  therefore,  our  case  is  cer-</span><span>  tainly  more  satisfactory  than  that  of  the</span><span>  parent  colony.  Our  Parliament  will  be</span><span>  prorogued  in  the  course  of  two  or  three</span><span>  days,  and  the  Government,  rejoicing  in</span><span>  twelve  months'  supply  in  advance,</span><span>  will  have  abundant  time  during</span><span>  the  recess  to  attend  to  administrative</span><span>  duties,  which  are,  in  fact,  of  no  less</span><span>  importance  than  legislation.  Whatever</span><span>  laws  we  may  be  .endowed  with,  in  the</span><span>  absence  of  vigorous  administration,  the</span><span>  public  will  reap  no  benefit  It  is  there-</span><span>  fore  matter  for  solid  satisfaction  that  the</span><span>  state  of  the  public  business  admits  of  so</span><span>  early  a  cessation  of  parliamemtary</span></p> <p><span>  labours.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  scarcely  less  a  subject  for  satis-</span><span>  faction  that  the  country  has  been  spared</span><span>  another  political  crisis  this  year.  Thc</span><span>  new  Ministry  were  entitled  to  a  fair  trial,</span><span>  and  fortunately  none  were  more  ready  to</span><span>  acknowledge  this  than  their  leading</span><span>  opponents  in  the  Assembly.  It  is,</span><span>  perhaps,  a  matter  of  regret  that  the</span><span>  Opposition  has  been  somewhat,</span><span>  disorganised,  and  that  during  a  portion</span><span>  of  the  session  no  attempt  was</span></p> <p><span>  made  to  lead  them.  But  this  was  but  a</span></p> <p><span>  natural  result  of  the  tacit  understanding</span><span>  that  Ministers  should  be  allowed  to  play</span><span>  out  their  innings.  And,  after  all,  the</span><span>  Opposition  has  been  tolerably  steady  and</span><span>  effective.  Between  the  assaults  of  oppo-</span><span>  nents  and  the  occasional  defection  of</span><span>  adherents,  the  Government  have  been</span><span>  kept  well  in  check,  and  taught  that  there</span><span>  is  a  power  even  greater  than  themselves,</span><span>  namely,  a  constantly  shifting  majority  in</span><span>  the  Assembly.

Tho</span><span>  petition  in  course  of  preparation  sets  forth</span><span>  the  great  advantages;  a  bridge  over  the</span><span>  Fitzroy  River  would  confer  upon  this</span><span>  district,  and  that  the  work  would</span><span>  certainly,  in  a  few  years  hence,</span><span>  prove  remunerative.  It  further  adds,</span><span>  in  support  of  this  point,  that  the</span><span>  petitioners  have  ""no  desire  lo  gain  an</span><span>  ""advantage  at  the  expense  of  their</span><span>  ""  fellow-colonists  in  other  districts,""  but</span><span>  are  ""  willing  to  bear  their  own  burdens,</span><span>  ""and  to  have  this  and  other  local  works</span><span>  ""made  an  ultimate  charge  upon  thc</span><span>  ""districts  benefiting  by  their  construc</span></p> <p><span>  lion.""</span></p> <p><span>  The  case  is  well  pul  in  the  memorial,</span><span>  and  reijiiires  no  amplification.  There</span><span>  can  be  no  question  that  the  bridge</span><span>  wool'I  be  a  great  boon  to  residents  on</span><span>  both  sides  of  the  river.  The  present</span><span>  means  of  crossing  are  inadéquate  to  the</span><span>  wants  of  tile  distric  t,  rind  the  people  on</span><span>  the  norlli  side  especially  are  subjected</span><span>  lo  enlist.int  annoyance  and  expense</span><span>  as  a  consequence.  These  hindrances  to</span><span>  traffic  are  of  necessity  also  hindrances</span><span>  to  the  seulement  of  population,  and  to</span><span>  thc  increase  of  trade  which  thal  settle-</span><span>  ment  would  ensure,  ll  winnot,  there-</span><span>  fore,  be  disputed  that  a  bridge  is</span><span>  desirable,  provided  its  cost  would  nert</span><span>  be  too  great  lo  admit  of  a  remunerative</span><span>  return.  Wc  have  no  reliable  data  tt]>on</span><span>  which  lo  form  an  estimate  of  the  cost  of</span><span>  the  work  :  hut  we  think  £40,000  ts</span><span>  probably  a  safe  figure.  This  would</span><span>  involve  an  interest  charge-at  five  per</span><span>  cení  -  -of  £2000  per  annum  ;  and  the</span><span>  annual  revenue  arising  from  the  bridge</span><span>  should  cover  this  amount,  together  with</span><span>  the  cost  of  collection,  wear  and  lear,</span><span>  and  unforeseen  expenses.  The  bridge</span></p> <p><span>  lolls  could  be  collected  for  £150  per</span><span>  annum,  and  £350  would  probably  be  a</span><span>  liberal  provision  for  other  expenses.</span><span>  This  calculation  would  require  an  annual</span><span>  revenue  of  about  £2500,  or  scarcely</span><span>  move  iban  double  the  income  now</span><span>  derivable  from  tbe  punt  and  ferries.  No</span><span>  argument  is  necessary  to  shoiv  that  a</span><span>  bridge  would  greatly  increase  the  traffic</span><span>  over  lite  river,  and  to  a  corresponding</span><span>  extent  augment  the  income  from  lolls.</span><span>  Tlie  bridge  would  not  only  serve</span><span>  industrial  purposes  and  promote</span><span>  the  prosperity  of  thc  district,</span><span>  bul  would  greatly  conduce  to  the  health</span><span>  and  recreation  of  the  inhabitants  of</span></p> <p><span>  Rockhampton  by  opening  out  pleasant</span><span>  walks  and  drives  on  the  north  side,  and</span><span>  bringing  Emu  Park  within  easier  reach</span></p> <p><span>  of  tlie  town.  Considerations  of  this  kind</span><span>  are  not  lo  be  overlooked  even  by  hard-</span><span>  headed,  practical  men  such  as  Mr.</span><span>  M'li.witAiTU,  for  they  have  a  very  direct</span><span>  heiring  oil  the  question  as  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  rc-productiveness  of  a  bridge.  Rut  ]</span><span>  beyond  the  direct  income  arising  j</span></p> <p><span>  from  tolls,  there  would  bc  the</span><span>  indirect  revenue  resulting  from  an</span></p> <p><span>  increase  of  settlement  and  in  the  mini-  j</span></p> <p><span>  ber  of  consumers  of  dutiable  goods.</span><span>  There  would  also  bc  a  corresponding</span><span>  increase  in  the  value  of  Crown  lands  in</span><span>  the  district  and  in  the  proceeds  of  land</span><span>  sales.  These  considerations,  taken  to-</span><span>  gether  plainly  demonstrate  that  the  im-</span><span>  mediate  construction  of  a  bridge  over</span><span>  thc  Fitzroy  might  fairly  be  undertaken</span><span>  by  the  Government,  seeing  thal  it  would</span><span>  only  make  use  of  the  public  credit</span><span>  for  a  work  of  a  safely  remunerative</span><span>  character.  lint  should  the  re-</span></p> <p><span>  presentatives  of  the  people,  in</span><span>  Parliament  assembled,  hesitate  to  come</span><span>  to  this  conclusion,  the  petitioners  at</span><span>  Rockhampton  are  perfectly  satisfied  and</span><span>  express  their  willingness  to  have  the  cost</span><span>  of  the  bridge  made  a  charge  upon  the</span><span>  district  benefited  by  it.  There  can  be</span><span>  litlle  doubt  that  were  the  whole  of  that</span><span>  district  possessed  of  adequate  corporate</span><span>  powers,  it  would  not  hesitate  to  under-</span><span>  take  the  construction  of  a  bridge  at  its</span><span>  own  cost,  and  if  Parliament  persists  in</span><span>  withholding  the  powers  of  local  taxation  j</span><span>  and  expenditure  from  the  several  districts</span><span>  of  the  colony,  some  other  plan  must  be</span><span>  devised  for  carrying  out  necessary  public</span><span>  works  011  fair  and  equitable  principles.  :</span><span>  The  people  of  Rockhampton  ask  for  a</span><span>  bridge  over  the  Fitzroy  on  its  own</span><span>  merits,  and  not  because  the  Government</span><span>  propose  lo  construct  bridges  in  other</span><span>  places,  or  because  thc  metropolitans  are</span><span>  endeavouring  lo  bring  pressure  to  bear</span><span>  upon  tile  Parliament  to  take  the  bridge</span><span>  off  their  hands,  and  make  it  free</span><span>  of  lolls.  Hut  they  protest  most  strongly</span><span>  against  the  muddling  way  in  which  the</span><span>  public  revenues  are  kept  and  expended,</span><span>  which  encourages  a  constant  scramble</span><span>  for  Parliamentary  votes  for  local  works</span><span>  without  regard  to  equity.  The  contest,</span><span>  in  fact,  is  one  in  which  the  weaker  of  the</span><span>  combatants  is  sure  to  go  to  the  wall.</span></p> <p><span>  Tlie  motion  of  which  Mr.  BUZACOTT</span><span>  has  given  notice  in  thc  Assembly  offers  a</span><span>  rallying  point  to  the  members  of  the</span><span>  Central  and  Northern  constituencies  to</span><span>  resist  the  over-reaching  schemes  of  the</span><span>  metropolitans,  and  we  trust  they  will  not</span><span>  fail  to  use  the  opportunity  aright.  In</span><span>  dealing  with  this  question,  it  is  important</span><span>  that  the  recognition  of  an  intelligible  and</span><span>  equitable  principle  of  distributing  the</span><span>  public  moneys  should  be  insisted  on,</span><span>  and  that  the  metropolitans  should  be</span><span>  treated  no  better  and  110  worse  than  the</span><span>  residents  of  the  other  parts  of  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  A  srlici  AI.  meeting  of  thc  suliscriliers  to  thc</span><span>  Port  Curtin  and  Leichhardt  District  Hospital</span><span>  will  he  held  in  thc  Court  House,  Bast-street,</span><span>  this  (Tuesday)  afternoon  at  4  o'clock,  to  ap-</span><span>  point  .%  Treasurer  in  tho  room  of  Mr.  T.  ri.</span><span>  J  Lall,  resigned.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  yearly  balance  sheet  of  the  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  Volunteer  Fire  Brigade  is  published  in</span><span>  another  column.

Such  a  chance  of  evoking  the</span><span>  demon  of  discord  was  not  likely  to</span><span>  occur  again  in  this  year  of  grace,  and</span><span>  recollecting  die  warlike  proclivities  of</span><span>  the  Maryborough  public,  it  is  not  sur-</span><span>  prising  that  the  local  Press  determined  to</span><span>  make  the  most  of  their  opportunity.</span><span>  I  How  admirably  they  have  succeeded  is</span></p> <p><span>  shown  by  the  mushroom  crop  of  fulrai</span><span>  I  natory  articles  and  letters  which  has</span><span>  |i  since  choked  out  the  usual  miscellaneous</span></p> <p><span>  extracts,  and  by  the  evidence  such  com</span><span>  ?  njunicavions  supply  that  the  dogs  of  war</span><span>  :  have  again  been  wantonly  let  slip.</span></p> <p><span>  I.  The  chief  apple  of  discord  seems  to</span></p> <p><span>  have  been  thrown  by  the  Rev.  EDWARD</span><span>  TANNER,  the  Church  of  England</span><span>  ,  clergyman,  whose  speech  at  thc  meeting</span><span>  .excited  enthusiasm  and  merriment,  but</span><span>  as  reported  in  the  public  press  became</span><span>  the  subject  of  severe  animadversion</span><span>  when  circulated  amongst  the  general</span><span>  public.  As  published  by  the  Chronicle</span><span>  the  remarks  ol  this  divine  were  really</span><span>  indecent,  but  he  has  since  publicly</span><span>  repudiated  the  report,  and  there  is  reason</span><span>  to  suspect  that  his  speech  was  subjected</span><span>  to  a  considerable  amount  of  ""toning</span><span>  up.""  Thc  Ckroniclc  always  evinces</span><span>  bitter  and  contemptuous  hostility  towards</span><span>  the  Orange  institution,  and  thc  reporter</span><span>  on  the  occasion  appears  to  have  been  an</span><span>  enthusiastic  interpreter  of  the  wishes  of</span><span>  his  chief.  Making  allowance  for</span><span>  exaggeration,  however,  and  accepting</span><span>  Mr.  TANNER'S  disclaimer  regarding  the</span><span>  most  offensive  passages,  thc  speech</span><span>  was  rather  inflammatory,  even  from  thc</span></p> <p><span>  mouth  of  a  clerevman.  lint  it  in!  not</span></p> <p><span>  much  more  objectionable  titan  dozens  of</span><span>  sermons  recently  delivered  irani  Pro-</span><span>  testant  pulpits  in  a!)  parts  of  the  colon}',</span><span>  and  would  have  soon  passed  from  recol-</span><span>  lection  but  for  the  mischievous  inter-</span><span>  meddling  of  thc  Press.  We  have  reason</span><span>  to  believe  that  a  desire  was  expressed  by</span><span>  thc  leaders  of  the  soires  thal  thc  speeches</span><span>  should  not  be  published.  But  that  desire</span><span>  was  not  respected  by  the  leaders  of  public</span><span>  opinion,  and  thc  most  thoughtless  o  nd</span><span>  intolerant  expressions  have  been  pre-</span><span>  sented  in  print  in  all  their  naked  de-</span><span>  formity.  If  we  may  credit  Mr.  TÄNNICH,</span><span>  several  of  his  sentences  have  been  mis-</span><span>  construed  lo  make  them  more  ?  jfit-.i  lit,</span><span>  bul  thc  truth  probably  is  that  in  the</span><span>  excitement  of  the  moment-evoked  by</span><span>  copious  draughts  of  orange  pel.-ie  and</span></p> <p><span>  free  discharges  of  Kentish  ure-Üie  |</span></p> <p><span>  reverend  gentleman  was  betrayed  into</span><span>  some  extravagance  of  language.  Allow-</span><span>  ance  is  commonly  made  for  the  fervour</span><span>  of  pulpit  denunciations,  and,  as  a</span><span>  clergyman,  Mr.  TANNKK  was  perhaps</span><span>  entitled  to  equal  consideration  on  the</span><span>  platform.  His  best  friends  well  know</span><span>  that  although  a  sound  and  acceptable</span><span>  preacher,  he  is  a  gentleman  who  should</span></p> <p><span>  never  appear  in  print  And  he  was  ;</span><span>  perfectly  justified  in  assuming  that,  when  j</span><span>  addressing  a  Protestant  audience  at  the  j</span><span>  festival  of  a  secret  society,  he  would  be  j</span><span>  protected  equally  from  the  reporter's</span><span>  graphic  pen  and  the  editor's  cutting</span><span>  criticism.  Had  Mr.  TANNER  spoken  in</span></p> <p><span>  a  similar  strain  from  his  own  pulpit,  thc  :</span><span>  Press,  according  to  usage,  would  have</span><span>  treated  his  remarks  as  privileged,  and  we</span><span>  think  similar  forbearance  should  have</span><span>  been  shown  when  thc  place  of  delivery</span><span>  was  an  Orange  platform.  Were  every</span><span>  illiberal  sermon,  delivered  both  from</span><span>  Protestant  and  Roman  Catholic  pulpits,</span><span>  afterwards  circulated  in  the  public  news-</span><span>  papers,  the  probability  is  that  thc  colony</span></p> <p><span>  would  soon  be  afflicted  with  social  and</span></p> <p><span>  political  anarchy.  But  such  utterances</span><span>  arc  wisely  allowed  to  pass  unnoticed,</span><span>  and  thus  perfect  freedom  is  secured  to</span><span>  every  man  to  worship  GOD  after  his  own</span><span>  fashion,  and  to  choose  his  own  language</span><span>  in  condemning  what  he  deems  heresy  or</span></p> <p><span>  sunerslition.</span></p> <p><span>  To  many  thoughtful  persons  it  is</span><span>  difficult  to  account  for  the  late  great</span><span>  development  of  the  Orange  Institution</span><span>  in  the  Australian  colonies.  Such</span><span>  societies,  in  a  free  country  untrammelled</span><span>  by  a  State  Church,  one  would  have  sup-</span><span>  posed  to  be  wholly  unnecessary.  Bur,</span><span>  on  the  principle  that  where  there  is</span><span>  smoke  there  must  be  fire,  we  may  assume</span></p> <p><span>  that  there  must  be  a  distinct  cause  of  |</span><span>  the  new  vitality  manifested  by  Orange</span><span>  ism.  The  determination  of  one  parti-</span><span>  cular  church  to  apply  the  public  money</span><span>  to  indoctrinating  the  young  with  its  own</span><span>  particular  theology,  is  probably  the  chief</span><span>  I  rock  of  offence  to  the  members  of  other</span></p> <p><span>  churches,  and  the  real  excuse  for  that</span><span>  powerful  organization  of  enthusiasts</span><span>  who  are  enrolled  under  the  Orange</span><span>  banner.  It  may  be  hoped,  however,</span><span>  that  the  education  question  will  soon  be</span><span>  settled,  and  that  all  hope  of  promulgating</span><span>  sectarian  dogma  by  the  aid  of  public</span><span>  money  will  perisli  with  that  settlement.</span><span>  In  that  case  there  is  every  reason  to  hope</span><span>  that  the  assumed  necessity  of  a  secret</span><span>  society  for  the  protection  of  civil  and</span><span>  religious  liberty  will  be  held  to  have</span><span>  ceased,  and  that  the  flaunting  of  party</span><span>  colours  will  no  longer  excite  ill-will  and</span></p> <p><span>  animadversion.</span></p> <p><span>  At  present,  we  suppose,  the  Orange</span><span>  Society,  if  an  evil,  must  be  recognised  as</span><span>  a  necessary  one.  Hut  it  may  be  hoped</span><span>  that  its  leading  members  will  continue  to</span><span>  manifest  less  and  less  that  spirit  of  into-</span><span>  lerance  the  existence  of  which  must  be</span></p> <p><span>  deplored  by  al)  impartial  colonists.  There</span><span>  is  really  nothing  more  objectionable  in</span><span>  the  written  creed  of  Orangeism  than  in  thc</span><span>  creeds  of  the  several  religious  denomina-</span><span>  tions,  and  so  long  as  excesses  are  dis-</span><span>  countenanced  by  the  leading  members  of</span><span>  the  body,  and  the  columns  of  the  public</span><span>  press  are  not  disfigured  by  thc  extrava-</span><span>  gancies  of  intolerant  speakers,  the  in-</span><span>  fluence  of  the  society  may,  on  the  whole,</span><span>  be  beneficial.  So  long  as  prelates  and</span><span>  their  clergy  continue  to  dabble  in  politics</span><span>  and  attempt  lo  exercise  a  sinister  in-</span><span>  fluence  upon  public  questions  and  public</span><span>  men,-so  long,  we  fear,  the  Orange  in-</span><span>  stitution  will  continue  to  thrive.  But  wc</span><span>  can  only  regard  its  existence  as  a  blot</span><span>  upon  our  civilisation,  and  as  a  melan-</span><span>  choly  proof  that  in  the  opinion  of  large</span><span>  sections  of  the  community,  the  spirit  of</span><span>  intolerance  and  persecution  still  slumbers</span><span>  in  ecclesiastical  breasts.</span></p> <p><span>  It  maybe  hoped  that  our  Maryborough</span><span>  neighbours  will  soon  outgrow  their  no-</span><span>  torious  chronic  tendency  to  squabbling.</span><span>  The  town  is  becoming  important  as  thc</span><span>  seat  of  commercial  enterprise  and  manu-</span><span>  facturing  industry,  and  its  people  should</span><span>  renounce  those  childish  bickerings  and</span><span>  village  politics  which  have  heretofore</span><span>  distinguished  them  and  unquestionably</span><span>  retarded  their  progress.  The  resources</span><span>  of  Maryborough  are  numerous  and  con-</span><span>  centrated,  and  no  town  in  Queensland</span><span>  is  warranted  in  indulging  brighter  antici-</span><span>  pations  of  rapid  and  solid  progress.  In</span><span>  making,  these  comments  we  may  be</span><span>  accused  of  meddling  with  affairs  which</span><span>  do  not  concent  us,  but  knowing  how</span><span>  contagious  is  thc  spirit  of  strife,  we</span><span>  claim  thc  right  to  protest  against  its</span><span>  thoughtless  encouragement  by  reckless</span><span>  neighbours.</span></p> <p><span>  A  GRAND  race  ball  ia  announced  in  our</span><span>  advertising  columns  to  come  off  on  Friday</span><span>  evening  next,  under  thc  direction  of  Miss  Joey</span><span>  Oougouhcim.</span></p> <p><span>  MUCH  dissatisfaction  ha;  been  caused  at</span><span>  Gladstone  by  the  furtive  removal  of  Ibo  Tele-</span><span>  graph  Office  froto  tho  Customs  buildings  to  a</span><span>  wooden  cottage  over  tho  hill  in  tho  direction</span><span>  of  Happy  Valley,  now  become,  through  tho</span><span>  removal  of  the  town  towards  the  wharves,  a</span><span>  valley  of  desolation.

We  are  told  that</span><span>  the  city  is  the  capital  of  Queensland,</span><span>  and  that  its  case  is  one  deserving  of</span><span>  serious  consideration  from  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment.  And  by  way  of  relief  we  are</span><span>  informed  thal  the  Sydney  Corporation</span></p> <p><span>  is  in  a  still  worse  plight,  no  less  a  sum  than</span><span>  a  quarter  of  a  million  being  required  to</span><span>  place  the  finances  of  that  city  on  a  satis-</span><span>  factory  footing.</span></p> <p><span>  It  may  be  allowed  that  some  readjust-</span><span>  ment  of  the  affairs  of  the  Brisbane</span><span>  Corporation  is  absolutely  necessary.  At</span><span>  the  same  time,  Ute  public  of  thc  colony</span><span>  may  well  object  to  any  special  legislation</span><span>  giving  endowments  and  privileges  to  the</span><span>  metropolitan  city.  We  arc  told  that  it  is</span><span>  the  capital  of  Queensland,  which  is  true</span><span>  enough  in  a  political  sense,  but  thal  h  is</span><span>  only  the  capital  partially  and  temporarily</span><span>  must  be  apparent  to  everyone.  Were  it</span><span>  in  a  central  position,  and  naturally  fitted</span><span>  to  become  the  commercial  as  well</span><span>  as  the  political  capital  of  the</span><span>  colony,  it  might,  likê  Sydney,  claim</span><span>  special  consideration,  although  we  con-</span><span>  fess  inability  lo  see  thc  reason  why.</span><span>  The  capital  derives  immense  advantages</span><span>  in  many  ways.  Its  population  is  swelled</span><span>  by  a  whole  army  of  civil  servants,  who</span><span>  are  paid  out  of  the  revenues  of  the  whole</span><span>  colony,  but  who  spend  their  earnings  in</span><span>  thc  metropolis,  thus  increasing  its  trade,</span><span>  enhancing  the  value  of  its  lands,  and</span><span>  generally  adding  to  its  prosperity.</span><span>  Surely  this  aspect  of  thc  case  is  worth</span><span>  considering,  as  well  as  the  other,  and  it</span><span>  ts  asking  rather  too  much  that  the  city</span></p> <p><span>  shall  be  beautified  principally  at  the  cost  ;</span><span>  of  thc  people  of  the  provincial  districts,  ¡</span><span>  who  are  themselves  at  their  wits'  ends  to  |</span><span>  find  money  for  essential  public  improve-</span></p> <p><span>  ments.</span></p> <p><span>  We  are  quite  prepared  to  admit,  how-</span><span>  ever,  that  something  must  be  done  for</span><span>  the  metropolitanCorporation.  But  there</span><span>  is  no  need  to  deal  with  it  specially,  or</span><span>  to  confer  upon  it  privileges  which  must</span><span>  be  withheld  from  Maryborough,  Rock-</span><span>  hampton,  or  Townsville,  lt  may  be</span><span>  true  enough  that  none  of  the  towns</span><span>  mentioned  are  in  the  desperate  strait</span><span>  that  Brisbane  has  fallen  into.  «But  why?</span><span>  Not  because  they  did  not  want  good</span><span>  streets,  bridges,  and  town  halls,  but</span><span>  because,  not  possessing  the  means,  they</span><span>  did  not  plunge  into  debt  regardless  of</span><span>  consequences.  They  have  made  streets</span><span>  and  built  municipal  chambers  according</span><span>  to  their  means,  and  they  have  not</span><span>  attempted  to  build  a  bridge  at  all,</span><span>  whereas  Brisbane  many  years  since</span><span>  contemplated  spending  ;£i  00,000  on</span><span>  the  town  hall  and  bridge  alone.  Instead</span><span>  of  that  amount  thc  outlay  has  reached</span><span>  nearly  twice  that  sum  ;  but  even  the</span><span>  originally  contemplated  expenditure  was</span><span>  enormous  for  a  city  whose  annual  taxes</span><span>  taxes  did  not  exceed  .£3000  to  ,£4000.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  not  our  object,  however,  to  dwell</span><span>  upon  the  mistakes  of  thc  Brisbane</span><span>  people,  who  probably  have  done  no</span><span>  more  than  the  people  of  Maryborough</span><span>  or  Rockhampton  would  have  done  if</span><span>  similarly  placed.  But  it  is  incumbent</span><span>  upon  us  to  see  that  when  any  municipal</span><span>  readjustment  takes  place  it  shall  bc</span><span>  done  on  some  well  defined  principle</span><span>  capable  of  application  to  the  provincial</span><span>  municipalities  as  well  as  to  thc  metropolis.</span><span>  Thc  fact  appears  to  be  that  local</span><span>  government  in  Queensland  has  failed  so</span><span>  frequently  because  of  thc  insufficiency  of</span><span>  municipal  revenues.  In  many  cases</span><span>  incompetent  officers  have  had  to  be</span><span>  employed,  because  the  salaries  requisite</span><span>  to  _  secure  good  and  trustworthy  men</span><span>  could  not  be  given.  We  owe  much  of</span><span>  the  success  of  the  Rockhampton  muni-</span><span>  cipality  to  the  fact  that  competent  and</span><span>  fairly  paid  officers  have  as  a  rule</span><span>  been  employed.

To  bring  in</span><span>  a  measure  for  the  reform  of  thc  Upper</span><span>  House,  would  have  been  resented  as  an</span><span>  infringement  upon  the  lights  and  privi-</span><span>  leges  of  that  notable  body,  and  would</span><span>  not  have  had  the  remotest  chance  of  its</span><span>  sanction.  Granted  thal  some  reform</span><span>  which  will  prevent  future  deadlocks  is</span><span>  necessary,  it  becomes  a  mool  point  willi</span><span>  which  House  reform  shall  begin.  Thc</span><span>  Legislative  Assembly  may  claim  to</span><span>  represent  thc  whole  (iconic,  but</span><span>  the  Legislative  Council  claims  lo</span><span>  ile  the  chosen  exponent  of  the</span><span>  wealthy  and  educated  classes,  and  lo</span><span>  enjoy  equal  rights  with  the  Lower  House.</span><span>  There  is  a  chronic  quarrel  between  thc</span><span>  two  chambers,  but  who  shall  decide</span><span>  which  is  in  thc  wrong?  Any  amend-</span><span>  ment  of  the  Constitution  intended  to</span><span>  throw  the  balance  of  power  into  the</span><span>  hands  of  the  Assembly  or  of  the</span><span>  Government  for  the  time  being,  if</span><span>  accepted  by  the  Council,  would  bc  a</span><span>  tacit  admission  that  it  was  wrong,  and  an</span><span>  acknowledgment  of  responsibility  for</span><span>  all  the  obstruction  which  has  unhappily</span><span>  occurred  in  past  years.  This  is  one  of</span><span>  the  last  things  that  the  Victorian  peers</span><span>  are  disposed  to  do,  and  Mr.  FRANCIS</span><span>  perfectly  understands  that  it  would  be</span><span>  useless  to  ask  them.  He  had</span><span>  before  him  the  fact  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  rejection  of  Mr.  1'AUKF.S'  bill  for</span><span>  reconstructing  the  Legislative  Council  of</span><span>  NcwSouth  Wales,  in  which  reform  it  might</span><span>  have  been  anticipated  thal  a  majority  of</span><span>  the  existing  House  would  be  but  to</span><span>  glad  to  concur.  A  nominee  chamber</span><span>  enjoys  neither  the  influence  nor  respect</span><span>  that  is  commanded  by  an  elective  House,</span><span>  and  hence  it  might  be  reasonably  sup-</span><span>  posed  that  no  strong  objection  would  be</span><span>  raised  to  the  proposed  transformation.</span><span>  Hut  experience  has  proved  otherwise,</span><span>  and  il  is  extremely  doubtful  whether</span><span>  any  measure  for  making  the  Upper</span><span>  House  in  New  South  Wales  elective,  will</span><span>  ever  be  accepted  by  the  existing  mem-</span><span>  bers  of  the  legislative  Council.  And</span><span>  therefore,  unless  the  GOVKRNOR  and  his</span><span>  advisers  can  agree  to  adopt  the  violent</span><span>  expedient  of  ""  swamping  ""  the  Council,</span><span>  it  will  remain  a  nominee  chamber  to  the</span><span>  end  of  thc  chapter.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  FRANCIS'  proposal  is  unquestion-</span><span>  ably  a  leap  in  the  dark.  No  precedent</span><span>  can  be  found  for  it  in  Great  Britain  or</span><span>  any  of  her  dependencies,  at  any  rate.</span><span>  Ils  prospects  of  success  are  at  least  pro</span><span>  I  blcmatical,  and  if  the  experiment  Tail  it</span></p> <p><span>  is  difficult  lo  see  how  a  proper  remedy</span><span>  can  bc  applied  without  Imperial  inler</span><span>  I  vention.  The  proposal  is,  that  in  case  of</span></p> <p><span>  a  future  deadlock  upon  any  measure,  the</span><span>  GOVERNOR  shall  prorogue  Parliament,</span><span>  and  convene  a  session  of  members  of</span><span>  both  Houses,  who  shall  sit  and  vole</span><span>  togelhe-  as  members  of  a  single  chamlicr.</span><span>  But  it  is  not  intended  to  repeal  or  affect</span><span>  in  any  way  the  provisions  of  the  Con-</span><span>  stitution  which  remire  thal  every  measure</span><span>  shrill  be  passed  by  an  absolute  majority</span><span>  of  members  of  both  Houses.  So  that,</span><span>  il  would  appear,  the  decision  of  the</span><span>  temporarily  amalgamated  Chamber  will</span><span>  only  carry  the  weight  of  a  recommen-</span><span>  dation,  and  the  bill  over  which  thc</span><span>  conflict  has  arisen  must  afterwards</span><span>  receive  the  concurrence  of  au  absolute</span><span>  majority  of  both  Houses  of  Parliament</span><span>  in  the  ordinary  way.  Any  greater  power</span><span>  given  to  the  joint  Chamber  would  be</span><span>  simply  a  pinn  for  over-riding  the  decisions</span><span>  of  the  Upper  House,  and  would  cer-</span><span>  tainly  be  negatived  by  that  body.  Tile</span><span>  remedy,  however,  becomes  a  cumber-</span><span>  some  one,  and  its  success  is  very  doubt-</span><span>  ful.  The  only  hope  seems  to  rest  in  the</span><span>  assumption  thal  when  both  ""  Lords  and</span><span>  Commons""  assemble  as  one  House,</span><span>  there  will  be  a  greater  probability</span></p> <p><span>  of  concord  ihan  when  lhere  is  a</span></p> <p><span>  conllict  of  opinion  between  two  rival</span><span>  chambers.  I5ut  as  in  Queensland  we</span><span>  have  proved  the  possibility  of  getting  up</span><span>  a  deadlock  in  a  single  House,  the  plan</span><span>  of  Mr.  FRANCIS  supplies  no  sufficient</span><span>  guarantee  thal  it  will  meet  thc  exigencies</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  situation.</span></p> <p><span>  In  adopting  the  elective  system  in  this</span><span>  colony,  if  ever  public  opinion  demands</span><span>  such  a  step,  il  might  lie  some  safeguard</span><span>  against  deadlock  lo  repose  in  the  Go</span><span>  I  VERNOR  power,  under  certain  circum</span></p> <p><span>  stances,  to  dissolve  thc  Upper  House  as</span><span>  well  as  the  Ijjwcr.  And  it  is  somewhat</span><span>  strange  Uiat  Mr.  FRANCIS  does  not  suggest</span><span>  that  course  instead  of  a  joint  session  of</span><span>  both  Houses.  Hts  plan,  no  doubt,  has  thc</span><span>  merit  of  keeping  political  power  strictly</span><span>  in  Ute  hands  of  the  people's  representa-</span><span>  tives,  and  limits  to  thc  «tmost  the</span><span>  prerogative  of  thc  Crown.  But  whether</span><span>  fear  of  the  prerogative  is  not  a  mere</span><span>  bugbear  is  open  to  question,  for  HO</span><span>  colonial  GOVERNOR  is  likely  to  so</span><span>  exercise  his  powers  as  to  infringe  upon</span><span>  the  political  liberties  or  privileges  of</span><span>  Her  MAJKSTV'S  Australian  subjects.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  whole,  we  think  thc  colonists</span><span>  of  Queensland  have  cause  for  satisfaction</span><span>  thal  they  arc  not  governed  by  two  elec-</span><span>  tive  Chambers.  With  a  nominee  Council</span><span>  there  is  a  safety-valve  which  precludes  all</span><span>  dread  of  n  deadlock,  and  places  a</span><span>  wholesome  limit  upon  thc  power  of  the</span><span>  Conservative  Chamber.  The  possibility</span><span>  of  ""  swamping  ""  lends  to  keep  honorable</span><span>  gentlemen  from  running  to  extremes,  and</span><span>  if  they  do  occasionally  postpone  salutary</span><span>  reforms,  they  also  sometimes  place  their</span><span>  veto  upon  hasty  and  ill-advised  measures.</span><span>  Whenever  public  opinion  pronounces</span><span>  distinctly  upon  any  great  question,  and</span><span>  llie  popular  chamber  endorses  the  ver</span><span>  din,  the  legislative  Council  cannot  long</span><span>  withstand  the  pressure.  Tile  mere</span><span>  threat  to  swamp  the  refractory  chamber</span><span>  is,  in  fact,  found  a  sufficient  guarantee</span><span>  against  obstructive  tactics.  This  subject</span><span>  may  appear  abstruse  lo  many  readers,</span><span>  but  il  is  neither  desirable  nor  expedient</span><span>  lhat  tlie  cry  for  constitutional  reform</span><span>  which  now  agitates  the  adjacent  colonies,</span><span>  should  he  treated  as  a  matter  in  which  the</span><span>  people  of  Queensland  have  no  interest.</span></p> ",Article,1874-03-21,"The Rockhampton Bulletin, WITH WHICH IS INCORPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER.

The  mining  laws  of  other</span><span>  colonies  being  available  to  the</span><span>  Commission,  and  the  peculiar  cir-</span><span>  cumstances  of  each  gold-field  having</span><span>  been  ascertained  by  personal  inspection</span><span>  and  information  al  first  hand  from  actual</span><span>  miners  on  the  spot,  it  was  believed  thal</span><span>  Mr.  I'KINC'S  bill,  if  not  accepted  in  its</span><span>  entirety  by  the  Legislature,  would  al</span><span>  least  form  the  basis  of  future  legislation.</span><span>  Hut  the  Commission  bill  was  re-</span><span>  jected,  several  yearn  have  since  passed,</span><span>  and  up  to  the  lime  when  Parliament</span><span>  lasl  assembled  no  apparent  progress  had</span><span>  been  made  on  this  ipieslion.  On  the</span><span>  contrary,  certain  revised  regulations,</span><span>  issued  no  earlier  than  October  last,  were</span><span>  termed  impracticable  and  contradictory</span><span>  by  Mr.  MACROSSAN,  a  member  returned</span><span>  by  one  of  the  chief  gold-fields  constitu-</span><span>  encies  ;  and  it  is  believed  that  by  his</span><span>  advice,  supported  by  that  of  Mr.  HODG-</span><span>  KINSON-,  another  gold-fields  member,</span><span>  the  new  regulations  were  summarily</span><span>  abrogated,  and  the  old  ones  temporarily</span></p> <p><span>  re-enacted.

Whether</span><span>  the  Assembly  will  assent  to  this  change,</span><span>  however,  is  somewhat  questionable,  lt</span><span>  may  be  true  that  the  evisting  department</span><span>  of  Works  and  Mines  is  overburdened,</span><span>  and  that  no  one  Minister  can  be  ex-</span><span>  pected  io  bestow  the  needful  attention</span></p> <p><span>  upon  both  brandies.

Without</span><span>  a  practical  man  as  Minister  for  Mines</span></p> <p><span>  it  would  be  of  little  use  to  create  a  j</span><span>  special  mining  department,  and  therefore</span><span>  we  think  it  will  be  held  thal  the  wants  of</span><span>  the  gold-fields  will  be  best  met  by  a  sub-</span><span>  division  of  the  existing  Works  and  Mines</span><span>  department,  and  by  the  appointment  of  a</span><span>  trained  Under-secretary  fo  each  brandi,</span><span>  i  There  is  also  another  method  in  which</span></p> <p><span>  I  the  duties  of  the  Minister  for  Works</span></p> <p><span>  might  be  simplified,  and  his  attention</span><span>  given  more  fully  to  thc  mining  a  (Ta  i  rs  of</span><span>  the  colony.  Were  a  measure  of  financial</span><span>  separation  and  load  government  passed,</span><span>  the  functions  of  the  Works  J  leparlinent</span><span>  would  devolve  almost  entirely  upon  local</span><span>  bodies.  The  Minister  would  then  not</span><span>  lind  it  necessary  to  travel  through  the</span><span>  country  to  inspect  roads,  bridges,  lock-</span><span>  ups,  and  court-houses,  but  would  be  free</span><span>  to  explore  the  various  gold-fields  of  the</span><span>  colony.  This  last,  we  are  inclined  to</span><span>  think,  is  the  true  remedy  for  the  neglect  of</span><span>  which  the  gold-lields  members  now  com-</span><span>  plain,  as  it  has  the  merit  of  redressing</span><span>  two  grievances  by  one  legislative  effort.</span></p> <p><span>  Decentralisation  is  what  the  whole</span></p> <p><span>  colony  most  needs  al  the  present  time,</span><span>  and  it  would  be  a  step  in  the  wrong</span><span>  direction  lo  aim  at  giving  Public  Works</span><span>  greater  importance  by  constituting  for</span><span>  them  a  distinct  department  presided  over</span><span>  by  a  Responsible  Minister.  It  may  be</span><span>  hoped,  therefore,  thal  the  clause  of  the</span><span>  new  bill  providing  for  a  Mining  Minister,</span></p> <p><span>  will  either  be  withdrawn  before  the</span><span>  measure  is  laid  before  Parliament,  or</span><span>  that  it  will  be  expunged  by  the  majority</span></p> <p><span>  in  Cummittee  of  the  Whole.</span></p> <p><span>  lt  is  a  matter  worth  consideration,</span><span>  whether  the  new  gold-fields  bill  should</span><span>  not  be  a  consolidating  measure</span><span>  whether,  in  fad,  il  should  not  embrace</span><span>  mining  enterprises  of  all  descriptions.</span><span>  There  is,  for  example,  one  very  important</span><span>  point  in  which  our  regulations  for  mining</span></p> <p><span>  on  other  than  aurifeiioits  lands  are</span></p> <p><span>  defective.  Nro  protection  area  is  at</span><span>  present  obtainable  for  copper,  silver,</span><span>  kerosene  shale,  or  oilier  mineral  deposits.</span><span>  A  man  who  believes  he  has  discovered  a</span></p> <p><span>  copper  lode  cannot  safely  explore  it  until</span><span>  he  lias  applied  for  a  mineral  selection</span><span>  and  paid  the  deposit  of  five  shillings  per</span><span>  acre.  Now  this  is  a  direct  discourage</span><span>  «.t  rr,WM«,  ir  lu-  .nat--  ?in-</span></p> <p><span>  application  in  due  form,  and  the</span><span>  discovery  turn  out  valueless,  the</span><span>  applicant  loses  not  only  his  labour  bul</span><span>  also  his  'deposit  money.  If  lie  explore</span><span>  without  having  first  made  the  application,</span><span>  he  is  al  the  mercy  of  any  speculator,</span><span>  who  may  possibly  find  the  employment</span><span>  of  ""jumping""  more  profitable  than</span><span>  prospecting  or  exploring.  The  remedy</span><span>  for  this  evil  is  easily  suggested.  Let  the</span><span>  protection  area  be  granted  for  any</span><span>  mineral  lands;  in  order  that  every</span><span>  encouragement  may  be  given  lo  the</span><span>  prospector,  and  reasonable  protection</span><span>  afforded  him  in  the  prosecution  of</span><span>  his  arduous  and  generally  ill-reipiitcd</span></p> <p><span>  labours.</span></p> <p><span>  It  may  be  hoped  that  the  promised</span><span>  Mining  Dill  will  prove  a  comprehensive</span><span>  and  well-digested  measure,  and  that</span><span>  honorable  members  will  give  il  ihe</span><span>  careful  attention  demanded  by  a  subject</span><span>  of-so  great  importance  to  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  M  nib)  per  s.n.  llolclutha  fur  Maryborough</span><span>  Alni  Sydney  will  elmo  nt  1  'HO  p.in.  tn-day.</span></p> <p><span>  I'm-:  luring  of  tke  immigrants  at  thc  ilepôl</span><span>  is  proceeding  apaej.

The  differences  of  opinion</span><span>  among  practical  miners  and  their  advo-</span><span>  cates  are  so  important  and  essential,  that</span><span>  people  not  engaged  in  unearthing  the</span><span>  precious  metal  may  well  doubt  their</span><span>  ability  to  suggest  a  practical  solution  for</span><span>  the  many  problems  by  which  all  attempts</span><span>  al  reform  are  beset.  It  was  on  this  ac-</span><span>  count  that  we  were  rejoiced  to  hear  that</span><span>  thc  three  norther»  gold-fields  members</span><span>  had  taken  the  subject  in  hand,  and  de-</span><span>  termined  to  produce  a  bill  ""  not  incon-</span><span>  sistent  in  itself,""  nor  likely  to  be</span><span>  contradictory  lo  the  regulations  which</span><span>  might  be  afterwards  based  upon  il.</span><span>  Those  who  drafted  regulations  under</span><span>  the  existing  Act  were  in  a  position  of</span><span>  great  difficulty.  Thc  law  was  not</span><span>  adapted  to  the  circumstances  of  Ihc</span><span>  colony,  and  in  the  attempt  to  make  il</span><span>  available,  regulations  inconsistent  willi</span><span>  its  provisions  were  put  in  force.  In  the</span><span>  absence  of  proper  legislation,  this  was</span><span>  making  the  best  of  a  bad  business,</span><span>  especially  as  there  was  no  immédiate</span><span>  prospect  of  Parliament  passing  an</span><span>  amended  Act.  Our  legislators,  in  fact,</span><span>  confessed  their  incompetency,  and,</span><span>  whether  Conservatives  or  Liberals  held</span><span>  the  reins,  the  measures  introduced  on</span><span>  this  question  were  equally  doomed  to</span></p> <p><span>  deserved  oblivion.</span></p> <p><span>  Of  late,  however,  the  cry  for  gold-fields</span><span>  law  reform  has  become  vigorous.  Some</span><span>  years  since,  when  the  Gympie  gold-field</span><span>  assumed  importance  and  permanence,  il</span><span>  was  hoped  that  all  the  ills  that  mining</span><span>  flesh  was  heir  to  would  be  «cured  by  the</span></p> <p><span>  constitution  of  a  local  court.  Thal  was</span></p> <p><span>  a  slight  improvement  upon  tile  despotic</span><span>  Commissioner,  but  on  the  whole  the</span><span>  success  of  the  court  was  of  a  very</span><span>  qualified  character.  The  gold  discoveries</span><span>  \n  the  liorlb  then  followed,  and  a  local</span><span>  court  being  deemed  undesirable,  the  old</span><span>  demand  for  a  new  Gold-fields  Act  was</span><span>  resumed,  and  has  resulted  in  the  return</span><span>  to  Parliament  of  two  representative«</span><span>  intimately  connected  with  the  gold</span><span>  mining  interest,  .and  also  of  a  risinp</span><span>  barrister  who,  in  bis  newly  acquired  posi</span><span>  tion  of  ATTOKNKV-GENRRAI,  was  anxiotif</span><span>  to  gain  distinction  by  claiming  thc  pater</span><span>  nity  of  a  measure  specially  suited  to  tht</span><span>  circumstances  of  the  colony.  The  result</span></p> <p><span>  is  seen  in  a  new  Gold  fields  bill,  a.</span><span>  copy  of  which  is  now  before  us,  with  a</span><span>  polite  request  for  editorial  opinions  and</span><span>  suggestions  with  reference  to  it.  Appre-</span><span>  ciating  the  delicate  compliment  conveyed</span><span>  in  the  invitation,  we  have  cursorily  exa-</span><span>  mined  the  Bill  without  prejudice,  and</span><span>  are  free  to  confess  that  iv  appears  to  he</span><span>  a  much  belter  measure  than  could  have</span><span>  been  reasonably  anticipated.  And  as</span><span>  lhere  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  it</span><span>  will  be  treated  by  the  Legislature  strictly</span><span>  on  its  merits,  the  presumption  is  that,</span><span>  with  sundry  amendments,  it  will  even-</span><span>  tually  become  Jaw.  It  would  be  impos-</span><span>  sible  in  a  single  article  to  deal  exhaus-</span><span>  tively  with  a  measure  like  that  nowbefore</span><span>  us.  We  shall  therefore  at  present  be</span><span>  content  with  giving  the  reader  a  general</span><span>  survey  of  thc  Hill,  reserving  extended</span><span>  comments  until  its  provisions  have  been</span><span>  explained  and  illustrated  by  its  hon.  and</span><span>  learned  author  in  moving  the  second</span><span>  reading  in  the  Legislative  Assembly.</span></p> <p><span>  The  ""  Gold-fields  Act  of  1874  ""  con-</span><span>  tains  one  hundred  and  seven  clauses,</span><span>  which  extend  over  nineteen  Gazette</span></p> <p><span>  pages  of  printed  matter.  For  conveni-</span><span>  ence  the  clauses  are  grouped  in  several</span><span>  divisions,  into  which  the  subject  natu-</span><span>  rally  falls.

With  this  pro-</span><span>  vision  we  at  present  totally  disagree,</span><span>  believing  thal  the  case  would  be  met  by</span><span>  a  sub-division  of  the  existing  Works</span><span>  and  Mines  department,  and  the</span><span>  appointment  of  an  UNIIICR-SJÍCRUTAKV</span><span>  FOR  MINKS.  Dui  on  this  point'  we  are</span><span>  open  to  conviction,  if  it  be  shown  by  the</span><span>  author  of  the  bill  that  the  gold-fields  of</span><span>  Ihe  colony  need  the  supervision  of  a</span><span>  Responsible  Minister  of  ihe  Crown,</span><span>  specially  appointed  for  that  purpose.</span><span>  Clause  7  empowers  the  GUVKKNUK-IX</span><span>  GouNCti,  lo  appoint  all  officers  necessary</span><span>  to  carry  out  thc  provisions  of  the  Act.</span></p> <p><span>  The  second  division  of  the  measure</span></p> <p><span>  deals  with  ""  Miners'  Rights  ""  in  five</span><span>  clauses.  Clause  S  provides  for  the  issue</span><span>  of  such  documents  for  any  term  not</span><span>  exceeding  five  years,  on  payment  of  a</span><span>  sum  al  the  rate  of  ten  shillings  per</span><span>  annum,  for  every  year  that  the  right  is  in</span><span>  force.  Clause  9  provides  for  Consoli-</span><span>  dated  Miners'  Rights,  which  will  be</span><span>  issued  to  companies  registered  under  the</span><span>  Act,  on  payment  of  a  sum  for  each  miner</span><span>  represented,  at  the  same  rate  as  if  so</span><span>  many  single  rights  were  obtained.  The</span><span>  Miners'  Rights  tuc  all  to  terminate  on</span><span>  31st  December,  and  after  the  30th  June</span><span>  they  will  be  issued  at  the  rate  of  five</span><span>  shillings  each  for  the  remaining  portion</span><span>  of  thc  year.  This  provision,  we  should</span><span>  think,  will  give  much  satisfaction  to  the</span><span>  diggers,  and  will  not  seriously  increase</span><span>  the  clerical  duties  of  the  ""Wardens,""  lo</span><span>  whom  tile  existing  Commissioners  are  tb</span><span>  give  place.  Clause  12  specifies  in  detail</span><span>  thc  privileges  conferred  by  the  Miners'</span><span>  Right,  which,  in  addition  to  digging  for</span><span>  gold,  empowers  the  holder  lo  construct</span><span>  races  and  reservoirs,  cut  timber,  etc.,  etc.</span><span>  Thc  clause  also  empowers  the  holder  of</span><span>  a  claim  lo  assign  or  encumber  the  same.</span></p> <p><span>  The  next  division  is  headed  ""  Mining</span><span>  Incases,""  for  the  issue  of  which  it  pro-</span><span>  vides.

The  special  condition,  however,</span><span>  is  provided  by  clause  15,  that  such  leases</span></p> <p><span>  shall  be  voidable  at  thc  will  of  the  GO-</span><span>  VERNOR  should  the  land  referred  to  in</span></p> <p><span>  them  not  be  used  ""honâ,fiâ-e.  for  the  pur</span><span>  ""  pose  for  which  it  shall  be  demised.""</span><span>  Thc  WAUDEN  is  empowered  to  ""  Iwir,</span><span>  ""  receive,  and  examine  evidence  in  rela</span><span>  ""  tion  to  the  application  for  any  such</span><span>  *  lease,  and  the  objections  thereto.""</span><span>  This  seems  a  salutary  provision,  and  one</span><span>  likely  lo  prevent  subsequent  disputes  and</span><span>  litigation.  Tile  17th  and  three  following</span><span>  clauses  provide  thal  the  application  for  a</span><span>  lease,  if  refused,  shall  not  affect  land</span><span>  held  under  a  Miner's  Right  ;  thal  actions</span><span>  for  ejectment  may  be  brought  in  the</span><span>  district  court;  that  it  shall  not  beobligatory</span><span>  on  ihe  part  of  the  Warden  to  grant</span></p> <p><span>  leases,  although  the  applicant  must,  in  j</span><span>  such  case,  be  informed  of  the  reasons  of  j</span><span>  refusal  ;  and  that  any  lease  may  be</span><span>  surrendered,  and  a  new  one  obtained  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  whole  or  any  portion  of  a  leased  1</span><span>  area.  This  provision,  we  presume,  is  j</span><span>  intended  to  provide  for  the  division  of</span><span>  interest  in  any  leased  land.</span></p> <p><span>  Clauses  21  to  24  relate  to  business</span><span>  licenses,  which  do  not  call  for  special</span></p> <p><span>  remark.  Clauses  25  1032  provide  for  the  j</span><span>  issue  of  publican's  licenses  on  gold-fields,  j</span><span>  which  are  lo  be  issued  by  the  j</span><span>  ""  Warder  in  his  discretion,""  on  payment  !</span><span>  of  an  annual  fee  o(  jQiO.  Such  licenses  !</span><span>  are  not  to  be  transferable,  but  may  be  j</span><span>  cancelled,  and  new  licenses  issued  for</span><span>  the  remainder  of  the  tenn  011  payment  of</span></p> <p><span>  a  fee  of  ten  shillings.  j</span></p> <p><span>  Clauses  33  to  41  provide  for  the  pro-</span><span>  clamation  of  gold-fields  by  the  GOVER-</span><span>  NOR.

It  was  next  asserted</span><span>  that  the  bill  would  be  altered  back  to  its</span><span>  state  when  first  introduced  into  the</span><span>  Assembly,  the  opinion  being  that  in  such</span><span>  form  it  would  conserve  the  interests  of</span><span>  the  pastoral  tenants  by  obstructing</span><span>  settlement  upon  the  lands.  For  a  time</span><span>  this  idea  appeared  to  ""  take  ""  amazingly,</span><span>  and  it  was  held  that  a  more  effectual</span><span>  means  of  condemning  a  Liberal  Ministry</span><span>  could  not  have  been  devised.  But  as</span><span>  time  sped,  other  counsels  prevailed,  and,</span><span>  if  report  speak  truly,  a  caucus  meeting  of</span><span>  i  the  ""  Lords""  was  held  on  the  morning  of</span><span>  I  the  day  on  which  the  bill  was  to  be  con-</span></p> <p><span>  sidered  in  committee.  At  that  meeting,</span><span>  it  is  understood,  the  Hon.  F.T.  GREGORY,</span><span>  a  brother  of  the  Surveyor-General,  sub-</span></p> <p><span>  mitted  certain  amendments  with  the  view  j</span></p> <p><span>  of  making  the  measure  of  the  Lower  ;</span><span>  House  a  ""good  bill,""  as  that  term  is</span><span>  understood  amongst  gentlemen  who  are,</span></p> <p><span>  rightly  or  wrongly,  deemed  ultra-  j</span></p> <p><span>  conservatives  in  politics.  The  sug-</span><span>  gestions  of  Mr.  GREGORY  appear  to</span><span>  have  met  with  approval,  for  at  the  sitting</span><span>  of  the  Council  that  afternoon  they  were  j</span><span>  submitted  and  nearly  all  adopted  with</span><span>  scarcely  a  show  of  discussion.  This</span><span>  proceeding  was  at  least  impolitic,  and</span><span>  that  in  more  ways  than  one.  The  ori-</span><span>  ginal  bill  was  the  product  of  Mr.  A.  C.</span><span>  GREGORY,  the  Surveyor-General,  and  it</span><span>  was  considerably  ""improved  upon,""</span><span>  firstly,  by  the  MINISTER  FOR  LANDS,</span><span>  and  secondly  by  the  Legislative  Assem-</span><span>  bly.  From  thc  prominent  part  taken  by</span><span>  Mr.  F.  T.  GREGORY  in  amending  the  bill,</span><span>  it  naturally  came  to  be  whispered  that</span><span>  he  was  in  reality  only  the  mouth-piece  of</span><span>  the  SURVEYOR-GENERAL,  and  that  by</span><span>  this  means  that  astute  official  had  again</span><span>  effectually  checkmated  the  responsible</span><span>  head  of  his  department.  But  the  mode</span><span>  in  which  the  amendments  were  made</span><span>  was  deemed  objectionable  on  other</span><span>  grounds.  It  was  held  to  be  scarcely</span><span>  decent  when  some  dozen  honourable</span><span>  gentlemen,  who  were  themselves  pastoral</span><span>  tenants,  sat  around  the  Council  table</span><span>  with  the  avowed  determination  to  emas-</span><span>  culate  a  measure  passed  through  another</span><span>  chamber  by  the  people's  representatives</span><span>  after  prolonged  discussion  and  delibera-</span><span>  tion.  And  it  was  contended  that  the</span><span>  proper  course  for  thc  Council  to  take</span><span>  was  to  reject  the  bill  on  the  ninth  clause,</span><span>  which  was  really  tim  obstacle  to  the</span><span>  measure  becoming  law.  The  Council</span><span>  held  unnecessary  resumption  to  be</span><span>  actual  repudiation,  and  it  »mst  be</span><span>  confessed  that  cogent  arguments  have</span><span>  been  adduced  in  support  of  that</span><span>  opinion.  Thc  ten  years'  leases  were</span><span>  granted  in  good  faith,  and  the  lands</span><span>  included  in  them  were  only  to  be</span><span>  resumed  when  required  for  settlement.</span><span>  Thc  bill,  however,  assumed  that  all  the</span><span>  lands  within  the  limits  of  the  settled</span></p> <p><span>  districts  wer«  required,-notoriously  an</span><span>  unsound  assumption,-and  had  the  Legis-</span><span>  lative  Council  rejected  the  measure  on</span><span>  that  ground,  while  expressing  a  desire  to</span><span>  meet  all  reasonable  demands  for  settle-</span></p> <p><span>  ment,  they  would  have  occupied  a</span></p> <p><span>  position  from  which  it  would  be  unneces-</span><span>  sary  to  retreat.  Such  a  stand-point</span><span>  might  not  have  protected  them  from  the</span><span>  assaults  of  rabid  land  law  reformers,  but</span><span>  it  would  have  secured  to  them  the</span></p> <p><span>  sympathy  of  every  moderate  man  in  the</span><span>  country.  It  is  undeniable  that  thc</span><span>  Ministry  could  have  easily  ascertained</span><span>  where  land  was  actually  required,  and  that</span><span>  their  throwing  the  onus  of  proof  on  the</span><span>  individual  selector  was  an  exhibition  of</span><span>  moral  cowardice  which  could  only  be</span><span>  tolerated  in  a  professedly  Liberal</span><span>  Ministry.  It  is  quite  certain  that  had</span><span>  the  Government  brought  popular  pressure</span><span>  to  bear  in  favour  of  needful  resumptions</span><span>  alone  during  the  currency  of  the  leases,</span><span>  the  Legislative  Council  must  have</span><span>  yielded  to  a  demand  the  justice  and</span><span>  expediency  of  which  could  not  have</span><span>  been  fairly  questioned.  And  if  the</span><span>  further  stipulation  had  been  made  that</span><span>  at  the  termination  of  the  leases  four</span><span>  years  he:ice  there  should  be  no  renewals</span><span>  but  absolute  free  selection  throughout</span><span>  the  country,  the  cry  of  repudiation</span><span>  could  not  have  been  raised  with  even  a</span><span>  semblance  of  justice.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Upper  House,  therefore,  are</span><span>  greatly  to  blame  for  having  neglected  a</span><span>  golden  opportunity  of  setting  Ministers'</span><span>  on  the  right  track.  They  believed  the</span><span>  Land  Bill  essentially  bad,  and  instead  of</span><span>  taking  their  stand  firmly  on  principle,</span><span>  thought  fit  to  sacrifice  everything  to</span><span>  mere  expediency.  Their  argument  was</span><span>  ""  Let  us  not  give  the  Government  the</span><span>  ""  chance  of  taunting  us  with  throwing</span><span>  ""  out  their  iniquitous  measure,  but  let  us</span><span>  ""  make  it  as  innocuous  as  possible.""</span><span>  And  so  honorable  members  cut  and</span></p> <p><span>  patched  the  bill  until  it  was  impossible</span><span>  that  either  the  Government  or  Assembly</span><span>  could  accept  it.  The  result  is  that</span><span>  every  important  amendment  was  rejected</span><span>  by  the  Lower  House  as  summarily  as  it</span><span>  had  been  made  by  the  Upper,  and,  so</span><span>  far  as  the  land  question  is  concerned,  the</span><span>  Legislature  of  the  colony  has  been</span><span>  brought  to  a  deadlock.</span></p> <p><span>  But  to  come  to  Mr.  GREGORY'S  amend-  :</span><span>  ments.  He  first  dealt  with  the  inter-  ;</span></p> <p><span>  pretation  clause,  by  giving  a  very  |</span><span>  extended  meaning  to  the  term  ""improve-</span><span>  ments,""  and  by  providing  that  ""  fencing,""</span><span>  in  case  of  a  selector  holding  several</span><span>  blocks,  should  mean  a  fence  around  the</span><span>  whole,  and  not  around  each  block.  The</span><span>  latter  amendment,  to  use  the  words  of</span><span>  Mr.  STEPHENS,  ""  would  have  proved  a</span><span>  ""  neat  arrangement  for  dummying,""  and</span><span>  both  were  consequently  rejected.  On</span><span>  clause  9-the  resumption  clause-being</span><span>  proposed,  Mr.  WILSON  moved  that  it  be</span><span>  expunged.  Had  the  motion  been  agreed</span><span>  to,  the  bill  would  have  been  thrown  out,</span><span>  but  Mr.  GREGORY  came  to  the  rescue</span><span>  with  an  amendment  in  the  form  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  following  appendage  to  the  clause  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""In  addition  to  tho  right  of  pre-emption,</span><span>  which  may  be  exercised  under  tue  provisions</span><span>  of  the  Crown  Lands  Alienation  Act  of  1868,</span><span>  the  lesseo  may  make  further  selection  under</span><span>  pre-emption  to  the  extent  of  one-tenth  part  of</span><span>  the  area  held  under  lease  at  the  passing  of  this</span><span>  Act  in  compensation  for  such  resumption,  and</span><span>  such  pre-emptive  selection  to  bo  in  one  block,</span><span>  except  with  the  approval  of  the  commissioner</span><span>  for  the  consolidation  of  previous  selections,  and</span><span>  in  respect  to  the  annual  payments  thereon,  bc</span><span>  subject  to  tho  same  conditions  as  would  apply</span><span>  to  any  other  pre-emptive  selection  under  thc</span><span>  Act  of  1868.""</span></p> <p><span>  This  amendment  was  agreed  to  by  the</span><span>  Council,  but  on  being  submitted  to  the</span><span>  Assembly  was  rejected,  one  speaker-a</span><span>  licensed  surveyor-pointing  out  that  if</span><span>  this  clause  passed  [as  amended  the  lessee</span><span>  would  be  empowered  to  make  his</span><span>  pre-emptive  selections  in  six  separate</span></p> <p><span>  blocks.  The  amendment  was  con-</span><span>  sequently  ¿tísented  from  on  division</span><span>  by  twenty-three  ayes  to  six</span><span>  noes,-it  being  understood  that</span></p> <p><span>  several  of  the  majority,  while  anxious  to  ,</span><span>  see  the  principle  of  compensation</span><span>  affirmed,  could  not  vote  for  it  in  the</span><span>  shape  it  here  assumed.</span></p> <p><span>  The  next  important  amendment  was</span><span>  in  clause  io,  which  was  made  to  permit</span><span>  the  lessee  to  remove  improvements  from</span><span>  lands  in  cases  where  pre-emption  had</span><span>  been  exercised  elsewhere.  This  point</span></p> <p><span>  had  been  much  contested  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  Assembly,  Mr.  WIENHOLT  declaring  that</span><span>  he  would  ""remove  every  stick  of  irn</span><span>  ""  provements  from  his  run  in  spite  of  any</span><span>  ""  Act  to  the  contrary.""  Mr.  STEPHENS,</span><span>  however,  argued  that  where  a  lessee  had</span><span>  exercised  pre-emption  nominally  to  se-</span><span>  cure  improvements,  and  had  not  selected</span><span>  the  lands  on  which  they  stood,  he  had</span><span>  forfeited  all  right  and  title  to  them.  In</span><span>  this  opinion  the  majority  in  the  Assembly</span><span>  coincided,  and  their  views  were  not</span><span>  changed  when  Mr.  GREGORY'S  amend-</span><span>  ment  came  down  from  the  Upper</span></p> <p><span>  Chamber.</span></p> <p><span>  After  a  number  of  verbal  amendments,</span><span>  all  of  which  afterwards  met  the</span><span>  approval  of  the  Assembly,  Mr.  GREGORY</span><span>  moved  an  important  alteration  in  clause</span><span>  2i.  The  clause  originally  provided  that</span><span>  no  decision  of  the  land.  commissioner</span><span>  should  be  final  until  approved  of  by  the</span><span>  Secretary  for  Lands.  At  the  instance  of</span><span>  Mr.  GREGORY,  the  Council  added</span></p> <p><span>  ""Who  shall  within  six  months  notify  his</span><span>  confirmation  or  disallowance  thereof  ;  aud  if</span><span>  such  notification  bc  not  given  within  such</span><span>  period,  it  shall  bc  taken  that  thc  decision  of</span><span>  the  commissioner  has  been  confirmed.""</span></p> <p><span>  An  amendment  in  clause  23,  making</span></p> <p><span>  the  decisions  of  the  commissioners  final</span><span>  in  issuing  certificates,  was  also  made,  but</span><span>  both  the  concessions  having  been  stoutly</span><span>  contended  for  and  refused  previously  in</span><span>  tlie  Assembly,  were  unceremoniously  dis-</span><span>  agreed  to  when  inserted  by  the  Council.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  GRI:GORY*S  next  important  amend-</span><span>  ment  was  a  proviso  to  clause  25,  enact-</span><span>  ing  that  lands  should  not  be  open  to</span><span>  selection  under  this  Act  in  thc  unsettled</span><span>  districts,  except  ordered  by  a  resolution</span><span>  of  both  Houses  of  Parliament.  This  had</span><span>  been  a  great  subject  of  contention  in  the</span><span>  Assembly,  and  the  Government  having</span><span>  been  defeated  upon  it,  the  Council  should</span><span>  have  known  that  their  amendment  would</span><span>  not  be  agreed  to.  It  was,  in  fact,  re-</span><span>  jected  without  discussion.  An  amend-</span><span>  ment  in  clause  31  intended  to  limit  the</span><span>  area  for  selection  to  2560  acres,  shared</span><span>  the  same  fate  ;  and  one  in  clause  33,  con-</span><span>  fining  the  homestead  areas  to  one-tenth</span><span>  the  total  area  of  a  lease,  was  not  more</span><span>  fortunate.  Several  other  amendments  in</span><span>  matters  of  detail  were  also  disagreed  to,</span><span>  as  were  some  intended  to  prevent  the</span></p> <p><span>  proclamation  of  commons  in  agricultural  ]</span></p> <p><span>  districts.</span></p> <p><span>  The  remaining  amendments  were</span><span>  what  are  known  as  two  ""quieting  of</span><span>  titles  clauses.""  They  provided  that  in</span><span>  case  of  non-fulfilment  of  conditions  the</span><span>  deed  of  grant  might  be  obtained  on</span><span>  payment  of  a  penalty  of  five</span><span>  shillings  per  acre  ;  and  in  case</span></p> <p><span>  of  selections  held  under  the  Act  of</span><span>  1866,  that  improvements  might  be  sub-</span><span>  stituted  for  cultivation.  Both  these</span><span>  amendments  were  rejected  without  dis-</span><span>  cussion,  although  they  would  have  been</span><span>  a  great  relief  to  hundreds  of  poor  but</span><span>  bona  fide  selectors,  who  have  found</span><span>  it  impossible  to  fulfil  the  statutory  con-</span><span>  ditions  under  which  their  selections  were</span><span>  made.  Politicians  of  all  parties  admit</span><span>  that  sooner  or  later  a  ""selectors'  relief</span></p> <p><span>  bill""  must  be  passed,  but  it  does  not</span><span>  suit  the  Government  programme  to  grant</span><span>  this  relief  just  now.  Relief  to  the  bona</span><span>  fide  settler,  it  is  alleged,  would  also</span><span>  involve  immunity  to  the  great  dummier,</span><span>  and  that  it  is  not  intended  at  present  to</span><span>  concede.  But  persons  who  do  not  per-</span><span>  ceive  the  necessity  of  a  Liberal  Govern-</span><span>  ment  conserving  political  capital,  hold</span><span>  that  if  relief  be  inevitable  the  sooner  it  is</span><span>  afforded  the  better  for  the  poor  selector</span><span>  and  the  better  for  the  whole  colony.</span><span>  Nothing  is  more  detrimental  to  progress</span><span>  than  uncertainty  in  the  tenure  of  the</span><span>  land,  and  that  the  present  Government</span><span>  appear  determined  shall  become  the</span><span>  normal  condition  of  affairs  among  con-</span><span>  ditional  selectors  as  well  as  pastoral</span></p> <p><span>  lessees.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  telegrams  have  informed  us  that</span><span>  the  Land  Bill  has  been  finally  got  rid  of</span><span>  by  the  Government  carrying  a  motion  for</span><span>  reading  the  Council's  amendments  ""  that</span><span>  day  six  months,""  which  means  that  the</span><span>  bill  be  consigned  to  the  waste  paper</span><span>  basket-a  thing  not  to  be  regretted.  We</span></p> <p><span>  have  since  been  informed  that  some</span></p> <p><span>  resolutions  subsequently  passed  by  the</span><span>  Assembly,  for  resuming  certain  runs  for</span><span>  immediate  settlement,  have  also  been</span><span>  rejected  by  the  Council-a  circumstance</span><span>  to  be  deplored,  as  the  demand  for  land</span><span>  is  great  in  the  neighbourhood  of  all  thc</span><span>  principal  towns  in  the  colony.  The</span><span>  blame  for  this  state  of  affairs,  however,</span><span>  must  be  divided  between  the  Council</span><span>  and  the  Ministry  ;  for  if  the  former  be</span><span>  condemned  for  obstructing  settlement,</span><span>  the  latter  must  be  also  condemned  for</span><span>  approaching  the  question  of  resumption</span><span>  in  an  offensive  and  unconstitutional</span><span>  manner.  Had  resolutions  for  resuming</span><span>  lands  where  actually  required  been  sub-</span><span>  mitted  in  the  first  instance,  instead  of</span><span>  the  wholesale  resumption  designed  by</span><span>  the  Government  bill,  the  Council  could</span><span>  not  have  rejected  them  without  incurring</span><span>  very  grave  censure.  As  it  is,  they  claim</span><span>  sympathy  from  very  large  classes  in  the</span><span>  community  as  the  opponents  of  repu-</span><span>  diation,  or,  at  least,  of  inexpedient</span><span>  tampering  with  Crown  Lands  held  under</span></p> <p><span>  lease  by  the  pastoral  tenjiSl.  x  '</span></p> <p><span>  .-.-:</span></p> ",Article,1874-07-20,"The Rockhampton Bulletin, WITH WHICH IS INCORPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER.

The  pro-</span><span>  ceedings  commenced  by  the  MAYOR</span><span>  reading  out  the  list  of  candidates,</span><span>  and  throwing  aside  those  who  had</span><span>  no  supporters  in  the  Council.</span><span>  The  number  was  thus  reduced  to  eight,</span><span>  which  was  further  reduced  by  successive</span><span>  ballots,  from  eight  to  five,  five  to  three,</span><span>  three  to  two,  two  to  one-and  the  candi-</span><span>  date  who  in  the  last  ballot  polled  the</span><span>  largest  number  of  votes,  viz.,  seven,  was</span><span>  subsequently  elected  by  formal  resolu-</span><span>  tion.  In  the  first  ballot,  ALLEY,</span><span>  ROBERTSON,  and  EDGAR  each  polled</span><span>  tight  votes,  BURSTALL  seven,  MELCHIOR</span><span>  five,  and  each  of  the  others  a  less</span><span>  number.  The  five  named  were  then</span><span>  submitted  to  ballot  for  the  purpose  of</span><span>  reducing  the  number  to  three,  and  the</span><span>  outcome  was  as  follows  :-ALLEY  seven,</span><span>  EDGAR  six,  ROBERTSON  six,  BURSTALL</span><span>  five,  MELCHIOR  three.  The  two  last</span><span>  were  accordingly  thrown  aside.  The</span><span>  next  ballot  was  to  further  reduce  the</span><span>  number  to  two,  and  resulted  as  follows  :</span><span>  EDGAR  seven,  ALLEY  six,  ROBERTSON</span><span>  five.  The  choice  then  lay  between</span></p> <p><span>  i  /VI^LLÏ  ana  CDQAK,  ana  trie  votes  stood</span></p> <p><span>  respectively  seven  and  two.  It  is  a  note</span><span>  I  worthy  circumstance  that  whilst  ALLEY,</span></p> <p><span>  the  successfulcandidate,  polledse  ven  votes</span><span>  in  the  last  ballot  against  two  for  EDGAR,</span><span>  the  latter  polled  the  highest  number</span><span>  in  the  ballot  immediately  preceding.</span><span>  There  is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  the</span><span>  aldermen  had  altered  their  opinions,  and</span><span>  the  relative  change  of  position  of  the</span><span>  candidates  is  obviously  attributable  to</span><span>  the  manner  in  v/hich  thc  ballots  were</span><span>  .  taken.  In  a  siijiilar  way  we  find  that</span></p> <p><span>  BURSTALL,  «ho  hat?  five  aldermen  on</span></p> <p><span>  his  side,  and  in  no  instance  polled  less</span><span>  than  that  number  of  votes,  was  below</span><span>  three  of  the  other  candidates  when  the</span><span>  choice  was  made  of  three  out  of  five.</span></p> <p><span>  The  apparent  anomaly  is  capable  of  easy</span><span>  explanation.  In  the  ballot  for  three  out</span><span>  of  five,  the  aldermen  in  favour  of</span><span>  i  BURSTALL  were  required  to  vote  for  two</span></p> <p><span>  others  also;  and  although  they  were</span><span>  decided  as  to  their  man,  and  gave  him</span><span>  their  vote,  they  were  not  so  as  to  the  candi-</span><span>  dates  for  second  and  third  place  ;  and  in</span><span>  selecting  these,  scattered  their  votes  in</span><span>  such  a  capricious  manner  among  the  other</span><span>  four  as  to  give  a  larger  number  to  two</span><span>  of  them  than  to  their  own  favourite.</span><span>  This  curious  result,  it  will  be  clearly</span><span>  seen,  was  never  contemplated  by  the</span><span>  majority,  who  were,  in  fact,  defeated</span><span>  unintentionally  by  their  own  votes.  The</span><span>  same  mode  of  election  has  been  adopted</span><span>  for  some  time  past  in  the  Council,  and</span><span>  no  suspicion  ever  appears  to  have  crossed</span></p> <p><span>  the  minds  of  aldermen  that  from  the</span></p> <p><span>  very  nature  of  things  an  election  so  con-</span><span>  ducted  not  only  could  not  be  depended</span><span>  upon,  but  might  even  so  far  go  astray  as</span><span>  to  work  in  direct  opposition  to  the  wishes</span><span>  of  the  voters.  In  the  particular  instance</span><span>  before  us,  the  successful  candidate  could</span><span>  not  have  had  more  than  four  aldermen</span><span>  in  his  favour,  and  the  large  number  of</span><span>  votes  polled  by  him  was  mainly  due  to</span><span>  votes  that  were  indifferently  thrown  in</span><span>  by  the  several  aldermen  to  make  up  the</span><span>  required  numberin  t!;eirrespectivc  ballots.</span><span>  Each  Alderman,  we  will  suppose,  had  a</span><span>  preference  for  some  particular  candidate,</span></p> <p><span>  but  was  undecided  as  to  the  comparative  .</span><span>  merits  of  the  others.  In  this  way  the  j</span></p> <p><span>  objectless  votes  overpowered  those  given</span></p> <p><span>  with  definiteness  of  purpose.  We  are  ;</span><span>  not  canvassing  the  merits  of  the  candi-</span><span>  dates.  There  were,  doubtless,  several</span><span>  of  the  candidates  really  capable  and  suit-</span><span>  able  for  the  appointment  ;  and  we  make</span><span>  no  charge  against  the  winner,  who  is  a</span><span>  perfect  stranger  to  us,  and,  for  aught  we</span><span>  know,  to  the  contrary,  may  be  a  good</span></p> <p><span>  man.  It  is  nevertheless  true  that  he  has  ;</span><span>  been  chosen  in  error,  and  against  the  de-  ¡</span><span>  cided  intention  of  a  majority  of  j</span><span>  the  Council.  The  proper  course</span></p> <p><span>  would  have  been  to  submit  all</span></p> <p><span>  the  eligible  candidates  to  the  ballot  j</span></p> <p><span>  at  one  time.  Had  that  been  done,</span><span>  Mr.  BURSTALL  would  certainly  have</span></p> <p><span>  polled  five  votes,  whilst  no  other  i</span><span>  candidate  could  possibly  have  obtained  ;</span><span>  more  than  four,  and  it  is  not  improbable</span></p> <p><span>  that  the  accidental  votes  would  have  I</span><span>  been  so  distributed  as  to  allocate  less</span><span>  than  four  to  all  the  eleven  unsuccessful</span><span>  candidates.  However,  as  the  matter</span><span>  stands,  the  Council  wanted  Mr.  BURST-</span><span>  ALL,  but  against  their  own  will  and  in-</span></p> <p><span>  tention  elected  Mr.  AILEY.  The  rcso-1</span><span>  lution  by  which  the  appointment  was</span><span>  conferred  on  the  last-named  gentleman</span><span>  was  purely  of  a  formal  character,  and</span><span>  was  agreed  to  without  discussion,  the</span><span>  aldermen,  in  a  moment  of  surprise,</span><span>  being  under  the  erroneous  impression</span><span>  that  they  were  simply  giving  effect  to</span><span>  a  deliberate  decision  intelligently  arrived</span><span>  at  by  the  majority.</span></p> <p><span>  As  adjourned  sitting  of  the  Small  Debts</span><span>  Court  was  held  yesterday  before  the  Police</span><span>  Magistrate  and  his  worship  the  Mayor,  when</span><span>  the  case  of  Ash  Sing  e.

After  hearing  evidence  on</span><span>  both  aides,  and  the  addresses  of  the  attorneys</span><span>  engaged,  the  Court  gave  judgment  for  tho</span><span>  plaintiff  for  £1  17s.

The  restless</span><span>  anxiety  manifested  by  progressive  com-</span><span>  munities  to  grow  rich,  or  in  some  other</span><span>  way  to  attain  the  summit  of  human</span><span>  felicity,  is  perhaps  after  all  more</span><span>  defensible  than  the  life  of  mere  vegeta-</span><span>  tion  in  which  out  respected  ancestors</span><span>  delighted  to  exist,  as  a  set-off  against</span><span>  occasional  privations  and  sanguinary  ex-</span><span>  ploits,  lt  may  be  true  that  the</span><span>  intellectual  activity  and  assumed  physical</span><span>  deterioration  of  the  present  day  are  not</span><span>  without  their  disadvantages,  and  that,</span><span>  wliile  the  average  duration  of  human  life</span><span>  has  been  lengthened,  insanity  has  in-</span><span>  creased,  and  the  proportion  of  aged</span><span>  people  to  the  whole  population  has</span><span>  somewhat  diminished.  Yet  modern</span></p> <p><span>  existence  is  not  without  its  own</span><span>  liorations.  If  the  term  of  life  half</span><span>  teen  in  cases  shortened,  the  capacity  for</span><span>  «?»?enjoyment  has  been  enlarged,  ana  it!</span></p> <p><span>  opportunities  have  been  increased;  and</span><span>  although  death  is  not  robbed  of  its  terrors</span><span>  science  and  skill  have  done  something</span><span>  to  mitigate  the  suffering  attendant  upor</span><span>  disease,  especially  when  it  afflicts  the</span><span>  mind.  One  of  our  poets  tell  us</span></p> <p><span>  Th  ero  ia  pleasure,  sore,  in  being  mad,</span><span>  Which  none  but  madmen  know.</span></p> <p><span>  But  that  pleasure  must  have  been  of  ¡</span><span>  very  melancholy  kind  in  the  lunatic</span><span>  asylums  of  a  hundred  years  ago,  when</span><span>  chains,  manacles,  and  brutal  treatmen</span><span>  drove  incipient  madmen  to  despair,  and</span><span>  converted  hopeless  lunatics  into  fiends.</span></p> <p><span>  In  no  way  is  there  humanism;</span><span>  instincts  of  the  present  age  mon</span><span>  pleasingly  developed  than  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  treatment  of  the  insane.  Bru</span></p> <p><span>  tality  and  violence  have  been  re</span><span>  placed  by  sympathy  and  gentleness</span><span>  Chains,  manacles,  and  strait  jackets  have</span><span>  been  banished  in  favour  of  kindness  and</span><span>  careful  attention,  with  the  happiest  results</span><span>  and  the  friends  of  persons  afflicted  with</span><span>  mental  disorders  enjoy  the  consolation</span><span>  that  in  the  public  asylums  everything</span><span>  possible  is  done  to  promote  recovery,  not</span><span>  where  reason  is  hopelessly  gone,  be</span><span>  soothe  and  mitigate  the  wretchedness  of</span><span>  the  maniac's  condition.</span></p> <p><span>  In  Queenslandi  until  a  very  short  time</span><span>  ago,  our  treatment  of  the  insane  was</span><span>  cruel.  We  had  an  asylum  at  Woogaroo</span><span>  but  it  was  conducted  on,  the  old  coerciv</span><span>  system.  Refractory'  lunatics:  were  treated</span><span>  in  the  most  approved'  methods  of  re</span><span>  pression.  Even  women  were  caged.</span><span>  Chained  to  rings  in  the  floor,  handcuffed</span><span>  and  leg-ironed,  and  cruelly  beaten  into</span><span>  docility,  or  rather  exhaustion.  They</span><span>  entered  the  asylum  through  the  gaol'</span><span>  and  generally  speaking  were  treated  like</span><span>  furious  wild  beasts,  instead  of  human</span><span>  beings  afflicted  with  mental  disorders.  No</span><span>  doubt  the  cruelty  was  not  intentional,  an</span><span>  the  repression  was  no  more  than  media</span><span>  men  deemed  necessary  for  the  protection</span><span>  both  of  the  lunatic  and  his  keepers</span><span>  But  that  such  violence  was  really</span><span>  unnecessary  is  proven  by  the  succèss</span><span>  which  attends  the  present  humane  treat</span><span>  ment,  and  by  the  immunity  with  which</span><span>  two  or  three  warders  move  about</span><span>  amongst  dozens  of  confirmed  maniacs.</span></p> <p><span>  The  lunatic  asylum  at  Woogaroo  is</span><span>  becoming  an  institution  of  some</span><span>  magnitude.  It  is,  in  fact,  a  collection  <</span><span>  some  270  mad  people,  who  with  the</span><span>  warders  in  charge  out  number  the  population</span><span>  of  many  a  bush  township.  With</span><span>  its  convalescent  and  refractory  wards</span><span>  cells,  dormitories  and  hospitals,  for  both</span><span>  male  and  female  patients,  Woogaroo  is  a</span></p> <p><span>  place  which  the  visitor  requires  consid</span><span>  able  time  lo  inspect  In  thc  surgery  he</span><span>  discovers  a  tolerably  complete  chemist</span></p> <p><span>  shop.  Tossing  into  the  male  refractory</span><span>  wards,  he  finds  himself  suddenly  in  the</span><span>  company  of  some  fifty  or  sixty  men  in  all</span><span>  stages  of  lunacy,  but  perfectly  free  from</span><span>  implements  of  restraint  or  torture,  and</span><span>  each  pursuing  the  vagaries  of  his  own</span><span>  perverted  fancy.  Here  is  a  perfect</span><span>  bedlam  of  noise.  One  howls,  another</span><span>  sings,  a  third  preaches,  a  fourth  pro-</span><span>  menades  with  thc  regularity  of  a  sentry,</span><span>  a  fifth  runs  or  jumps,  a  sixth  plays</span><span>  childishly  with  rags  or  bones,  while</span><span>  others  sit  or  repose  at  full  length  on  the</span><span>  ground,  looking  about  with  dreamy</span><span>  vacuity.  The  first  idea  of  thc  visitor  is</span></p> <p><span>  that  some  four  or  five  warders  must  be</span><span>  insufficient  for  the  proper  control  of  so</span><span>  large  a  number  of  dangerous  madmen,</span><span>  but  the  business  appears  to  be  conducted</span><span>  without  fear  or  difficulty.  livery  patient</span><span>  is  an  isolated  wreck  of  humanity-a</span><span>  practically  solitary  individual  although</span><span>  actually  in  a  crowd-perfectly  indifferent</span><span>  to  and  apparently  unconscious  of  the</span><span>  doings  of  his  companions.  A  concerted</span><span>  attack  is  therefore  impossible,  and  the  ¡</span><span>  warders  are  always  able  to  concentrate</span><span>  their  strength  upon  a  patient  when  the</span><span>  violent  paroxysm  comes  on.  ^  The</span><span>  keepers  are  calm  and  systematic  in  their</span><span>  movements,  and  exercise  full  control</span><span>  over  the  incoherent  mass  of</span><span>  human  beings  by  whom  they  arc</span><span>  surrounded.  The  sight  of  these</span><span>  unhappy  people  is,  however,  most</span><span>  melancholy  and  depressing  to  the  un-</span><span>  seasoned  visitor,  and  he  gladly  passes  on</span><span>  to  inspect  other  portions  of  the  institu-</span><span>  tion.  Adjacent  to  the  refractory  ward</span><span>  he  notices  some  dark  cells,  where  other-</span><span>  wise  unmanageable  patients  are  ""occa-</span><span>  sionally  placed,  it  being  found  that</span><span>  darkness  soothes  the  diseased  mind  as</span><span>  well  as  the  diseased  eye.  In  the  con</span><span>  valescent  ward  everything  is  in  marked</span><span>  contrast  to  that  just  left.  Here  every-</span><span>  thing  is  quiet,  orderly,  and  conducive  to</span><span>  the  patients'  recovery.  The  dormitories</span><span>  are  a  picture  of  neatness,  and,  so  far  as</span><span>  the  space  available  admits,  thc  inmates</span><span>  are  provided  with  all  requisites  for  health</span><span>  and  comfort.  The  hospital  ward  is</span><span>  fairly  adapted  for  the  purpose,  and</span><span>  although  here  the  visitor  is  sickened</span><span>  by  meeting  patients  shattered  both</span><span>  in  body  and  mind,  there  is  some</span><span>  comfort  in  the  thought  that  the  poor</span><span>  creatures  receive  all  the  care  which</span><span>  their  deplorable  condition  demands.</span><span>  The  female  wards  require  more  fortitude</span><span>  for  proper  inspection  than  the  usual  run</span><span>  of  visitors  can  command.  It  is  revolting</span><span>  enough  to  pass  through  the  male  refrac-</span><span>  tory  ward,  but  recollections  of  the</span><span>  violent  ravings  of  lunatics  of  the  ""  gen-</span><span>  tler  sex  ""  would  be  too  disagreeable  a</span><span>  reminiscence  in  the  visitor's  mind  to  make</span><span>  .  the  inspection  of  the  female  wards  a  matter</span></p> <p><span>  of  choice.  It  may  be  deemed  some</span><span>  satisfaction,  however,  when  we  state  that</span><span>  the  female  lunatics,  both  refractory  and</span><span>  convalescent,  are  attended  upon  solely  by</span><span>  women,  and  that  no  degree  of  violence</span><span>  on  the  part  of  an  inmate  is  held  to</span><span>  warrant  the  calling  in  of  a  male  warder.</span></p> <p><span>  The  institution  is  in  charge  of  Dr.</span><span>  JAAP,  who  is  not  only  an  experienced</span><span>  surgeon,  but  also  an  enthusiast  in  his</span><span>  work.  He  resides  with  his  family  on</span><span>  the  grounds,  and  is  always  within  call,</span><span>  by  day  or  night.  His  responsibilities  are</span><span>  very  great,  and  his  duties  have  proved  so</span><span>  severe  and  unremitting  that  it  has  just</span><span>  been  found  necessary  to  appoint  an  assis-</span><span>  tant-surgeon.  Ufortunately,  the  number  of</span><span>  patients  Ls  steadily  increasing,  and  in</span><span>  consequence  new  and  improved  buildings</span><span>  ,  have  been  for  some  time  in  progress.  In</span><span>  a  few  months,  it  is  hoped  that  these  will</span><span>  have  been  completed,  and  the  insititution</span><span>  placed  in  a  thoroughly  effective  state.</span><span>  The  question,  however,  arises  whether</span><span>  Woogaroo,  with  some  three  hundred</span><span>  lunatics  within  its  grounds,  is  not  large</span><span>  enough  for  a  single  establishment  of  that</span><span>  nature,  and  whether  a  second  asylum,</span><span>  either  on  the  Darling  Downs  or  at  some</span><span>  place  in  the  northern  districts,  should  not</span><span>  as  soon  as  practicable  be  commenced.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  question  arises  in  regard  to</span><span>  the  treatment  of  the  insane,  on  which</span><span>  the  ""authorities""  differ.  Dr.  JAAP,  for</span><span>  example,  is  sceptical  of  the  benefit</span><span>  derived  from  the  several  lunatic  recep-</span><span>  tion  houses,  and  strongly  disapproves  oí</span><span>  the  discretionary  power  given  to  magis-</span><span>  trates  to  re-commit  patients  for  a  second</span><span>  or  third  month's  treatment  to  those</span><span>  institutions.  He  argues  that  at  Woogaroo</span><span>  are  incomparably  the  best  appliances  for</span><span>  the  treatment  of  dementia,  which  is  a</span><span>  diSorderdemanding  prompt  and  energetic</span><span>  treatment.  He  contends  therefore  that</span><span>  dipsomaniacs  alone  should  be  retained  in</span><span>  the  reception  houses,  and  that  all  other</span><span>  patients  should  be  forwarded  at  once</span><span>  to  Woogaroo.  The  percentage  of  cures</span><span>  effected  at  that  institution  has  been</span><span>  steadily  declining  for  years  past,  until</span><span>  it  now  stands  at  some  22  or  23  per  cent</span><span>  of  the  numbers  admitted.  Years  ago  the</span><span>  percentage  of  recoveries  was  very  much</span><span>  greater,  and  as  Surgeon-superintendent,</span><span>  Dr.  JAAP  naturally  looks  upon  his  un-</span><span>  favourable  returns  with  anxiety.  The</span><span>  buildings,  appliances,  and  mode  of  treat-</span><span>  ment  have  of  late  years  been  greatly</span><span>  improved,  and  to  the  casual  observer  it</span><span>  may  seem  remarkable  that  thc  percentage</span><span>  of  cures  has  so  greatly  declined.</span><span>  Woogaroo  is,  in  fact,  rapidly  becoming  an</span><span>  institution  for  incurables,  and  almost  all</span><span>  the  medical  staff  and  warders  can  hope</span><span>  for  is  some  amelioration  of  the  state  of</span><span>  unfortunates  as  dead  to  society  and  the</span><span>  world  as  though  they  were  in  their</span><span>  graves.  This  is  less  satisfactory  in  some</span><span>  respects  titan  a  higher  percentage  of</span><span>  cures  would  be;  but  there  is  another</span><span>  side  to  the  question.  At  the  lunatic</span><span>  reception  house  in  Rockhampton,  for</span><span>  example,  the  accommodation,  in  propor-</span><span>  tion  to  the  number  of  patients,  is  not</span><span>  inferior  to  Woogaroo,  and  it  possesses</span><span>  the  advantage  of  not  being  regarded  as</span><span>  a  public  madhouse.  A  person  of</span><span>  unsound  mind,  when  committed  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  I  lunatic  reception  house  knows-if  he</span><span>  have  any  glimmering  of  reason  left</span><span>  that  it  is  a  place  of  temporary  detention</span><span>  only,  and  that  he  goes  there  as  an</span><span>  invalid  for  medical  treatment  rather</span><span>  than  as  a  patient  to  a  lunatic</span><span>  asylum.  Dr.  J  AIM-  makes  tallier</span><span>  hght  of  this  aspect  of  the  matter,</span><span>  but,  some  of  his  professional  brctliren</span></p> <p><span>  hold  a  contrary  opinion,  and  maintain  it</span><span>  with  all  die  firmness  usually  displayed  by</span><span>  j  doctors  who  disagree.  At  Brisbane,</span><span>  Dr.  Houns,  who  has  charge  of  the</span><span>  lunatic  reception  house  there,  sends  a</span><span>  patient  to  Woogaroo  only  as  a  last</span><span>  resource  when  convinced  that  the  case</span><span>  is  incurable.  Dr.  SALMOND  here,  also</span><span>  takes  up  much  the  same  ground,  and  he</span><span>  is  scarcely  less  an  enthusiast  in  the</span><span>  matter  titan  Dr.  J  AAP  himself.  What-</span><span>  ever  might  be  the  correct  practice  at</span><span>  Brisbane,  which  is  within  a  few  miles  of</span><span>  Woogaroo,  it  seems  obviously  desirable</span><span>  to  retain  patients  in  the  lunatic  reception</span><span>  house  here  so  long  as  there  is  hope  of</span><span>  cure  and  the  institution  is  not  over-</span><span>  crowded.  The  costof  transit  to  Brisbane</span></p> <p><span>  is  considerable,  and  the  roughing  it  in</span><span>  charge  of  a  constable  on  board  steamer</span><span>  canscarcelybe  conducive  to  apaticnt's  re-</span><span>  covery.  This  argument  applies  with  still</span><span>  greater  force  at  Townsville,  and  if  the</span><span>  result  of  establishing  lunatic  reception</span><span>  houses  at  all  the  chief  centres  of  popula-</span><span>  tion  in  the  colony,  tends  to  still  further</span></p> <p><span>  1  reduce  the  nercentace  of  cures  at  Woo</span></p> <p><span>  garoo,  compensation  must  be  found  in</span><span>  the  probability  that,  by  timely  measures</span><span>  on  the  spot,  incipient  mania  is  often</span><span>  checked  and  mental  health  restored</span><span>  where  delay  would  be  attended  by  un-</span><span>  favourable  symptoms.  Anyone  who  has</span><span>  visited  both  Woogaroo  and  the  lunatic</span><span>  reception  house  at  Rockhampton,  would</span><span>  certainly  not  hesitate  as  to  which  he  pre-</span><span>  ferred  for  an  afflicted  friend  of  whose</span><span>  recovery  there  was  some  ground  for</span><span>  hope.  Despite  the  many  advantages  of</span><span>  treatment  at  Woogaroo,  wc  think  our</span><span>  medical  men  are  quite  justified  in</span><span>  keeping  patients  out  of  that  institution</span><span>  as  long  as  possible.  A  sick  man  who</span><span>  would  not  suffer  depression  on  entering</span><span>  that  place  must  be  very  far  gone  indeed,</span><span>  and  not  even  Dr.  JAAP  will  argue  that</span><span>  mental  depression  in  cases  of  lunacy  is</span><span>  conducive  to  convalescence.  ?,<</span></p> ",Article,1874-09-03,"The Rockhampton bulletin, WITH WHICH IS INCORPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER PUBLISHED DAILY.

It  is,  however,  on  the  whole,</span><span>  a  satisfactory  record  of  progress  in</span><span>  electric  telegraphy  in  this  colony,  and</span><span>  contains  a  variety  of  information  of</span><span>  general  interest.</span></p> <p><span>  The  work  of  extension  is  still  going  on</span><span>  in  this  department  as  is  shown  by  the</span><span>  list  of  new  lines  and  additional  wires</span><span>  erected  since  the  date  of  Mr.  CRACK</span><span>  NEU.'S  last  report  They  are  as  follows:</span><span>  -From  Maryborough  to  Teningering,</span><span>  new  line,  48  miles;  Maryborough  to</span><span>  Gayndah,  additional  wire,  25  miles  ;  Gin</span><span>  Gin  toGladstone.newline,  i04miles  ;  Too-</span><span>  woomba  to  Dalby  (railway  line  of  three</span><span>  wires),  52  miles  ;  Gin  Gin  to  Bundaberg,</span><span>  new  line,  30  v£  miles  ;  Springsure  to</span><span>  Tambo,  144J/¿  miles;  and  Brisbane  to</span><span>  Maryborough,  second  wire,  177y2  miles.</span><span>  In  the  colony  there  are  altogether  3203</span><span>  miles  of  line,  and  3931  miles  of  wire,</span><span>  which  are  worked  by  181  officers  at  74</span><span>  stations.

This  is  exclusive  of  O.H.M.S.</span><span>  business,  which  is  equal  to  about  one</span><span>  third  of  the  cash  business.  The  popu-</span><span>  lation  of  the  colony  in  1863  was  61,640,</span><span>  and  in  1873,  146,690,  so  that  the  tele-</span><span>  graphic  business  is  extending  far  more</span><span>  rapidly  than  the  population  is  increasing.</span></p> <p><span>  The  lines  at  present  in  course  of  con-</span><span>  traction  are,-from  Roma  to  Charleville,</span><span>  180  miles,  where  150  miles  of  poles</span><span>  have  been  erected,  and  the  work  is</span><span>  generally  in  a  forward  state  ;  and  from</span><span>  Roma  to  St  George,  120  miles,  to  bc</span><span>  completed  al  the  end  of  the  year</span><span>  Arrangements  have  also  been  entercc</span><span>  into  for  erecting  a  second  wire  on  tin</span></p> <p><span>  line  between  Rockhampton  and  the</span><span>  Burdekin,  493  miles,  the  single  wire</span><span>  between  tírese  points  being  much  over</span><span>  crowded,  and  business  being  greatly</span><span>  obstructed  by  the  stoppages  which  some-</span><span>  times  occur.  Tenders  have  also  been</span><span>  invited  for  the  construction  of  lines  from</span><span>  Brisbane  to  Nerang  Creek,  near  the</span><span>  Border  ;  from  Brisbane  to  Ipswich,</span><span>  within  the  railway  fences;  and  from</span></p> <p><span>  Ravenswood  to  Millchester.

Meteorological  observations  also</span><span>  continue  to  be  taken  at  Cape  Moreton,</span><span>  Toowoomba,  and  Warwick,  and  for-</span><span>  warded  daily  to  Brisbane.  But  why  such</span></p> <p><span>  observations  are  not  taken  in  other  j</span><span>  parts  of  the  colony,  and  transmitted  daily</span><span>  to  Brisbane,  with  the  rainfall,  Dr.</span><span>  CRACKNELL  does  not  explain.  To</span><span>  relieve  the  pressure  from  this  free</span><span>  business,  he  suggests  that  shipping</span><span>  should  be  forwarded  at  Press  rates,  but</span><span>  he  does  not  say  who  is  to  pay  for  them,</span><span>  as  the  public  expect  such  intelligence  to</span><span>  be  posted  daily  on  receipt,  and  could  not</span><span>  be  satisfied  to  await  the  issue  of  the  next</span><span>  local  paper.</span></p> <p><span>  In  referring  to  the  ""  working  of  lines,""</span><span>  the  report  reminds  us  that  serious  damage</span><span>  was  done  to  the  lines  between  Hawkwood</span><span>  and  Camboon,  and  between  Mary-</span><span>  borough  and  Gayndah,  by  heavy  storms</span><span>  and  bush  fires  in  November  last  ;  and</span><span>  that  the  cyclone  in  January  injured  many</span><span>  miles  of  the  line  between  St  Lawrence</span><span>  arid  Nebo.  On  the  whole,  however,  we</span><span>  are  assured  that  the  lines  worked  well</span></p> <p><span>  throughout  the  year-an  assurance  which</span></p> <p><span>  we  cannot  accept  without  some  qualifica-  j</span></p> <p><span>  tion.  It  would  have  been  of  course  unrea-</span><span>  sonable  to  expect  Mr.  CRACKNELUO  admit</span><span>  that  owing  to  his  own  want  of  foresight,  or</span><span>  obstinacy,  telegraphic  communication</span><span>  was  nearly  brought  to  a  deadlock  for</span><span>  months  after  the  reduction  in  charges</span><span>  last  November.  Messages  were  re-</span><span>  ceived,  it  is  true,  at  the  different  stations,</span><span>  but  so  inadequate  was  the  staff  to  trans-</span><span>  act  the  increased  business,  that  their</span><span>  transmission  ordinarily  occupied  days,</span><span>  instead  of  minutes  or  hours.  It  is  well</span><span>  known  that  until  October  the  Superin-</span><span>  tendent  took  no  measures  to  prepare  for</span><span>  the  flood  of  business  which  he  ought  to</span><span>  have  anticipated  and  prepared  for.  We</span><span>  now  are  told  that  for  the  sue  months</span><span>  preceding  the  réduction),  the  number</span><span>  of  messages  transmitted  was  58,542,</span><span>  while  for  the  succeeding  six  months  the</span><span>  number  was  96,130  or  an  increase</span><span>  of  65  per  cent.  The  former  brought  in</span><span>  £10,700,  and  the  latter  £9692,  so  that</span><span>  the  loss  of  revenue,  notwithstanding  the</span><span>  reduced  charges  and  the  continual  delays</span><span>  in  transmission,  shows  a  loss  of  only</span><span>  £2000  a-year.  A  better  justification  for</span><span>  the  reduction,  in  spite  of  Mr.  CRACK</span><span>  NELL'S  protests,  could  hardly  be  supplied.</span><span>  It  will  no  doubt  be  found  that  the</span><span>  receipts  for  the  current  year  will  largely</span><span>  exceed  any  previous  one  ;  and  although</span><span>  the  expenditure  will  be  considerably</span><span>  increased,  the  public  will  have  gained  a</span><span>  large  indirect  return  by  the  reduced</span><span>  charges.</span></p> <p><span>  After  referring  to  various  matters  of</span><span>  minor  interest,  the  report  explains  what</span><span>  has  been  done  in  regard  to  the  cable</span><span>  proposed  to  be  laid  between  Normanton</span><span>  and  Singapore,  the  construction  of  which</span><span>  was  agreed  upon  at  the  Intercolonial</span><span>  Conference  held  in  February  last  year.</span><span>  The  proposal  has  since  been  assented  to</span><span>  by  the  Legislatures  of  New  South  Wales,</span><span>  New  Zealand,  and  Queensland,  and  we</span><span>  are  glad  to  be  informed  that  steps  will  be</span></p> <p><span>  taken  to  commence  the  work  without</span></p> <p><span>  delay.  We  may  remind  the  reader  that</span><span>  the  project  includes  the  laying  of  a  cable</span><span>  between  Sydney  and  New  Zealand,  and</span><span>  that  the  enterprise  will  be  carried  out  at</span><span>  the  joint  expense  of  the  three  colonies.</span></p> <p><span>  There  are  several  appendices  to  the</span><span>  report,  supplying  details  on  various,</span><span>  matters  connected  with  the  department.</span><span>  A  map  showing  the  telegraph  lines  con-</span><span>  structed  or  proposed  between  Europe</span><span>  and  Australia  is  also  attached,  and  gives</span><span>  the  reader  valuable  information  with</span><span>  respect  to  the  extension  of  international</span><span>  telegraphy.</span></p> <p><span>  Tile  revenue  collected  at  the  Customs,</span><span>  Rockhampton,  during  thc  month  of  June,</span><span>  amounted  to  £5G4I  fis.  2d.

MAY  9,  1874.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  understand  that  the  members  of</span><span>  Parliament  in  this  colony  are  much  dis-</span><span>  satisfied  at  the  very  curt  manner  in  which</span><span>  their  speeches  have  been  lately  reported</span><span>  -often  distorted-in  the  public  Press.</span><span>  The  leading  journal  limits  its  Parlia-</span><span>  mentary  reports  to  four  or  five  columns</span><span>  per  diem,  a  space  quite  adequate  on  some</span><span>  days,  but  utterly  insufficient  when  any</span><span>  important  question  is  under  considera-</span><span>  tion.  It  is  quite  certain  that  public</span><span>  opinion  has  heretofore  been  formed</span><span>  mainly  upon  the  Parliamentary  debates</span><span>  published  in  the  daily  Press,  but  with  such</span><span>  reports  as  are  now  supplied,  it  is  prac-</span><span>  tically  the  editors  of  newspapers,  rather</span><span>  than  the  members  of  the  Legislature,  who</span><span>  form  public  opinion  in  this  colony.  This</span><span>  state  of  affairs  no  doubt  exalts  the  func-</span><span>  tion  of  journalism,  but  in  a  colony  like</span><span>  ours,  whose  immense  geographical  ex</span><span>  tent  necessarily  involves  a  great  diversity</span><span>  of  opinions  and  interests,  it  is  impossible</span><span>  for  any  individual  journal  to  satisfactorily</span><span>  reflect  public  opinion  in  ¡ts  various</span><span>  forms.  The  editor  of  thc  Courier  is</span><span>  actuated  by  thc  most  honourable  inten-</span><span>  tions,  but  he  finds  it  will  not  pay  to</span><span>  report  the  debates  in  full,  and  Üierefbre</span><span>  exercises  discretion  as  to  what  shall  be</span></p> <p><span>  published  and  what  suppressed.  The  I</span><span>  consequence  is  that  some  discussions</span><span>  of  the  greatest  possible  interest  to  the</span><span>  central  and  northern  districts  are  not</span><span>  published  at  all,  while  matters  of  su-</span><span>  preme  but  purely  local  interest  to</span><span>  the  southern,  districts  are  accorded</span><span>  a  liberal  quantity  of  space.  Hansard  is</span><span>  intended,  as  an  historical  record  merely,</span><span>  and  therefore  reports  in  Committee  of</span><span>  the-  Whole,  where  some  of  the  best</span><span>  speeches,  on  current  topics  are  made,</span><span>  are  not  in  any  way  preserved.  On</span><span>  reference  to  the  number  of  Hansard  just</span><span>  to  hand,  however,  we  find  that  portion</span><span>  'of  the  debate  in  Committee  of  Supply</span><span>  'which  refers  to  Mr.  Stanley  is  preserved,</span><span>  while  no  notice  is  taken  of  the  remon-</span><span>  strances  of  the  members  for  the  central</span><span>  district  on  thc  road  and  postal  votes,</span><span>  or  of  the  discussion  which  took  place  on</span><span>  the  roads  department  at  Rockhampton.</span><span>  So  that  the  only  account  of  these</span><span>  matters  that  has  been  preserved,</span><span>  is  the  meagre  notice  and  bald</span><span>  comment  which  appeared  in  the</span><span>  so-called  report  of  the  Brisbane  Courier.</span><span>  It  is  not  unnatural,  therefore,  that  a</span><span>  change  in  the  method  of  preparing</span><span>  Ratuard  is  under  consideration,  and  that</span><span>  failing  the  dissemination  of  reasonably</span><span>  correct  and  full  reports  by  private  enter-</span><span>  prise,  arrangements  will  probably  bc</span><span>  made  for  the  publication  of  authenti-</span><span>  cated  reports  by  the  Legislature  itself.</span><span>  The  project  has,  in  fact,  been  mooted  of</span><span>  publishing  a  Morning  Mamari,  contain-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  not  more  than  fourteen  newspaper  ;</span><span>  columns  of  authentic  reports  prepared</span><span>  by  thc  Parliamentary  staff.  This  sheet,</span><span>  it  is  further  suggested,  should  be</span><span>  issued  at  a  nominal  price  per  hundred</span><span>  or  thousand  to  all  newspaper  pro-</span><span>  prietors  for  thc  purpose  of  cir-</span><span>  culating  with  their  ordinary  issues.</span><span>  Were  this  proposal  adopted,  the  electors</span><span>  of  all  parts  of  the  colony  would  bc</span><span>  placed  in  a  position  to  judge  of  the</span><span>  opinions  and  capability  of  their  repre</span><span>  I  sentatives,  and  a  means  of  education</span></p> <p><span>  provided  which  must  tend  to  dissipate!</span><span>  '  thc  too  prevailing  ignorance  on  political  I</span></p> <p><span>  subjects.  As  now  published,  Hansard</span><span>  is  useless  in  forming  public  opinion,</span></p> <p><span>  ^  but  if  issued  contemporaneously  willi  the.</span></p> <p><span>  daily  Press,  its  value  would  be  greatly</span><span>  increased.  There  would  be  no  necessity</span><span>  to  preserve  all  the  speeches  in  permanent</span><span>  form  of  Hansard,  as  all  matters  of  merely</span><span>  temporary  interest  might  bc  elimi-</span><span>  nated  after  circulation  in  tho  daily</span><span>  form.  Another  suggestion  is  that</span><span>  tenders  be  called  for  publication  of</span><span>  the  Parliamentary  debates  in  connection</span><span>  with  one  of  the  public  journals.  This</span><span>  plan  would  result  in  a  large  saving  of</span><span>  expense,  and  it  is  said  to  have  been</span><span>  already  adopted  with  marked  success  in</span><span>  South  Australia.  The  objection  to  it  in</span><span>  this  colony  seems  to  be  that  the  pro-</span><span>  prietors  of  the  Brisbane  Courier  would</span><span>  be  the  only  tenderers  for  such  work,  and</span><span>  that  they  would  in  consequence  secure</span><span>  a  practical  monopoly  at  their  own  price.</span><span>  A  third  method  suggested  is  that  the</span><span>  Parliamentary  reporting  staff  should  be</span><span>  increased  so  as  to  furnish  thc  proprietors</span><span>  of  the  Cottrttfr  with  a  given  number  of</span><span>  columns  of  ""  ropy  ""  each  night.  Hy  this</span><span>  arrangement  the  Courier  would  be  able</span><span>  to  dispense  with  its  Parliamentary  staff,</span></p> <p><span>  and  be  able  to  furnish  more  extended</span></p> <p><span>  reports  than  is  found  practicable  at</span><span>  present.  But  this,  too,  would  give  the</span><span>  Charier  a  monopoly,  and  would  bc  more</span><span>  expensive  than  the  existing  method.</span></p> <p><span>  The  best  plan,  therefore,  would  evidently  ¡</span><span>  be  to  employ  a  competent  and  inde-j</span><span>  pendent  Parliamentary  reporting  staff,  and  j</span><span>  have  Kantard  issued  every  morning  from</span><span>  theGovcrnmcnt.priiiting  office,  which  lias</span><span>  all  the  appliances  requisite  for  the</span><span>  work.  We  should  think  newspaper</span><span>  proprietors  would  only  bc  too  glad  to</span><span>  purchase  such  sheets  by  wholesale  as</span><span>  suggested,  and  so  give  their  readers  the</span><span>  benefit  of  authorised  and  full  reports.</span><span>  To  say  that  the  plan  has  never  been</span><span>  adopted  elsewhere,  is  no  good  argument</span><span>  against  it,  for  elsewhere  private  enter-</span><span>  prise  supplies  the  public  with  full  and</span><span>  accurate  reports  of  the  parliamentary</span><span>  debates.  It  is  not  to  be  endured  that,</span><span>  because  thc  Brisbane  journal  chooses  to</span><span>  suppress  the  parliamentary  reports,  the</span><span>  public  should  bc  deprived  of  the  mass  of</span><span>  useful  information  contained  in  them.</span></p> <p><span>  They  contain  much  chaff,  no  doubt,  but</span><span>  they  have  also  too  much  grain  in  them</span><span>  to  be  thrown  aside  as  so  much  rubbish.</span></p> ",Article,1874-05-09,"The Rockhampton Bulletin, WITH WHICH IS INCORPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER.

Beyond  a.  passing</span><span>  remark  disapproving  of  some  ol""  ils  pro-</span><span>  visions,  however,  we  did  not  pronounce</span><span>  upon  llie  measure,  preferring  that  thc</span></p> <p><span>  reader  should  be  allowed  to  form  his</span><span>  own  conclusions.  Tho  Press  elsewhere</span><span>  seems  to  have  been  actuated  by  a  similar</span><span>  intention,  but  this  course  has  not  proved</span><span>  of  assistance  to  thc  author  of  the  bill.</span><span>  The  measure  is,  in  fact,  condemned  on</span><span>  every  side,  and  it  seems  to  be  without  a</span><span>  single  friend  beyond  two  or  three  thick</span><span>  and-thin  supporters  of  the  Government</span><span>  who  happen  to  be  identified  with  the</span><span>  small  farmers  of  East  Moreton  and</span><span>  of  tlie  environs  of  Toowoomba.</span><span>  So  universal  a  condemnation  of  an  impor-</span><span>  tant  Government  measure  has  seldom</span></p> <p><span>  been  witnessed,  and  therefore  we  are  j</span></p> <p><span>  bound  to  tender  to  its  author  our  heartfelt  i</span><span>  commiseration.  So  far  as  the  Ministry  i</span><span>  is  concerned,  however,  thc  fate  of  the</span><span>  bill  is  not  of  much  consequence.  They</span><span>  have  not,  it  is  declared,  the  remotest</span><span>  intention  of  standing  by  it,  and  conse-</span><span>  quently  no  apprehension  need  be  enter-</span><span>  tained  of  their  possible  fall.  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  STEPHENS  was  ever  a  sturdy  opponent  of</span><span>  Mr.  LAMH,  the  unhappy  Secretary  for</span><span>  Lands  when  the  Act  of  1868  was  passed,</span><span>  and  no  one  professed  to  feel  a  more</span><span>  patriotic  contempt  for  thc  incapacity  of</span></p> <p><span>  that  unfortunate  Minister  than  did  the</span></p> <p><span>  gentleman  who  now  wears  his  long  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  carded  mantle.  But  Mr.  STEPHENS</span><span>  finds  that  Mr.  LAMB  did  one</span><span>  wisc  thing  at  least  during  his  tenn  of</span><span>  office.  He  made  a  precedent  for  throw-</span><span>  ing  a  land  bill  upon  thc  table  of  the</span><span>  House,  and  leaving  it  there  for  hon.</span><span>  members  to  worry  to  their  hearts'  con-</span><span>  tent.  Mr.  STEPHENS  therefore,  although</span><span>  a  thorough-going  radical,  has  determined</span><span>  to  take  advantage  of  this  useful  prece-</span><span>  dent,  and,  we  arc  assured,  will  not  stake</span><span>  his  reputation,  much  less  the  existence</span><span>  of  his  government,  upon  a  single  prin-</span><span>  ciple  contained  in  hts  precious  bill.</span><span>  This,  on  the  whole,  is  perhaps  fortunate</span><span>  for  thc  country,  as  one  at  least  of  Mr.</span><span>  STEPHENS'  colleagues  is  somewhat</span><span>  tainted  with  squaltocratic  prejudices</span><span>  and  even  disinclined  to  go  as</span><span>  far  in  thc  direction  of  ""  Liberality  ""</span><span>  as  several  gentlemen  who  occupy  the</span><span>  Opposition  benches,  and  who,  by  courtesy</span><span>  are  termed  Conservative  politicians.</span><span>  The  PREMIER,  too,  although  a  popu-</span><span>  larity  seeker,  is  not  by  any  means  a  land</span><span>  reformer  of  the  cabbage  garden  stamp,</span><span>  and  it  is  believed  will  not  support  the</span><span>  new  bill  further  titan  decorum  compels</span><span>  him  to  do  so.  Thus  the  measure  will</span><span>  have  lo  be  abandoned  to  its  fate,  and  if</span><span>  il  ever  find  a  place  in  our  statute  book,</span><span>  will  be  so  disfigured  as  to  be  scarcely</span><span>  recognisable  as  thc  offspring  of  the</span><span>  present  SECRETARY  FOR  LANDS.  It  will,</span><span>  in  fact,  be  a  measure  of  which  thc</span><span>  parentage  might  as  consistently  bc</span><span>  claimed  by  Mr.  STEPHENS  or  Mr.</span><span>  RAMSAV,  by  Mr.  GROOM  or  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  WEINHOI.T.</span></p> <p><span>  In  all  directions  ominous  murmurings</span><span>  nie  lo  be  heard,  and  as  time</span><span>  passes  on,  thc  sound  of  them  in-</span><span>  creases  in  volume.  The  most  distinct</span><span>  popular  demand  for  land  reform,  foi</span><span>  example,  has  been  in  connection  with</span><span>  thc  homestead  arcas.  Of  these  thc</span><span>  maximum  fixed  by  the  Act  of  1872  was</span><span>  a  block  of  not  more  than  120  acres</span><span>  agricultural  and  200  acres  pastoral.  Thc</span><span>  general  demand,  however,  was  for  an</span><span>  extension  to  640  acres  agricultural,</span><span>  Instead  of  Mr.  STEPHENS  noting  thc</span><span>  signs  of  the  times  in  (his  respect,  he  has</span><span>  perversely  turned  his  eyes  in  thc  othei</span><span>  direction,  and  proposes  to  restrict  the</span></p> <p><span>  j  homestead  to  160  acres.  And  his  bil</span></p> <p><span>  provided  that  any  further  selection  undei</span><span>  the  conditional  clauses,  must  be  con</span><span>  terminous  ;  but  this  was  too  flagrant  s</span><span>  blunder,  and  a  Ministerial  amendment</span><span>  providing  that  such  selections  must  bi</span><span>  within  three  miles  of  each  other,  wa;</span><span>  printed  before  thc  dale  fixed  for  tilt</span><span>  second  reading.  It  is  perfectly  certain  ilia'</span><span>  if  the  bill  ever  gets  into  committee  stil</span><span>  more  important  amendments  will  bc</span><span>  carried.  An  attempt  will  be  made,  a'</span><span>  any  rate,  to  fix  the  maximum  homeslcac</span><span>  area  at  ¿40  acres,  tm  thc  very  sufficieni</span><span>  grounds  thal  with  our  uncertain  climate</span><span>  our  partial  acquaintance  willi  the  possi</span><span>  bilitics  of  agriculture,  and  our  knowledgt</span><span>  that  under  existing  circumstances  ai</span><span>  least  a  square  mile  of  country  is  ncedec</span><span>  to  support  a  family  in  most  parts  of  th&lt;</span><span>  colony-a  smaller  maximum  will  no</span><span>  suffice  to  plant  a  class  of  prosperou;</span><span>  settlers  upon  thc  soil.  Then  it  will  alsc</span><span>  bc  sought  to  extend  thc  maximum  arc:</span><span>  of  conditional  selections  from  1280  acre:</span><span>  lo  5120  acres,  or  from  two  to  eight  squari</span><span>  miles.  And  lhere  will  bc  a  determiner.</span></p> <p><span>  >  attempt  to  aller  thal  clause  which  ruakci</span></p> <p><span>  residence  compulsory,  on  account  of  the</span><span>  discouragement  it  would  offer  to  our  most</span><span>  useful  classes  of  settlers.  Under  the  new</span><span>  bill,  for  instance,  carriers  would  he  unable</span><span>  to  plant  their  families  on  the  land,  because</span><span>  their  avocation  would  disqualify  them</span><span>  irom  holding  a  selection.  This  is  a</span><span>  fatal  objection  to  the  simple  but</span><span>  stringent  residence  clause,  and  it  is  clear</span><span>  that  if  dummying  can  only  be  prevented</span><span>  by  such  a  restriction,  the  remedy  is</span></p> <p><span>  worse  than  the  disease.  Mr.  STEPHENS'</span><span>  clause  will,  if  passed,  exclude  all  but</span><span>  capitalists  from  forming  grazing  farms,</span><span>  and  lend  to  leave  thc  country  in  the</span><span>  hands  of  thc  great  squatter  and  thc</span><span>  poverty-stricken  small  agricultural  settler.</span><span>  The  consequences  of  such  legislation</span><span>  would  be  disastrous,  unless  as  in</span><span>  cases  of  most  restrictions  of  a  like</span><span>  character,  arrangements  could  be</span><span>  made  to  successfully  evade  them.</span><span>  It  is  simply  childish  to  force</span><span>  thc  cultivation  of  the  soil  by</span><span>  such  expedients  as  these.  At  the</span><span>  present  time  grazing  is  the  mainstay</span><span>  of  thc  settler  in  nearly  all  the  districts  of</span><span>  the  colony,  and  the  introduction  of</span><span>  another  industry-that  of  cultivation</span><span>  must  take  place  by  a  gradual  process.</span><span>  The  homestead  or  conditional  selector</span><span>  had  heller  al  the  outset  devote  his</span><span>  limited  means  to  the  enclosure  of  Iiis</span></p> <p><span>  land  and  to  procuring  the  nucleus  of  a  ¡</span><span>  good  flock  of  sheep  or  herd  of  cattle.  ¡</span><span>  His  holding  tims  slocked,  he  will  be  free</span><span>  lo  turn  In's  attention  lo  the  growth  of</span></p> <p><span>  maize,  hay,  and  other  fodder,  and  thus  .</span><span>  not  only  increase  his  income  by  entering  t</span><span>  a  fresh  market,  but  also  prepare  himself  J</span><span>  to  contend  against  those  frequently  i</span><span>  recurring  dry,  cold  winters  which  ordi-</span><span>  narily  destroy  the  natural  grasses  and</span><span>  cause  great  mortality  amongst  the  set-</span><span>  tler's  live  stock.  Thus,  while  gaining</span><span>  experience  of  the  seasons  and  generally</span><span>  developing  the  resources  of  his  estate,  he</span></p> <p><span>  will  be  treading  the  road  to  affluence,  i</span><span>  and  with  ordinary  prudence  will  surely</span><span>  reach  the  goal.</span></p> <p><span>  Unfortunately,  experience  teaches  that</span><span>  in  alienating  Crown  lands,  a  maximum</span><span>  area  must  bc  fixed,  or,  at  the  low  price</span><span>  at  which  they  are  offered,  all  the  good</span></p> <p><span>  lands  would  be  at  once  secured  by  great  j</span><span>  speculators,  who  would  speedily  grow</span><span>  rich  at  the  expense  of  the  industrial  and</span><span>  thrifty  classes.  But  would  it  not  be</span></p> <p><span>  desirable  in  this  matter  to  resort</span><span>  to  a  sliding  scale,  and  regulate</span><span>  tile  maximum  area  of  selections  by  the</span><span>  time  which  had  expired  before  they  were</span><span>  thought  worth  taking  up  ?  Suppose,  for</span><span>  example,  that  for  the  first  year  after</span><span>  a  district  had  been  proclaimed  open  to</span></p> <p><span>  free  selection  the  maximum  area  was</span><span>  fixed  at  1280  acres  ;  for  thc  second  year</span><span>  at  2560  acres  ;  for  the  third  year  5120</span><span>  acres  ;  and  so  011  until  the  ultimate</span></p> <p><span>  maximum  had  been  readied.  The  con-</span></p> <p><span>  sequence  of  sucli  a  system  would  be  the</span><span>  selection  of  all  the  best  lands  first,  and</span><span>  the  non-alienation  of  inferior  lands  until</span></p> <p><span>  contiguous  settlement  and  the  extended</span><span>  arcas  procurable  had  made  them  wortli</span><span>  taking  up.  The  system  of  classifica-</span><span>  tion  by  Commissioners  has  proved  a</span><span>  failure  ;  but  the  plan  above  suggested</span><span>  would  be  practically  classification  bi/</span><span>  time,  and  would  certainly  not  be  open</span><span>  to  the  imputation  of  partiality.</span></p> <p><span>  The  most  gratifying  feature  of  Mr.</span><span>  STEPHENS'  bill,  and  the  one  on  which</span><span>  there  seems  to  be  no  difference  of</span></p> <p><span>  opinion,  is  thc  fixing  of  one  shilling  per</span><span>  annum  as  the  uniform  rent  per  acre  of</span><span>  all  conditional  selections,  without  regard</span><span>  to  situation  or  quality.</span></p> <p><span>  MAILS  per  lady  Bowen,  for  brisbane  direct,</span><span>  will  close  this  evening-for  registered  letters</span><span>  at  six,  and  for  ordinary  letters  at  eight  o'clock.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  our  notice  yesterday  morning  of  pure-</span><span>  bred  stock  by  tho  Balclutha  it  was  not  stated,</span><span>  owing  to  a  tyyographical  omission,  that  threo</span><span>  of  thc  bulls,  viz.,  Littlejohn,  Barrister,  and</span><span>  Adrian,  were  imported  to  thc  order  of  Messrs.</span><span>  ii.  and  J.

The  cultiva-</span><span>  tion  of  the  soil  is  certainly  exciting  more</span><span>  attraction  here  than  formerly,  and  in  nil</span><span>  probability  this  tendency  will  still</span><span>  further  develop  itself  in  the  future.  It</span><span>  may  possibly  not  be  advisable  to  tread</span><span>  in  the  footsteps  of  tbe  Southern  Colonists</span><span>  by  depending  upon  the  cultivation  of</span><span>  cerials,  but  there  are  specialities  which</span><span>  may  be  grown  lier«  with  profitable</span><span>  tesuHs.  Many  people  are  beginning  to</span><span>  loam  that  the  dry-belt  theory  is  falla-</span></p> <p><span>  cious,  and  common  sense  combined  with  '</span><span>  the  prospect  of  a  good  future  for  the</span><span>  agriculturist  is  urgingHbem  to  secure</span><span>  some  of  tho  fertile  and  well-watered</span><span>  hinds  of  the  colony  with  the  expectation</span><span>  of  good  returns  therefrom,  by  the  growth</span><span>  of  crops  adapted  lo  the  country.</span></p> <p><span>  At  this  particular  juncture,  when</span><span>  ""  rich  fields  and  pastures  new  ""  are</span><span>  being  reclaimed  from  nature  by  BODIO  of</span><span>  our  colonists,  a  few  hints  and  warnings</span><span>  with  reference  to  agriculture  may  not  be</span><span>  ill-timed.  The  cultivation  of  the  soil  in</span><span>  Queensland  has  not  advanced  beyond</span><span>  what  may  be  termed  the  experimental</span><span>  stage.  It  is  known  that  sugar-cane,</span><span>  cotton,  maize,  arrowroot,  and  possibly</span><span>  potatoes  can  be  successfully  grown  here.</span><span>  Aa  for  cereals  generally,  besides  many</span><span>  specialities  which  might  bo  enumerated,</span><span>  they  have  not  as  yet  received  the  trial</span><span>  necessary  either  for  their  condemnation</span><span>  or  approval.  Some  things  that  will</span><span>  luxuriate  here  may  not  pay,  because  the</span><span>  cost  of  labour  runs  too  high  to  leave</span><span>  any  margin  for  profit.  Coffee,  ten,  flore</span><span>  plants,  and  many  of  the  spices  aro  of  this</span><span>  class,  and  until  further  expcriiner>*</span><span>  trials  have  boen  made,  it  would  -</span></p> <p><span>  wise  to  attempt  their  cul»*"",  ""ot  uo</span><span>  tensively.

Untold  wealth  lies  biddon  in  the</span><span>  fertile  soil  of  this  country,  and  the</span><span>  successful  farmer  with  tho  wealthy</span><span>  grazier  will  yet  represent  no  inconsider-</span><span>  able  portion  of  Queensland's  prosperity.</span><span>  Before  this  is  attained,  however,  much</span><span>  of  hard  work,  hard  pay,  and  bardet</span><span>  disappointment  will  bo  experienced  ;  and,</span><span>  indeed,  it  would  be  unreasonable  to  ex-</span><span>  pect  otherwise.</span></p> <p><span>  Success  in  agriculture  depends  Inrgelj</span><span>  upon  taking  advantage  of  tho  propel</span><span>  seasons  for  different  crops.  Even  cereals</span><span>  generally  regarded  as  unprofitable</span><span>  should  prove  remunerative  if  thc  propel</span><span>  season  of  tho  year  be  clioson  for  theil</span><span>  culture:  especially  when  taking  int«</span><span>  account  the  fact  that  such  produci</span><span>  invariably  commands  a  high  price.  Ii</span><span>  an  ordinary  winter  here,  oaten  hay,  oats</span><span>  and  potatoes  would  yield  good  returns</span><span>  provided  the  soil  were  broken  np  to  ¡</span><span>  sufficient  depth.  And  upon  considera</span><span>  tion,  we  find  it  difficult  to  draw  th</span><span>  lino  of  demarcation  at  all  sharnl</span><span>  between  the  profitable  and  tho  unprofil</span><span>  able  in  theso  malters.  Heretofore  it  hs</span><span>  been  fashionable  to  deny  the  possibilit</span><span>  of  successful  farming  in  norther</span><span>  Queensland,  but  this,  together  wit</span><span>  the  dry-belt  theory,  has  well  nig</span><span>  exploded.</span></p> <p><span>  One  thing  must  be  kept  in  view  i</span><span>  dealing  with  thiB  part  of  our  subject</span></p> <p><span>  the  rapid  growth  of  all  kinds  of</span><span>  vogotation  ;  for  thia  will  to  a  very  great</span><span>  extent  compensate  for  the  brief  duration</span><span>  of  tho  wet  and  growing  season.  If,  in</span><span>  view  of  this,  judicious'  selections  were</span><span>  made  of  early  maturing  varieties  of</span><span>  groin,  potatoes,  and  general  farming</span><span>  produce,  there  would  practically  be  no</span><span>  limit  to  the  agricultural  capabilities  of</span><span>  Queensland.</span></p> <p><span>  But  it  is  not  to  cereals  or  tho  spe-</span><span>  cialities  of  temperate  climes  that  Queens-</span><span>  land  farmors  will  have  to  look  for  profit-</span><span>  able  returns.  Sugar  «rill  always  holdjfiret</span><span>  placo,  ns  it  is  well  suited  to  the  colony,</span><span>  and  will  always  cotónjapad  a  ready</span><span>  market.

Two  crops</span><span>  of  Indian  corn  may  be  garnered  in  tho</span><span>  I  yean  if  proper  judgment  be  exercised</span></p> <p><span>  in  Inking  advantage  of  the  season  and</span><span>  selecting  tho  seed.

Not  only  will  there</span><span>  be  a  forge  local  demand  for  maize,  but</span><span>  tho  new  country  opening  up  for  settle-</span><span>  ment,  and  tho  new  gold-fields  to  the</span><span>  north,  will  stand  in  need  of  large</span><span>  quantities  of  this  valuable  grain.</span></p> <p><span>  Arrowroot  ¡B  also«  suitable  and  profit-</span><span>  able  crop  for  the  agriculturist  of</span><span>  Queensland.  It  is  easy  of  cultivation,</span><span>  yields  well,  and  is  in  good  demand  both</span><span>  in  tho  colonies  and  elsewhere.  The</span><span>  arrowroot  already  grown  and  manufac-</span><span>  tured  in  this  colony  compares  favourably</span><span>  with  any  other  country's  production,</span><span>  and  il  leaves  a  fair  margin  of  profit  to</span><span>  tho  grower.</span></p> <p><span>  Coffee  hue  not  come  much  into  notice</span></p> <p><span>  yet.  There  are  difficulties  in  the  way  of</span></p> <p><span>  itB  extensive  cultivation  which  have  not</span><span>  been  surmounted  hitherto,  bat,  as  they</span><span>  cannot  be  regarded  aa  insuperable,  we</span><span>  may  look  forward  at  no  distant  date  to</span><span>  aeo  the  billy  elopes  of  Queensland  pro-</span><span>  duce  tho  coffee  berry  in  abundance  and</span><span>  perfection.  Care,  attention,  and  skill  are</span><span>  necessary  to  raise  the  plant  from  seed</span><span>  nnd  bring  it  on  to  strength  sufficient  for</span><span>  handling  and  putting  out.  This  would</span><span>  properly  fall  into  the  hands  of  the</span><span>  nurseryman,  as  it  would  be  much  better</span><span>  for  thc  codee-planter  to  have  the  young</span><span>  trees  ready  to  his  hand,  than  run  the</span><span>  risks  attendant  upon  their  propagation.</span></p> <p><span>  Tue  cultivation  of  tea  cannot  be</span><span>  expected  to  receive  attention  here  until</span><span>  wages  fall  considerably  below  their</span><span>  present  rate.  At  the  same  time  it  would</span></p> <p><span>  bc  well  fur  persons  engaged  in  agricul-</span><span>  ture  to  make  experiments  witn  this</span><span>  plant,  as  the  heavy  duty  upon  it  should,</span><span>  we  think,  make  its  cultivation  remunera-</span><span>  tive.  If  cheap  labour  could  be  had  for</span><span>  gathering  tho  leaves,  all  the  rest  is  com-</span><span>  paratively  easy.  Coolies  could  easily  be</span><span>  procured,  and  would  probably  serve  the</span><span>  purpoeo  better  than  labour  lit  any  stber  ¡</span><span>  description.  -  1</span></p> <p><span>  Fibre  plants  deserve  attention,  as  they</span><span>  may  be  grown  hore  in  great  variety,  and  I</span><span>  fibres  form  an  article  of  commerce  in</span><span>  request.  The  sida  retina  claims  atten-</span><span>  tion  as  a  good  fibre-producing  plant,</span><span>  indigenous  to  this  country,  and  should</span></p> <p><span>  occupy  a  position  in  Queensland  similar  I</span><span>  to  that  DOW  held  by  the  phormwm  tenaç</span></p> <p><span>  in  New  Zealand.</span></p> <p><span>  Then  there  are  the  many  varieties  of</span><span>  spices  which  would  thrive  well  in  our</span><span>  poor  and  stony  ridges,  where  other  crops</span><span>  would  languish.</span></p> <p><span>  May  we  not  say,  then,  that  the  agri-</span><span>  cultural  prospects  of  this  colony  are</span><span>  promising  ?  There  is  an  abundance  of</span><span>  rich  land  in  the  country  fitted  ad-</span><span>  mirably  for  thc  growth  of  all  we  have</span><span>  mentioned,  and  a  great  variety  besides,</span><span>  and  surely  there  is  scope  enough  in  theBe</span><span>  for  agricultural  enterprise.</span></p> <p><span>  But  agriculture  is  carried  on.  at  a</span><span>  great  disadvautage  unless  >**ock-raising</span><span>  accompanies  it.

The  thing  to</span><span>  be  studied  is,  bow  to  ensure  a</span><span>  crop  in  an  unfavourable  season.</span><span>  Quceuslaud  is  not  at  all  singular  in</span><span>  having  exceptional  seasons  of  drought</span><span>  is  no  reason  why  such  should  be  feared</span><span>  here  any  more  than  in  other  tropical</span><span>  countries.  The  first  and  best  safeguard</span><span>  against  drought  is  deep  tillage,  always</span><span>  supposing  that  it  is  accompanied  with</span><span>  proper  drainage.  The  next  thing  to</span><span>  help  to  conserve  moisture  is  the  frequent</span><span>  stirring  of  the  surface  amongst  growing</span><span>  crops,  as  it  tends  to  check  evaporation</span><span>  aud  promote  absorption.  Much  may  be</span><span>  done,  however,  by  enterprise  and  ek.il!,</span><span>  either  privately  or  by  the  assistance  of</span><span>  tho  Government,  to  aid  this  important</span><span>  interest  by  means  of  efficient  irrigation.</span><span>  Tho  rainy  season  furnishes  a  full  supply</span><span>  for  all  our  needs  in  this  respect,  provided</span><span>  it  could  bo  conserved  by  dams  and  wells,</span><span>  and  such  machiuery  furnished  as  would</span><span>  cheaply  and  effectively  raise  it  to  the</span><span>  required  level.

Last  session  the  attempt  to  pass  a</span><span>  similar  Bill  was  repeated,  but  without  suc-</span><span>  cess,  for  the  measure  was  rejected  in  pass-</span><span>  ing  through  committee  in  the  legislative</span><span>  Assembly.  The  causes  of  rejection  did</span><span>  not  appear  in  the  reported  debates,</span><span>  but  it  is  understood  that  the  certainly  of</span><span>  the  bill  being  thrown  out  by  thc  Upper</span><span>  House,  and  the  then  moribund  con-</span><span>  dition  of  the  Lower,  precluded  all  hope</span><span>  of  its  becoming  law,  and  very  properly,</span><span>  we  think,  the  measure  was  relegated  to</span><span>  the  constituencies  al  the  General</span><span>  Election.  '1'he  fact  that  the  new  Govern-</span><span>  ment  have  promptly  nailed  their  colours</span><span>  to  the  mast  on  this  question,  induces  the</span><span>  belief  that  lite  predominant  feeling  of</span><span>  the  Legislature  and  the  country  is  sup-</span><span>  posed  to  be  in  favour  of  reimbursing</span><span>  hon.  members  in  the  amount  of  their</span><span>  actual  expenses,  at  least,  while  engaged</span><span>  in  legislative  duties.</span></p> <p><span>  Tile  question  is  therefore  now  fairly</span><span>  before  the  colony,  and  demands  from  the</span><span>  thinking  portion  of  the  public  calm  and</span><span>  earnest  consideration.  It  is  perhaps  nol</span><span>  a  subject  of  transcendent  importance,</span><span>  and  therefore  was  not  made  a  test  point</span><span>  at  the  late  election.  Still,  in  all  tlie</span><span>  populous  constituencies  the  public  voice,</span><span>  where  it  was  heard  at  all,  spoke  in  favour</span><span>  of  payment,  and  hence,  we  presume,  the</span><span>  firm  stand  taken  bj'  the  Ministry  on  the</span><span>  subject.  There,  is  however,  an  impor-</span><span>  tant  minority  of  the  better  educated</span><span>  electors  who  view  the  proposed  change</span><span>  with  grave  apprehension,  and  who</span><span>  regard  payment  of  members  as  the  in-</span><span>  evitable  precursor  of  a  deteriorated  Le-</span><span>  gislature.

The  very  fact  that  it  is  pro-</span><span>  posed  to  devote  some  twelve  thousand</span><span>  pounds  a-year  to  such  a  purpose,  should</span><span>  induce  our  legislators  to  exhibit  scrupu-</span><span>  lous  care  and  delicacy  in  recording  their</span><span>  opinions  and  voles  in  reference  to  it.</span></p> <p><span>  .  A  glance  at  the  position  of  the</span><span>  question  elsewhere  may  assist  the  reader</span><span>  in  coming  to  a  satisfactory  conclusion,</span><span>  ll  may  be  hardly  necessary  to  observe</span><span>  that,  down  lo  a  comparatively  recent</span><span>  period,  members  of  the  House  of</span><span>  Commons  were  paid  by  theirconsritueiits,</span><span>  and  that  the  custom  lias  probably  fallen</span><span>  into  desuetude  through  circumstances</span><span>  peculiar  to  the  mother  countiy.  The</span><span>  United  Kingdom  is  fortunate  in  the</span><span>  possession  of  a  numerous  leisure</span><span>  class,  drawn  from  almost  every  grade  of</span><span>  the  community.  The  country  is  small</span><span>  and  compact,  and  the  facilities  for  tra-</span><span>  velling  are  great.  These  circumstances</span><span>  are  a  guarantee  of  real  representation  lo</span><span>  the  remotest  constituency,  and  no  didi</span><span>  cully  is  experienced  in  procuring  the</span><span>  willing  sen-ices  of  local  men  whenever</span><span>  desirable.  lt  therefore  follows  thal</span><span>  while  payment  t»f  members  may  be</span><span>  wholly  unnecessary  in  Kngland,  il  may</span><span>  be  absolute!)'  indispensable  in  coun-</span><span>  tries  less  fortunately  situated.  As  a</span><span>  matter  of  fact,  the  representilives  oflht</span><span>  people  are  paid  in  almost  ever)</span><span>  Kuropean  country.  In  the  Uniut'</span><span>  States  and  in  Canada  a  similar  prac</span><span>  lice  obtains.  And  although  it  maj</span><span>  be.  ;  signed  that  on  the  continent  ó</span><span>  Ktirone*>ep!'ese!tU!tive-  government  ii</span><span>  scarcely  out  of  its  swaddling  clothes,  anc</span><span>  that  in  the  United  Slates  it  is  attendei</span><span>  hy  a  deplorable  amount  of  corruption</span><span>  thc  Canadian  Dominion  may  be  pointée</span><span>  to  tnth  pride  as  among  the  most  ad</span></p> <p><span>  vanced  of  all  countries  in  the  art  of  self'</span><span>  government.  Unless  it  can  be  shown</span><span>  that  payment  ol'  members  impairs  the</span><span>  efficiency  of  European  Governments,  or</span><span>  corrupts  thc  institutions  of  the  United</span><span>  States,  no  fair  argument  unla.voura.blc  to</span><span>  the  practice  can  be  drawn  (rom  their</span><span>  experience,-  for  by  the  same  process  the</span><span>  efficiency  of  government  in  Canada</span><span>  might  bc  credited  to  thc  payment</span><span>  system.  It  is,  however,  reasonable  to</span><span>  presume  that,  had  not  payment  of</span><span>  members  been  found  necessary,  it  would</span><span>  not  have  been  so  generally  adopted,  and</span><span>  thal  the  exceptional  position  taken  by</span><span>  British  legislators  in  this  respect  is  due</span><span>  to  some  .insular  peculiarity  rather  than</span><span>  to  the  superior  excellence,  as  ""a  general</span><span>  rule,  of  honorary  representation.</span></p> <p><span>  Dut  we  have  examples  of  the  working</span><span>  of  paid  representation  in  the  Southern</span><span>  Hemisphere,  which  may  be  esteemed</span><span>  more  valuable  as  precedents  than  any</span><span>  illustrations  taken  from  Kurope  or  Ame-</span><span>  rica.  In  New  Zealand  the  members  of</span></p> <p><span>  both  general  and  provincial  Legislatures</span><span>  have  been  always  (laid  for  their  services,</span><span>  and  despite  the  cumbersomeness  of  the</span><span>  constitution,  we  have  yet  to  leant  that</span><span>  representative  Government  has  been  a</span><span>  failure  in  that  colony.  The  over</span><span>  legislation  by  the  provincial  councils  is  by</span><span>  no  means  due  to  paid  representation,  but</span><span>  !  lo  the  excessive  powers  conferred  upon</span></p> <p><span>  these  ambitious  bodies.  At  any  rate,  thc</span><span>  payment  system  has  been  on  trial  in  New</span><span>  Zealand  for  many  years,  and  among  the</span><span>  catalogue  of  desired  political  reforms</span><span>  honorary  representation  has  never  yet</span><span>  found  a  place,  lu  Victoria  also,  after</span><span>  years  of  debate,  and  the  exposure  of</span><span>  almost  unparalleled  parliamentary  pro-</span><span>  fligacy,  the  system  of  payment  was</span><span>  adopted  for  three  years.  The  experi-</span><span>  ment,  we  are  told,  has  not  been  success-</span><span>  ful,  and,  in  the  face  of  the  forthcoming</span><span>  elections,  the  Government  have  inti-</span><span>  mated  their  intention  not  to  propose  the</span><span>  renewal  of  the  Payment  of  Members</span><span>  Act.  The  leading  journals  of  Victoria</span><span>  disapprove  of  the  practice,  the  Aryn*</span><span>  because  of  its  democratic  tendencies,</span><span>  thc  Age  because  of  its  costliness,  and</span><span>  alleged  non-success  in  improving  the</span><span>  personnel  of  thc  Legislature.  At  first</span><span>  sight  it  may  be  assumed  that  thc  united</span><span>  testimony  of  Conservatives  and  Liberals,</span><span>  of  Freetraders  and  Protectionists,  should</span><span>  be  conclusive.  Hut  not  so.  The  experi-</span><span>  ment  is  only  in  its  third  year,  and  no</span></p> <p><span>  one  seems  to  assert  that  the  character  of</span><span>  the  Legislature  has  deteriorated  under</span><span>  ils  influence.  Only  a  few  days  ago  we</span><span>  read  a  congratulatory  article  in  the</span><span>  Australasian  upon  the  improved  lone  of</span><span>  political  morality  in  Victoria  of</span><span>  late  years.  There  was  a  time,</span><span>  said  our  able  contemporary,  when  twelve</span><span>  or  thirteen  needy  members  of  the  Legis-</span><span>  lative  Assembly  levied  black  mai)  upon</span><span>  the  public  through  the  Lands  Depart-</span></p> <p><span>  ment,  These  adventurers  hired  rooms</span></p> <p><span>  in  Melbourne,  and  professedly  carried</span><span>  on  business  as  ""commission  agents,</span><span>  but,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  formed  a  parlia-</span><span>  mentary  ""ring,""  whose  influence  was</span><span>  powerful  in  the  Assembly  and  omnipo-</span></p> <p><span>  tent  at  the  Land  Office.  In  those  times</span><span>  departmental  justice  could  only  bc  ob-</span><span>  tained  by  subsidising  one  or  more  mem-</span><span>  bers  of  this  gang.  Hut  matters  have</span><span>  changed  now,  and  the  Legislature  of</span><span>  Victoria  has  been  purged  of  its  most</span><span>  discreditable  elements.  We  do  not</span><span>  argue  that  payment  of  members</span><span>  has  done  this,  but  in  the  face  of  the</span><span>  gratifying  change  we  confess  to  some</span><span>  doubt  as  to  the  genuineness  of  the</span><span>  alleged  reaction  in  favour  of  honorary</span><span>  representation.</span></p> <p><span>  But  even  were  paid  representation</span><span>  unnecessary  in  Victoria,  that  fact  would</span><span>  be  no  sufficient  argument  against  il  here.</span><span>  Queensland  is  an  infantile,  sparsely</span><span>  populated  colony,  and  it  has  been  proved</span><span>  by  thirteen  years'  experience  that  proper</span><span>  representation  is  impossible  without  pay-</span><span>  ment.  With  us,  therefore,  payment  is</span><span>  not  a  question  of  mere  expediency,</span><span>  for  our  constitution  is  unworkable</span><span>  without  it.  In  its  absence  we  may</span><span>  have  représentation  in  name,  but  not</span><span>  in  reality.  If  therefore  we  wish  parlia-</span><span>  mentary  government  in  Queensland  to</span><span>  be  conducted  willi  success,  we  must  be</span><span>  prepared  to  pay  the  men  whose  time</span></p> <p><span>  and  talents  are  devoted  to  the  attain-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  of  that  object.  Al  thc  same  time,</span><span>  we  admit  that  faithful  honorary  represen-</span><span>  tation,  if  not  unprocurable,  would  be</span><span>  attended  by  some  advantage  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  public,  lint  this  is  a  case  itt  which  it  ,</span></p> <p><span>  having  been  found  impossible  to  adapl</span></p> <p><span>  circumstances  to  our  mind,  il  becomes  1</span><span>  our  duty  lo  bring  our  mind  to  circwm-  \</span></p> <p><span>  stances.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  conclusion  therefore  is  that  thc</span><span>  Payment  of  Members  Hill  ought  to  pass,</span><span>  and  lo  have  at  least  three  years'trial  in  this</span></p> <p><span>  colony,  '{'he  Legislative  Council  has  ;</span><span>  already  recorded  its  disapprobation  of</span><span>  the  principle,  but  if,  as  we  anticipate,  j</span><span>  the  new  Hill  bc  passed  by  a  large  majority  i</span><span>  in  thc  Assembly,  it  may  be  hoped  that</span><span>  the  Upper  House  will  gracefully  waive</span></p> <p><span>  ils  theoretical  objections,  and  permit  an  i</span><span>  experiment  to  bc  made  which  cannot  do  j</span><span>  serious  harm,  and  may  possibly  be  the</span><span>  means  of  preserving  the  unity  of  Queens-</span></p> <p><span>  land.</span></p> <p><span>  tioi.il  on  FIRE.-Khaftdowu  a  ipiartcr  of  a  j</span><span>  milo  !

The  remaining  ,£120,000</span><span>  was  received  on  account  of  slam])  duty,</span><span>  postage  and  commission,  fees  of  office,</span><span>  pilotage,  light  dues,  civil  service  super-</span><span>  annuation  fund,  electric  telegraphs,  and</span><span>  miscellaneous  ;  the  last  item  amounting</span><span>  to  the  rather  large  sum  of  ,£20,000.</span><span>  The  total  expenditure  under  the  head</span><span>  General  was  £488,000,  exclusive  of</span><span>  interest  on  loans  incurred  for  general</span><span>  purposes,  and  amounting  to  £62,378.</span><span>  It  would  be  interesting  lo  leam  what</span><span>  the  items  of  this  huge  proportion  of  the</span><span>  loan  expenditure  really  are,  for  the</span><span>  probability  is  thal  some  of  them</span><span>  al  least  ought  to  be  debited</span><span>  to  loan  account.  The  single  item  of</span><span>  immigration,  however,  must  amount  to  a</span><span>  considerable  sum,  and  perhaps,  aller  all,</span><span>  the  amount  charged  to  general  revenue</span><span>  is  not  excessive.  The  total  local</span><span>  revenue  is  given  al  .£502,000,  yielded</span><span>  by  fluid,  Land,  Licenses,  kent,  exclu-</span><span>  sive  of  I.md,  and  Railways.

The  Southern  Division</span><span>  yielded  a  lota!  of  ,£334,000,  or  about</span><span>  30  per  cent.,  or  less  dian  one-third  of</span><span>  the  total  revenue  of  the  colony;  while  the</span><span>  expenditure  for  the  same  district  was</span><span>  ,£203,240,  also  about  30  per  cent,  or</span><span>  1  under  one-third  Ihe  lotal  expenditure  of</span></p> <p><span>  liie  colony.  The  Wide  Bay  and  Kurnell</span><span>  Division  contributed  £45,000,  just  4  per</span><span>  cent,  or  one  twenty-fifth  of  the  total</span><span>  revenue.  The  expenditure  for  the  same</span><span>  district  was  ß  18,000,  less  than  2  per</span><span>  «nt  of  the  total  expenditure,  and  less</span><span>  than  one-half  of  its  ow«  revenue.  The</span><span>  Central  District  yielded  £75,000,  just</span><span>  67Í  per  cent,  or  one-fifteenth  part  of  the</span><span>  total  revenue.  The  expenditure  for  the</span><span>  same  district  was  £55,000,  less</span><span>  than  6  per  cent,  or  one  seventeenth  part</span><span>  of  the  total  expenditure.  The  Northern</span><span>  district  contributed  ¿£50,000,  about  4j¿</span><span>  per  cent,  or  a  twenty-second  part  of  the</span><span>  total  revenue.  The  expenditure  for  the</span><span>  same  district  was  ,¡£38,000,  about  4  per</span><span>  cent,  or  one  twenty-fourth  part  of  the</span><span>  total  expenditure.</span></p> <p><span>  These  figures  show  that  the  Southern</span><span>  Division  obtained  far  more  than  its  pro-</span><span>  portionate  share  of  expenditure  last  year,</span><span>  while  the  Wide  Hay  and  Burnett  Divi-</span></p> <p><span>  sion  obtained  far  less.  The  Central</span><span>  Division  received  a  smaller  proportion</span><span>  than  the  .Southern,  and  smaller  even</span><span>  than  tlie  Northern,  although  the  greater</span><span>  proportionate  contribution  to  the  general</span><span>  revenue  by  the  last-named  division,</span><span>  owing  to  the  preponderance  of  adult</span><span>  m  iles,  must  not  be  forgotten.  The  con-</span><span>  sumption  of  dutiable  goods  per  head  of</span><span>  the  population  is  very  much  grenier  in</span><span>  the  north  than  in  the  south  ;  and  as</span><span>  Customs  and  Kxcise  revenue  approaches</span><span>  nearly  to  one-half  the  total,  il  is  clear</span></p> <p><span>  (hat  the  North  must  be  in  fairness  cre-</span></p> <p><span>  dited  with  a  larger  contribution  than  is</span></p> <p><span>  shown  under  the  head  of  local  revenue.</span></p> <p><span>  h  would  be  found  (on  examination)</span><span>  that  the  expenditure  under  the  head  of</span><span>  General  Government  and  Loans  is  al  a</span><span>  much  larger  rate  per  head  in  the  South</span><span>  than  in  the  North,  which  further  throws</span><span>  the  balance  of  expenditure  in  favour  of</span><span>  the  metropolitan  districts.  No  doubt  the</span><span>  excess  arises  chiefly  from  the  payments</span><span>  on  account  of  Southern  Railway  loans</span><span>  which,  will)  the  working  expenses,  swallow</span><span>  up  _>£S.),ooo  annually  in  interest,  over</span><span>  andabove  the  total  receipts.  The  Northern</span><span>  Railway  shows  still  less  favourably,  as</span><span>  absorbing  .£25,000  annually  more  titan</span><span>  the  revenue  it  yields,  it  amounis,  in</span><span>  fact,  to  nearly  one-half  of  the  total</span><span>  expenditure  in  thc  Central  Division  on</span><span>  local  account,  and  yet  the  surplus  balance</span><span>  is  proportionately  larger  in  that  division</span><span>  than  in  any  of  the  others  except  Wide</span><span>  Hay.  So  much  for  the  allegation  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Miyisn.it  rou  WORKS  that  ihe  Central</span></p> <p><span>  districts  have  been  pampered  by  over</span><span>  expenditure.  Omitting  consideration  of</span><span>  railways  and  loans,  (he  Central  Division</span><span>  would  show  a  surplus  of  receipts  amount-</span><span>  ing  lo  over  ,¿30,000,  while  the  surplus</span><span>  from  Wide  Hay  with  a  similar  omission</span><span>  would  be  only  .£29.000.</span></p> <p><span>  In  their  Intimates  the  Government</span><span>  have  treated  the  Central  Division  very</span><span>  scantily  on  the  additional  pretext  that</span><span>  where  a  large  expenditure  is  taking  place</span></p> <p><span>  un  loan  account  there  should  be  a  cur-</span></p> <p><span>  tailment  of  outlay  on  account  of  ordinary</span><span>  revenue.  It  may  be  admitted  that  there</span><span>  is  some  force  in  this  argument  if  applied</span><span>  impartially.

But  people  who  read  the</span><span>  Chronicle  are  so  accustomed  lo  find  in</span><span>  its  most  earnest  deliverances  a  supercili-</span><span>  ous  sneer,  that  they  will  notice  the  re-</span><span>  marks  in  question  without  much  irritation.</span><span>  The  writer  infers  that  the  receipts  from  the</span><span>  Rockhampton  ferries  are  ""about  on  a</span><span>  par""  with  those  received  at  Maryborough,</span><span>  and  that  the  Rockhampton  deputation</span><span>  were  mistaken  in  rating  them  at  .£1500.</span><span>  Now,  the  records  prove  that  the  revenue</span><span>  at  tile  Maryborough  ferries  is  liol  on  a  par</span><span>  willi  thal  received  from  those  nf  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  ;  and  the  deputation  did  not</span><span>  rate  their  receipts  at  ¿£1500.

Such  a  method  of  debating  a</span><span>  question  is  unanswerable.  If  the  facts  are</span><span>  against  ns,  practically  says  tile  Chronicle,</span></p> <p><span>  so  much  the  worse  for  the  facts.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  contemporary  is  positively  amusing</span></p> <p><span>  when  he  teiis  us  thru  the  traffic  from  Rock-</span></p> <p><span>  hampton  ""trends  naturally  south-eastward</span><span>  ""-towards  Gladstone,""  and  that  ""a</span><span>  ""  jv'eat  ninny  years  niusl  elapse  before</span><span>  ""  these  natural  tendencies  undergo  any</span><span>  ""  material  alteration.""  In  matters  of  this</span><span>  kind  experienced  people  have  less  faith</span><span>  than  our  contemporary  in  natural</span><span>  tendencies,  or  we  should  have  seen  the</span><span>  northern  railway  started  from  Gladstone,</span><span>  and  Rockhampton  transplanted  to  the</span><span>  semi-marine  township  of  Herbert-the</span><span>  paper  city  at  Broadmount.  Another</span><span>  edifying  remark  is  that  the  .Mary  bridge</span><span>  would  be  a  ""  link  in  the  high-road</span><span>  between  Mai  /borough  and  the  Capital  ""</span><span>  -in  which  direction  we  suppose  the</span><span>  traffic  from  Maryborough  ""  south-east-</span><span>  ward,  naturally  trends,""  but  lias  been</span><span>  diverted  through  lack  of  a  bridge.  This</span><span>  circumstance,  coupled  with  the  fact  that</span><span>  ""  our  river  could  be  bridged  at  half  the</span><span>  ""  cost  lhat  the  l'ilzroy  could  be,""  make</span><span>  it  ""  at  once  apparent  how  unjust,  nay</span><span>  ""  impertinent,  it  would  be  to  lump</span><span>  ""  the  two  enterprises  together  in  one</span><span>  ""  log-rolling  enterprise.""

But  if  he  means  that  thc</span><span>  two  towns  should  not  cordially  help</span><span>  each  other  to  secure  legitimate  mutual</span><span>  advantages,  thc  doctrine  laid  down  will</span><span>  be  stigmatized  as  petty  and  selfish.</span></p> <p><span>  Of  tile  ""  double-banking  scheme  be-</span><span>  tween  the  Iwo  towns,""  referred  to  by</span><span>  our  contemporary  in  his  closing  para-</span><span>  graph,  we  confess  entire  ignorance.

"<p><span>  ffiin  wnicit  ta  iiïcoRfoUTKD  tur.</span></p> <p><span>  GLADSTONE  OBSJSJtVSR.</span></p> <p><span>  PUBLISHED  DA-ÏLiY.</span><span>  SATURDAY,  FEBRUARY  2S,  1874.</span></p> <p><span>  THF.  new  Government  of  Queensland,</span><span>  true  to  the  traditions  of  its  party,  and</span><span>  pursuant  to  the  desire  of  the  colonists</span><span>  generally,  have  instructed  Mr.  DAINTRIÎI:</span><span>  to  increase  the  stream  of  immigration  to</span><span>  our  shores.  During  the  last  year,  our</span><span>  AKF.NT-GF.NKUM,  succeeded  tn  dispatch-</span><span>  ing  some  seven  thousand  persons,  and</span><span>  these,  instead  of  causing  a  glut  in  the</span><span>  I  labour  market,  appear  lo  have  stimulated</span></p> <p><span>  the  demand  by  opening  new  avenues  for</span><span>  employment.  Mr.  DAIKTKKK  telegraphs</span><span>  that  for  the  next  twelve  months  ito  will</span><span>  be  able  to  dispatch  one  thousand</span><span>  immigrants  per  month.  This  will  be  a</span><span>  numerical  increase  of  about  seventy-five</span><span>  per  cent  upn  last  year's  arrivals,  and  if</span><span>  concurrently  with  increase  in  number</span><span>  there  be  also  a  corresponding  improve-</span><span>  ment  in  quality,  thc  very  best  results  may</span><span>  be  anticipated.  The  greatest  impediment</span><span>  lo  the  progress  of  the  colony  is  want  of</span><span>  population,  and  it  is  therefore  true  policy</span><span>  in  our  Legislature  to  supply  that  want</span><span>  by  liberal  votes  for  immigration  pur-</span><span>  poses.  The  cost  of  the  new  arrivals  last</span><span>  year  was  about  fourteen  pounds  per</span><span>  head,  yet  despite  the  provision  made  for</span><span>  immigration  al  that  rate,  and  the  pay-</span><span>  ment  of  interest  on  ottr  large  public  debt,</span><span>  a  considerable  surplus  of  revenue  still</span><span>  remained.  Another  surplus  ts  expected</span><span>  at  the  close  of  the  current  year,  and</span><span>  the  Government  have  very  properly</span><span>  resolved  lo  appropriate  a  portion  of  it</span><span>  to  increasing  the  volume  of  immigration.</span></p> <p><span>  Taking  a  retrospect  of  our  immigra-</span><span>  tion  arrangements  for  the  year  i  S73,  two</span><span>  striking  features  present  themselves.  In</span><span>  the  first  place,  the  immigrants  have  been</span><span>  belter  distributed  amongst  the  various</span><span>  ports  than  during  any  previous  year-a</span><span>  change  which  has  given  much  satisfac-</span><span>  tion  in  the  north.  In  the  second</span><span>  place,  there  has  been,  both  on  the</span><span>  passage  out  and  after  landing  here,  a</span><span>  serious  development  of  that  fatal  disease</span><span>  known  as  ship  fever.  On  the  whole</span><span>  number  of  the  new  arrivals,  perhaps,  the</span><span>  percentage  of  mortality  from  this  cause</span><span>  lias  been  small,  but  in  certain  vessels  it</span><span>  has  been  undoubted)'  large.  This  under</span><span>  any  circumstances  would  lie  a  matter  for</span><span>  regret,  but  it  becomes  especially  so  in</span><span>  the  knowledge  that  thc  ravages  of  ship</span><span>  fever  may  be  greatly  mitigated-in  fact,</span><span>  may  be  fairly  classed  amongst  prevon</span><span>  tibie  evils.  With  the  exercise  of</span></p> <p><span>  intelligent  precaution,  the  disease  may</span><span>  almost  be  warded  oft  altogether,  and  if</span><span>  our  immigration  authorities  fail  in  this</span><span>  respect,  they  will  incur  a  grave  respon-</span><span>  sibility.  And  not  them  alone.  Thc</span><span>  people  of  llie  whole  colony,  as  the</span><span>  fountain  of  power,  have  an  ultimate</span><span>  liability  which  they  cannot  get  rid  of;</span><span>  and  if  the  Government  fail  to  recognise</span><span>  the  gravity  of  the  evil,  public  opinion</span></p> <p><span>  should  make  itself  heard  in  a  manner</span><span>  which  admits  of  no  misunderstanding.</span><span>  When  from  a  single  shipload  of  people</span><span>  fifteen  or  twenty  persons  in  the  prime</span><span>  of  their  strength  arc  sometimes  cut  off</span><span>  by  fever,  it  is  surely  time  that  energetic</span><span>  steps  were  taken  by  the  authorities  to</span></p> <p><span>  abate  the  virulence  of  the  disorder.</span></p> <p><span>  We  ave  glad  to  see  that  this  matter</span><span>  has  at  length  been  reported  upon  by  Dr.</span><span>  SALMOND,  the  Sub-immigration  Agent</span><span>  and  Health  Officer  at  Rockhampton.</span><span>  That  gentleman  has  officially  recom-</span><span>  mended  that  all  immigrant  vessels  be</span><span>  quarantined  for  a  period  of  seven  days</span><span>  .after  arrival,  thal  the  people  be  landed</span><span>  al  the  quarantine  station,  and  that  Ihc</span></p> <p><span>  lime  be  occupied  in  cleansing  their</span><span>  clothes  and  persons.  Dr.  SAI.MONII</span><span>  believes  that  the  daily  ablutions,  the  use</span><span>  of  fresh  provisions,  and  thc  pureness  of</span><span>  the  atmosphere,  would  have  a  most</span><span>  favourable  effect  upon  the  health  of  the</span><span>  immigrants,  and  nip  the  germs  of  fever</span><span>  which  might  be  dormant  in  thc  constitu-</span><span>  tion.  At  worst,  time  would  be  allowed</span><span>  for  latent  sickness  to  develope  itself,  and</span><span>  we  should  have  less  of  fatal  cases  of  ship</span><span>  fever  among  immigrants  who  had  a  few</span><span>  days  previously  landed  apparently  in</span><span>  perfect  health.  The  suggestion  is  a  good</span><span>  one,  for  it  is  undeniable  that  the  persons</span><span>  and  garments  of  immigrants  are  often  in</span><span>  need  of  a  thorough  cleansing  before</span><span>  coming  ashore.  Everybody  who  has</span><span>  been  brought  into  contact  with  new</span><span>  arrivals  from  Europe,  must  be  aware</span><span>  that  the  ""  ship  smell  ""  often  hangs  about</span><span>  them  for  weeks  after  they  have  landed</span><span>  and  mixed  indiscriminately  with  the</span><span>  colonial  population  ;  and  during  the  last</span></p> <p><span>  six  months  lhere  has  been  undoubted</span><span>  proof  also  that  they  sometimes</span></p> <p><span>  carry  with  them  into  the  far  in-</span><span>  terior  the  latent  germs  of  mortal  sick-</span><span>  ness.  Fatal  cases  are  known  to  have</span><span>  occurred  among  the  Landsborough's</span><span>  immigrants  a  few  months  ago  after  they</span><span>  had  reached  Copperfield,  while  at  the</span><span>  Rockhampton  hospital  there  was  a  large</span><span>  accession  of  patients  from  the  same</span><span>  vessel,  although  on  arrival  she  had  no</span></p> <p><span>  sickness  on  hoard  to  warrant  the  HHAI.TII</span><span>  OrncüR  in  refusing  pratique.  In  con-</span><span>  nection  with  this  matter  one  satisfactory</span><span>  circumstance  may  he  mentioned.  Up</span><span>  to  the  present  lime,  there  is  no  known</span><span>  instance  of  ship  fever  being  communi-</span><span>  cated  by  immigrants  to  the  shore  popula-</span><span>  tion  ;  and  this  notwithstanding  the  fact</span><span>  that  several  cases  are  known  of  persons,</span><span>  who  had  landed  in  apparent  health,</span><span>  succumbing  lo  attacks  of  the  disease  so</span><span>  long  as  two  months  after  their  debarka-</span><span>  tion.  While  therefore,  we  cordially</span></p> <p><span>  endorse  Dr.  SAI.MOND'S  recommenda-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  in  this  matter,  wc  cannot  regard  it</span><span>  quite  as  a  preventive  of  thc  evil  under</span><span>  consideration.  The  cleansing  and</span><span>  purifying  process  is  requisite  on  sanitary</span><span>  grounds,  and  it  may  in  certain  cases  mp</span><span>  the  germs  of  the  disease,  but  alone  it</span><span>  will  not  be  an  effectual  antidote  to  ship</span><span>  fever.  The  mischief  is  usually  done</span><span>  before  the  immigrant  vessels  reach  our</span><span>  harbour,  and  the  causes  are  manifold.</span></p> <p><span>  To  begin  with,-the  wrong  class  of</span><span>  people  arc  often  selected-persons  with</span><span>  debilitated  constitutions  arising  from</span><span>  constitutional  taint,  vicious  indulgences,</span><span>  semi-starvation,  or  unclean  habits.</span><span>  Thrust  into  a  crowded  emigrant  ship,</span><span>  fed  with  provisions  to  which  they  have</span><span>  never  been  accustomed,  deprived  of  all</span><span>  healthy  exercise,  moving  and  sleeping  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  midst  of  foul  air  and  unwholesome</span></p> <p><span>  smells,  neglecting  their  daily  ablutions,</span><span>  and  often  falling  into  a  condition  of</span><span>  morbid  wretchedness,-it  is  no  wonder</span><span>  that  the  immigrant  becomes  thc</span><span>  victim  of  fell  disease.  Thc  preventive</span><span>  measures,  to  be  effectual,  must  therefore</span><span>  be  taken  at  home  and  on  board  ship.</span></p> <p><span>  Tin»  im  mirv  into  nrevious  habits  anil</span></p> <p><span>  character  should  he  more  searching,  the</span><span>  medical  examination  more  thorough,  the</span><span>  ventilation  on  board  ship  more  effective,</span><span>  and  the  discipline  more  strict.  Persona!</span><span>  cleanliness  should  be  rigidly  insisted</span><span>  upon,  and  exemplary  punishment  meted</span><span>  out  for  disobedience  in  this  respect.  An</span><span>  immigrant  should  be  required  to  sur-</span><span>  render  his  liberty  for  the  term  of  the</span><span>  passage,  and  to  live  strictly  according  to</span><span>  the  niles  adopted  for  sanitary  purposes.</span><span>  With  regard  lo  ventilation,  it  is  much  to</span><span>  be  regretted  that  the  'tween  decks  plan</span><span>  of  the  Imperial  Emigration  Com-</span><span>  missioners  is  not  adopted  in  our  vessels.</span><span>  The  opinion  ofexperienccd  medical  men</span><span>  is  that  ""  Allen's  Patent  Uerths,""  are  hot-</span><span>  beds  of  disease.

Our  object</span><span>  in  giving  extended  publicity  to  the  evi-</span><span>  dence  is  not  so  much  because  of  any</span><span>  intrinsic»  importance  wc  attach  to  the</span><span>  case,  as  from  a  desire  to  put  a  check  on</span><span>  exaggerated  reports  as  to  the  nature  oí</span><span>  the  assault  which  caused  proceedings  to</span><span>  be  taken.  It  would  appear  that  the  girl,</span><span>  when  called  upon  for  an  exercise  which</span><span>  had  been  given  her  two  or  three</span><span>  days  previously,  said  she  had  not</span><span>  finished  it,  but  would  try  to  do  so  in  a</span><span>  couple  of  days.  This  answer  did  not</span><span>  satisfy  Mrs.  CONNOLLY,  who,  in  order  to</span><span>  test  thc  girl's  veracity,  sent  for  the  exer-</span></p> <p><span>  cise  book.  The  book  came  in  due,</span><span>  course,  and  nothing  of  the  exercise  was</span><span>  written  in  it.  Mrs.  CONNOLLY  thereupon</span><span>  concluded,  whether  rightly  or  wrongly,</span><span>  that  Miss  PRICE  was  guilty  of  thc  double</span><span>  offence  of  idly  neglecting  her  school</span><span>  duties  and  endeavouring  by  falsehood  to</span><span>  hide  her  faults,  and  gave  her  a  severe</span><span>  beating.  Whether  the  girl  was  really</span></p> <p><span>  so  much  to  blame  as  the  schoolmis-</span><span>  tress  supposed  we  cannot  tell,  for</span><span>  the  evidence  taken  was  all  on  one  side,</span><span>  as  the  defendant  failed  lo  put  in  an</span><span>  appearance.  Without,  however,  im-</span><span>  puting  intentional  misrepresentation  to</span><span>  thc  complainant  and  her  two  school-</span><span>  mates,  who  gave  evidence  in  the  witness</span><span>  box,  wc  may  fairly  assume  that  another</span><span>  side  could  have  been  presented,  and  that</span><span>  the  defendant  might  have  adduced  such</span><span>  evidence  as  would  have  explained  away</span><span>  or  greatly  modified  the  testimony</span><span>  niven  in  the  Court  yesterday.  The</span><span>  beating,  judging  from  Dr.  ROBERTSON'S</span><span>  evidence,  must  have  been  unduly  severe,</span><span>  and  with  the  facts  before  them  the  Bench</span><span>  could  not  do  other  than  order  a  verdict</span><span>  to  be  recorded  against  the  defendant</span><span>  Hut  there  is  undoubtedly  much  to  be</span><span>  said  in  defence  of  Mrs.  CONNOLLY.  It</span><span>  is  not  by  any  means  an  easy  task  to</span><span>  maintain  proper  discipline  in  a  large</span><span>  school,  even  of  girls.  Colonial  children</span><span>  are  precocious  and  impatient  of  restraint,</span></p> <p><span>  and  in  too  many  instances  their  .</span><span>  parents  fail  to  a  lamentable  degree  ¡</span><span>  to  keep  them  in  proper  subjection</span></p> <p><span>  at  home.  We  are  perfectly  certain  that  !</span><span>  Rockhampton  is  no  favourable  exception  j</span><span>  in  this  respect,  and  that  a  public  school  !</span><span>  made  up  of  200  or  300  girls  from  all</span><span>  classes  of  the  community  must  contain</span></p> <p><span>  not  a  few  troublesome  scholars.  With</span></p> <p><span>  regard  to  thc  case  of  ADA  PRICE,  it  is  far</span><span>  fFom  our  intention  to  make  her  conduct</span><span>  appear  worse  than  it  really  was  in  order  to</span></p> <p><span>  find  an  excuse  for  MRS.  CONNOLLY.  The</span></p> <p><span>  girl  possibly  did  not  on  that  particular</span><span>  occasion  deserve  a  beating  at  al!.  But</span><span>  Mrs.  CONNOLLY  was  evidently  of  a  con-</span><span>  trary  opinion,  and  believed  that  the</span><span>  vigorous  use  of  the  cane  was  necessary</span><span>  in  order  to  maintain  proper  discipline  in</span><span>  the  school.  Unfortunately  she  went  too</span><span>  far,  and  thc  danger  now  is  that,  through</span><span>  excess  of  punishment,  the  offender  will</span><span>  be  commonly  regarded  as  a  martyr.</span><span>  Parents  are  apt  unwittingly  to  encourage</span><span>  this  feeling,  and  thereby  to  weaken  in</span><span>  the  minds  of  the  children  that  feeling  of</span><span>  respect  for  their  teachers  which  is  abso-</span><span>  lutely  essential  to  enable  the  latter  to</span><span>  perform  their  duties  with  efficiency  and</span></p> <p><span>  success.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  little  sympathy  with  the</span><span>  popular  aversion  to  corporeal  punish-</span><span>  ments  in  schools,  believing  that  they  are</span><span>  frequently  far  more  salutary  than  other</span><span>  favourite  modes  of  punishment.  And  even</span><span>  with  girls,  in  a  public  school,  we  are  dis-</span><span>  posed  to  think  that  the  cane  may  be  used</span><span>  with  great  efficacy.  But.  moderation</span><span>  is  a  virtue,  and  school  chastisements</span><span>  should  not  be  inflicted  in  a  brutal  or</span><span>  savage  manner.  It  would  be  better  in</span><span>  extreme  cases,  after  having  called  in</span><span>  parental  aid  without  effect,  to  resort  to</span><span>  expulsion.  Incorrigibles  should  not,</span><span>  under  any  circumstances,  be  permitted</span><span>  to  remain  in  a  school.  If,  however,  the</span><span>  rod  will  save  children  from  reaching  that</span><span>  unenviable  degree  of  degradation,  let  it</span><span>  be  used  by  all  means,  and  used  without</span><span>  restraint  from  any  maudlin  feeling  of</span><span>  delicacy.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  annual  mooting  af  the  members  of  thc</span><span>  School  of  Arts  is  to  take  place  this  evening,  in</span><span>  the  hall  of  thc  same,  at  eight  o'clock.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  meeting  of  tho  Rockhampton  Phil-</span><span>  harmonic  Society,  convened  to  take  place  in</span><span>  tho  School  of  Arts  last  evening,  was  postponed</span><span>  until  next  Wednesday  at  thc  same  time  and</span><span>  place,  thc  Committee  having  met  iii  thc  after-</span><span>  noon,  and  so  arranged,  as  many  of  tho  mem-</span><span>  bers  were  desirous  of  attending  Miss  Joey</span><span>  Gougenhcim's  benefit  at  tho  Theatre  Royal</span></p> <p><span>  A  CASE  oamo  beforo  tho  Police  Court  yester-</span><span>  day,  in  which  a  man,  named  Thomas  Halan,</span><span>  was  charged  with  being  drunk  at  tho  railway-</span><span>  station,  and  destroying  property  belonging  to</span><span>  thc  railway  guard.  Tho  bye-laws  under  tho</span><span>  Railway  Act  próvido  that  in  audi  a</span><span>  case,  tho  guard  may  take  tho  offender  in</span><span>  charge  and  bring  him  before  a  Bench</span><span>  of  Magistrates.  They  also  authorise  thc</span><span>  infliction  of  a  fine  for  such  offence  not</span><span>  exceeding  £5.  The  railway  guard  in  this</span><span>  particular  instance  took  tho  man  in  charge,</span><span>  and  afterwards  handed  him  over,  while  within</span><span>  thc  railway  enclosure,  to  a  constable,  who</span><span>  convoyed  him  to  tho  lock-up.  A  technical</span><span>  objection  upset  tho  case,  and  caused  thc  pri-</span><span>  soner  to  bo  discharged,  although  he  admitted</span><span>  tho  drunkenness.  It  seems  that  the  bye</span><span>  laws  posted  up  at  the  Railway-station</span><span>  are  not  thc  most  recent,  and  although</span><span>  in  thc  particular  matter  of  dealing  with</span><span>  drunkenness  and  disorderly  conduct  thoy  arc</span><span>  word  for  word  the  same  as  those  last  promul-</span><span>  gated,  and  are  goneroUyto  the  same  effect,</span><span>  but  they  boar  a  different  date.  The  bye-laws</span><span>  at  prenont  in  uso  by  tho  railway  officials  are</span><span>  contained  in  a  small  book  ;  and  there  was  no</span><span>  evidence  before  the  Court  that  they  had  ever</span><span>  been  legally  brought  into  operation.  Tho</span><span>  objection  was  deemed  fatal,  and  thc  Bench</span><span>  had  no  alternative  but  to  discharge  the</span><span>  prisoner.  But  had  this  point  not'  boen</span><span>  raisod,  it  is  possible  that  objection  would</span><span>  have  been  -successfully  taken  to  thc</span><span>  manner  in  which  the  defendant  was</span><span>  handed  over  to  tho  police.  If  we  under-</span><span>  stand  the  law  rightly,  the  guard  should  him-</span><span>  self  have  taken  tho  man  to  thc  lock-up.  Or</span><span>  another  course  was  open.  The  guard  might</span><span>  have  removed  the  inobriatc  outside  the  railway</span><span>  enclosure,  and  then  have  allowed  a  constable  to</span><span>  take  him  to  tho  lock-up  for  the  ordinary</span><span>  offence  of  drunkenness  ina  public  place.  How-</span><span>  ever,  the  failure  of  this  case  should  cause  such</span><span>  steps  to  bo  taken  os  to  prevent  thc  ends  of</span><span>  justice  being  again  defeated  in  a  similar</span></p> <p><span>  manner.</span></p> <p><span>  MACKAV  Correa  MIKES.  -  Tho  accounts</span></p> <p><span>  from  thc  copper  mines  arc,  we  [il.

In  the  Kennedy  electorate</span><span>  one  camp  of  twenty-five  miners  is  said  to</span><span>  have  been  altogether  passed  by,  and</span><span>  there  is  no  doubt  that  similar  omissions</span><span>  have  been  made  in  some  of  the</span><span>  electorates  of  the  central  districts.

The  Municipal  Council</span><span>  has  not  only  beon  a  credit  tb  tho  town,</span><span>  but  also  to  tho  colony  at  large.  When</span><span>  Mr.  PALM  icu  spoke  of  the  Municipal</span><span>  Council  of  Rockhampton  as  tho  best  iu</span><span>  the  colonies,  his  eulogy  was  deemed</span><span>  somewhat  extravagant.  Butin  point  of</span><span>  fact  we  do  thiuk  our  Council  may  chal-</span><span>  lenge  comparison  with  any  otlier</span><span>  municipal  body  in  the  colonies.</span><span>  Whether  we  regard  tho  character  and</span><span>  abilities  of  the  aldermen,  the  mode  in</span><span>  which  business  is  conducted,  or  the</span><span>  results  as  shown  in  the  respect-</span><span>  able  appearance  of  our  main  streets,</span><span>  we  cannot  claim  for  our  Corporation</span><span>  anything  less  tban  the  front  rank  among</span><span>  civic  institutions.  And  when  we  write</span><span>  thus,  tho  reader  must  not  suspect  us  of</span><span>  flattery.  We  give  praise  to  whom  praire</span><span>  is  duo,  in  the  belief  that  by  so  doing  we</span><span>  contribute  to  perpetuating  the  good</span><span>  character  of  our  Council.  It  is  very</span><span>  unfortunate  when  tho  action  of  cor-</span></p> <p><span>  porate  bodies  brings  them  under  the</span></p> <p><span>  deserved  censure  of  the  Press.  The  evil</span></p> <p><span>  does  not  cease  with  the  annoyance  caused</span><span>  to  individuals.  When  sensitive  men</span><span>  perceive  that  acceptance  of  civic  respon-</span><span>  sibilities  places  them  in  imminent  danger</span><span>  of  adverse  criticism,  thoy  naturally  prefer</span><span>  the  walks  ofprivate  life,  and  leave  to  less</span><span>  scrupulous  and  less  intelligent  men  the</span><span>  obligations  and  dubious  honours  of</span><span>  public  life.  Give  a  dog  a  bad  name,</span><span>  and  you  may  as  well  hang  him,  is  a  trite</span><span>  saying  which  applies  equally  to  Cor-</span><span>  porations,  and  thereforowhen  a  Municipal</span><span>  Council  falls  into  public  disrepute,  it</span><span>  might  as  well  at  once  be  abolished.  No</span><span>  good  men  will  be  indnced  to  accept  a</span><span>  seat  in  it,  and  under  such  circumstances</span><span>  local  government  can  only  descend  from</span><span>  bad  to  worse,  until  it  becomes  a  curse</span><span>  rather  than  a  blessing  to  the  commu-</span><span>  nity.</span></p> <p><span>  We  therofore  ofter  our  congratulations</span><span>  on  tho  high  character  of  our  corporation</span><span>  with  hearty  pleasure,  and  only  hope</span><span>  that  the  result  of  tn.day's  election  will</span><span>  bo  to  perpetuate  tho  good  namo  and</span><span>  fumo  which  our  Council  at  present</span><span>  enjoys.

This,  in  a  colony  whore  local</span><span>  institutions  arc  so  generally  ill-managed,</span><span>  is  indeed  high  praise,  and  gives  to  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  a  position  of  which  ber  citizens</span><span>  may  well  be  proud.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  an  unequivocal  honour  to  any</span><span>  citizen  to  win  a  seat  at  our  Council</span><span>  Board,  and  hence  when  vacancies  occur</span><span>  eligible  candidates  are  always  forthcom-</span><span>  ing.

"<p><span>  The  Rockhampton  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  with  which  is  incorporated  with</span></p> <p><span>  Gladstone  Observer.</span></p> <p><span>  PUBLISHED  DAILY</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  MARCH  7,  1874.</span></p> <p><span>  The  safety  of  the  good  ship  Southern</span><span>  Belle  is  more  due  to  good  luck  than</span><span>  good  management.  After  the  storm  in</span></p> <p><span>  which  the  vessel  was  dismasted  she  was</span></p> <p><span>  ""in  dangers  oft,""  and  her  escape  during</span><span>  the  gusty  weather  that  has  lately  pre-</span><span>  vailed  upon  our  coast  is  a  subject  for</span><span>  special  congratulation.  Landsmen  must</span><span>  speak  with  diffidence  on  nautical  sub-</span><span>  jects,  and  be  always  ready  to  accept  cor-</span><span>  rection,  but  in  cases  where  valuable</span><span>  human  life  is  jeopardised,  they  are</span><span>  entitled  to  ask  for  information  when  due</span><span>  care  appears  not  to  have  been  exercised</span></p> <p><span>  or  mistakes  avoided.  It  does  seem  to</span></p> <p><span>  have  been  an  error  of  judgment,  for</span><span>  example,  when  the  CAPTAIN  of  the</span><span>  Southern  Belle  -  fearing  in  her  crippled</span><span>  state  to  attempt  Capricorn  Channel,</span><span>  resolved  to  brave  the  dangers  farther</span><span>  north,  and  ultimately  to  cast  anchor  in</span><span>  an  exposed  place  within  three  miles  of  a</span><span>  lee  shore.  But  this  apparent  error  is</span><span>  possibly  capable  of  explanation,  and  as</span><span>  no  casualty  has  resulted,  the  Marine</span><span>  Board  of  Queensland  will  most  likely</span><span>  pass  it  by  unnoticed.  Recollecting  the</span><span>  treatment  meted  out  to  Captains  Sea-</span><span>  ward  and  Mowatt,  however,  we  can</span></p> <p><span>  only  conclude  that  Captain  CARPENTER</span><span>  will  be  particularly  fortunate  if  he  escapes</span></p> <p><span>  the  official  censure  of  our  great  nautical</span><span>  authorities.</span></p> <p><span>  But  it  is  to  the  arrangements  of  these</span><span>  very  authorities  that  we  now  purpose</span><span>  to  direct  attention.  The  news  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  arrival  of  the  Southern  Belle  off</span><span>  the  coast,  and  of  her  casting  anchor  on</span><span>  Sunday  in  an  exposed  place  off  Water-</span><span>  park  Creek,  was  promptly  reported  by</span><span>  special  messenger  from  Mr.  ROBERT</span></p> <p><span>  ROSS  to  the  SUB-COLLECTOR  OF</span></p> <p><span>  CUSTOMS  at  Rockhampton.  The  news</span></p> <p><span>  reached  town  on  Sunday  afternoon,</span><span>  about  half-an-hour  after  the  Mary,  the</span><span>  only  steamer  that  day  in  port,  had  started</span></p> <p><span>  for  Gladstone  with  the  English  Mail.</span><span>  Mr.  KILNER  at  once  reported  the</span><span>  intelligence  to  Harbour-master  RUNDLE,</span></p> <p><span>  who  lives  some  two  miles  out  of  town.</span><span>  Captain  RUNDLE  concluded  that</span><span>  nothing  could  be  done  that  afternoon,</span><span>  and  seems  not  to  have  thought  it  worth</span><span>  while  to  come  into  town  until  the  follow-</span><span>  ing  day,  when  he  reported  the  matter  to</span><span>  Captain  HEATH,  at  Brisbane,  and  calmly</span></p> <p><span>  awaited  instructions.  In  the  meantime</span><span>  the  SUB-COLLECTOR  and  the  HEALTH</span></p> <p><span>  OFFICER,  impressed  with  the  necessity</span></p> <p><span>  of  doing  something,  determined  to</span><span>  dispatch  the  ketch  Violet  to  the  relief  of</span><span>  the  ship,  and  arranged  with  her  owner</span><span>  to  call  for  them  off  Mr.  Ross'  house,  at</span><span>  Bald  Hills,  on  the  following  evening,</span><span>  and  take  them  to  the  dismasted  vessel.</span><span>  Pursuant  to  this  arrangement,  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  KILNER  and  Dr.  SALMOND  started  over-</span></p> <p><span>  land  for  the  coast  next  day.  On  Mon-</span><span>  day  Mr.  Ross  reached  town  with</span><span>  additional  particulars,  which  excited  free</span><span>  comments  upon  the  inaction  of</span><span>  the  HARBOUR-MASTER'S  department.</span></p> <p><span>  Representations  were  then  made  to</span><span>  Captain  RUNDLE,  in  consequence  of</span><span>  which  he  telegraphed  on  his  own</span></p> <p><span>  responsibility  to  Pilot  HAINES,  at  Glad</span><span>  stone,  instructing  him  to  proceed  with</span><span>  the  Mary  at  once  to  the  ship,  and  if</span><span>  unable  to  tow  her  into  port,  to  return  to</span><span>  Keppel  Bay  by  Wednesday,  in</span></p> <p><span>  time  to  meet  the  Queensland</span><span>  steamer,  whose  mails  and  passengers</span><span>  were  to  be  then  transhipped  to  allow  of</span><span>  her  proceeding  at  once  to  the  vessel.  It</span></p> <p><span>  is  understood  that  Pilot  HAINES  also</span><span>  received  instructions  of  similar  purport</span><span>  from  Brisbane.  At  any  rate,  he  left</span></p> <p><span>  Gladstone  for  the  coast  on  the  same</span></p> <p><span>  evening,  and  at  an  early  hour  next  day</span><span>  was  seen  by  Mr.  KILVER  cruising  off</span><span>  Mr.  Ross'  house,  and  inside  the  Keppel</span><span>  Islands.  The  dismasted  ship  and  the</span><span>  steamer  were  both  at  the  time  visible  to</span><span>  Mr.  KILNER  with  the  naked  eye,  although</span><span>  probably  neither  vessel  could  distinguish</span></p> <p><span>  the  other  from  the  deck  level.  About</span><span>  nine  o'clock,  to  Mr.  KILNER'S  astonish-</span><span>  ment,  the  Mary  turned  southward,  and</span><span>  apparently  steamed  for  Keppel  Bay.</span><span>  But  it  has  since  transpired  that  she  cast</span><span>  anchor  inside  South  Keppel  Island,  and</span></p> <p><span>  remained  there  for  the  day,  spending</span><span>  part  of  the  time  in  getting  fuel  from  the</span></p> <p><span>  shore.  Here  she  met  with  the  'Violet'</span></p> <p><span>  and  here  Pilot  HAINES  first  learnt  the</span></p> <p><span>  actual  position  of  the  vessel.  If  ever</span><span>  there  was  an  illustration  of  ""How</span></p> <p><span>  not  to  do  it,""  this  is  one.  Mr.  Ross'</span><span>  first  letter  to  the  Sub-Collector  speci-</span><span>  fically  described  where  the  ship  lay,</span><span>  -  ""twelve  miles  north-east  of  the  house.""</span><span>  Everyone  in  Rockhampton  and  Brisbane</span><span>  knew,  and  the  officials  of  the  harbours</span><span>  and  rivers  department  must  also  have</span><span>  been  well  aware  of  the  exact  position</span><span>  of  the  vessel.  And  yet  the  Mary</span><span>  was  sent  on  a  wild  goose  chase  after  the</span><span>  dismasted  ship!  Whoever  is  responsible</span><span>  for  this  mistake  should  certainly  pay  the</span></p> <p><span>  penalty.  It  is  no  excuse  to  urge  that  no</span><span>  harm  accrued.  It  is  sufficient  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  public  to  know  that  a  large</span><span>  vessel,  with  five  hundred  souls  on  board,</span><span>  was  kept  twenty-fours  hours  in  peril</span><span>  through  an  official  blunder.  If  no  lives</span><span>  were  lost,  five  hundred  persons  were</span><span>  needlessly  allowed  to  remain  in  painful</span><span>  anxiety  ;  for  we  learn  that  on  the  appear-</span><span>  ance  of  the  steamer  five  guns  were  fired</span><span>  by  the  ship,  and  that  on  the  'Mary'</span><span>  coming  alongside.  Many  of  the  pas-</span><span>  sengers  yelled  with  delight,  while</span><span>  others  wept,  laughed,  and  embraced</span><span>  each  other.  So  that,  if  the  delay  was</span><span>  not  destructive  to  life  or  property,  the</span><span>  mental  agony  it  caused  must  count  for</span><span>  something,  at  any  rate.

This  is  perhaps  the  most</span><span>  difficult  and  important  of  the  measures</span><span>  before  Parliament,'  and  consequently  the</span><span>  bulk  of  honorable  members  were  con-</span></p> <p><span>  spicuous  by  their  absence  during  the</span><span>  second  reading.  There  is  some  fun  in</span><span>  badgering  a  public  officer  by  threatening</span><span>  lo  cul  ¿50  off  his  salary,  but  little</span></p> <p><span>  amusement  can  bc  extracted  from  an</span></p> <p><span>  attempt  to  reform  laws  which  are  a  dis-</span><span>  grace  to  our  Statute  Book.  Amongst</span><span>  these  must  be  classed  the  Insolvency</span><span>  Act  of  1864,  which,  while  giving  a</span><span>  dishonest  person  every  opportunity</span><span>  to  cheat  his  creditors,  affords  but</span><span>  slight  protection  to  the  honest  man</span><span>  who,  through  accident  or  indiscretion,</span><span>  is  plunged  into  financial  difficulty.  The</span><span>  evils  of  thc  system  are  numerous,  bul</span><span>  one  may  be  referred  to  by  way  of  illus-</span><span>  tration.  An  insolvent  is  required  to</span><span>  give  up  to  the  Official  Assignee  every</span><span>  shilling  he  has  in  the  world,  and  to  make</span><span>  oath  that  he  has  done  so.  Vet,  if</span><span>  residing  in  a  remote  part  of  the  colony,</span><span>  he  is  required  to  make  two  or  three</span><span>  expeditions  to  Brisbane,  or  bc  dragged</span><span>  there  in  charge  of  a  policeman  and</span><span>  spend  tile  interim  between  each  meeting</span><span>  in  gaol.  Such  an  alternative  is  simply  a</span><span>  disgrace  to  our  civilisation,  and  the</span><span>  country  is  entitled  to  expect  from  its</span><span>  representatives  an  immediate  measure  of</span><span>  amelioration.  But  this  is  only  one  evil</span><span>  out  of  dozens  almost  equally  patent,  and</span><span>  which  need  not  here  be  referred  to.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  GRIFFITH'S  b'll  contains  consider-</span></p> <p><span>  ably  over  two  hundred  clauses,  some  of</span><span>  them  such  as  few  laymen  can  compre-</span><span>  hend.  Hut  as  a  whole  the  measure  is  a</span></p> <p><span>  really  excellent  one,  and  it  has  been  pre-</span><span>  pared  with  great  skill  and  care.  Mainly</span><span>  it  is  based  upon  thc  new  insolvency  law</span><span>  of  England,  but  Mr.  GRIFFITH  has  not</span><span>  scrupled  (to  use  his  own  expression)  to</span><span>  avail  himself  of  useful  clauses  from  the</span><span>  Scotch,  Irish,  and  Victorian  Acts.  The</span><span>  last-named  statute  is  an  adaptation  from</span><span>  thc  English  Act,  and  contains  some</span><span>  improvements  upon  it  ;  while  Mr.</span><span>  GRIFFITH'S  bill  takes  note  of  all  the</span><span>  mosi  recent  English  decisions  in</span><span>  insolvency,  and  remedies  all  the</span><span>  defects  which  the  courts  have  discovered</span><span>  in  the  practical  application  of  the</span><span>  new  Act.  Taken  as  a  whole,  the</span><span>  system  to  be  inaugurated  by  (lie  new</span><span>  measure  will  be  a  great  stride  (in  advance</span><span>  of  tile  existing  law  :-""  The  main  prin</span><span>  ""  ciple  in  the  Hill  is  that  when  a  man</span><span>  ""  is  unable  to  pay,  his  property  shall  be</span><span>  ""  given  up  to  his  creditors  to  be  divided</span><span>  ""  amongst  them,  on  the  ground  that  they</span><span>  ""  being  the  persons  most  interested,</span><span>  ""  should  be  entrusted  with  thc  manage</span><span>  ""  ment  of  the  realisation  and  dis</span><span>  ""  tribnlioti  of  thc  properly.""  This  prin-</span><span>  ciple  is  now  recognised  by  all  the  most</span><span>  recent  legislation  in  British  communities,</span><span>  and  there  can  be  no  question  but  that  it</span></p> <p><span>  is  a  sound  one.</span></p> <p><span>  We  are  unable  lo-day  to  give  even  an</span><span>  abstract  of  the  leading  principles  of  the</span><span>  new  measure,  but  are  glad  lo  leam  thal</span><span>  its  passage  through  Parliament  is  almost</span><span>  certain.

Moreover,  Mr.  GRIFFITH</span><span>  is  well  backed  up  by  the  members  for</span></p> <p><span>  Brisbane  and  the  other  mercantile  con-</span><span>  stituencies,  while  the  majority  of  country</span><span>  members  are  content  lo  lei  the  bill  go</span><span>  I  with  the  most  cursory  examination.</span></p> <p><span>  I  Really,  after  all,  there  is  little  beneficial</span></p> <p><span>  .alteration  to  bi  suggested  in  the  details</span><span>  of  the  bill  ;  and,  therefore,  the  less</span><span>  honorable  members  meddle  with  it  the</span><span>  belter.  It  does  not  pretend  to  be</span><span>  original,  but  a  compilation  of  the  labours</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  most  acute  intellects  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  age.  The  only  fe.tr  is  that  in  some  cases</span><span>  the  peculiar  circumstances  of  the  colony</span><span>  will  be  forgotten  in  transferring  the</span><span>  clauses  bodily  from  the  Jinglish  Act  ;</span><span>  but  we  understand  that  a  pretty  sharp</span><span>  look-out  is  being  kept  in  this  particular.</span><span>  Tile  tardiness  and  difficulty  of  communi-</span><span>  cation  would  interfere  with  thc  operation</span><span>  of  many  of  the  most  useful  sections  ;  but</span><span>  this  obstacle  is  met  by  the  provision  that</span><span>  legal  documents  in  insolvency  may  be</span><span>  transmitted  by  telegraph.

Since  the  utilisation  of  unmar-</span><span>  ketable  Hocks  and  herds  was  found  prac-</span><span>  ticable  by  means  of  boiling-down  estab-</span><span>  lishments,  nothing  has  so  much  contri-</span><span>  buted  to  increase  the  stability  of  grazing</span><span>  pursuits  as  the  commercial  success  of</span><span>  the  meal-tinning  process.  From  the</span><span>  manufacturers'  point  of  view  the  enter-</span><span>  prise  has  perhaps  on  the  whole  barely</span><span>  proved  remunerative,  especially  hy  com-</span><span>  parison  with  thc  results  of  boiling  down.</span><span>  The  product  of  the  tallow  pots  found</span><span>  an  already  established  market.  There</span><span>  was  no  difficulty  about  the  process,  the</span><span>  percentage  of  loss  on  shipments  was</span><span>  trilling,  and  with  the  use  of  ordinarily</span><span>  good  judgment  there  was  but  a  slight</span><span>  element  of  speculation  in  the  conversion</span><span>  of  flocks  and  herds  into  cash.  Vet  even</span><span>  boiling  down  was  spasmodically  carried</span><span>  on,  and  being  a  merely  temporary  expe-</span><span>  dient  for  controlling  the  fluctuations  in</span><span>  the  stock  market,  was  attended  by  a</span><span>  great  amount  of  waste.  The  fal,  hide,</span><span>  and  horns  were  turned  to  account  ;  the</span><span>  flesh  of  the  animal  was  lost.  The  &lt;mes</span><span>  tion  of  questions  therefore  became,</span><span>  How  to  utilise  the  whole  carcase,  and</span><span>  secure  to  the  glazier  the  full  value  of  his</span><span>  product  ?</span></p> <p><span>  For  many  years  the  problem  remained</span><span>  insoluble.  Experiment  after  experiment</span><span>  ended  in  failure.  Hut  the  object  was</span><span>  kept  steadily  in  view,  and  at  length  the</span><span>  tinning  process  presented  a  glimmering</span><span>  of  success.  The  difficulties,  however,</span><span>  were  still  serious.  The  preserved  meat</span><span>  was  unpalatable,  thc  percentage  of  bad</span><span>  tins  more  than  absorbed  the  profit  of  the</span><span>  manufacture,  and  thc  supply  had  to</span><span>  create  the  demand.  At  length,  after</span><span>  long-continued  experiments  and  enor-</span><span>  mous  losses,  a  fair  margin  of  profit  gra-</span><span>  dually  became  discernible.  The  influ-</span><span>  ence  of  the  discovery  was  at  once  felt,</span><span>  and,  strange  to  say,  the  meat-preserv-</span><span>  ing  industry  most  rapidly  developed</span><span>  where  the  most  vigorous  demand  for</span><span>  home  consumption  existed.  The  butcher</span><span>  and  thc  meal-preserver  competed  side  by</span><span>  side  for  the  fattest  beeves  and  thc  heavi-</span><span>  est  wethers.  Naturally  prices  advanced</span><span>  as  the  demand  increased.  In  (lie  mean-</span><span>  while  the  new  industry  steadily  pro-</span><span>  gressed,  and  the  quality  of  the  manufac-</span><span>  ture  advanced  ste])  by  step.  Improve-</span><span>  ment  was  stimulated  by  constant  com-</span><span>  plaints  of  over-cooking  from  the  Euro-</span><span>  pean  consumer.  The  meat,  though  origi</span><span>  nally  good,  was  done  to  rags,  and  no  one</span><span>  who  could  get  fresh-killed  joints  would</span></p> <p><span>  eat  the  Australian  manufacture.  The</span><span>  problem  was  the  most  difficult  yet  en-</span><span>  countered,  bul  ultimately  il  too  was</span><span>  solved.  Preserved  meals  rose  in  public</span><span>  estimation,  and  slightly  also  in  price.</span><span>  Hut  the  price  of  fat  stock  rose  still  fitster,</span><span>  the  limit  of  profitable  manufacture  was</span><span>  passed,  the  meat-preserving  companied</span><span>  had  to  confess  to  a  loss,  and  suspension</span><span>  became  the  order  of  the  day.  Not,</span><span>  however,  until  thc  reserves  of  fal  stock</span><span>  had  sensibly  diminished,  or  until  indis</span><span>  pulable  evidence  was  forthcoming  thal</span><span>  the  demand  had  been  out-running  thc</span><span>  supply.

Il  is  but  fair  to  slate</span><span>  thal  in  the  former  case  thc  net  price  ii</span><span>  named,  while  in  the  latter  the  i/rosi</span><span>  amount  paid  by  thc  meat-preserver  i.'</span><span>  «luotcd.  However,  these  facts  indicate</span><span>  nôt  that  Melbourne  is  become  a  cheapei</span><span>  market  than  Rockhampton,  but  thai</span><span>  there  has]  been  of  late  a  decrease  ir</span></p> <p><span>  in  the  value  of  fat  stock  in  the  colonies.</span><span>  The  reason  is  obvious.  The  advance</span></p> <p><span>  was  due  to  a  vigorous  prosecution  of  the</span><span>  meat-preserving  industry  ;  lite  decline  is</span><span>  thc  effect  of  its  suspension.  The  fluctu-</span><span>  ation  resulted  from  a  rush  of  competition</span></p> <p><span>  between  the  bulcher  arid  the  meat</span></p> <p><span>  preserver,  and  the  sudden  disappearance</span><span>  of  one  competitor  from  the  market.</span><span>  The  impetus  of  the  new  industry  sent</span><span>  prices  above  the  level  of  the  future,  and</span><span>  now  the  retrogression  will  possibly  be</span><span>  equally  marked.  A  renewal  of  the  pre-</span><span>  serving  process  will  soon  induce  another</span><span>  reaction  ;  but  the  oscillation  will  con-</span><span>  tinually  lessen,  and  soon  we  may  expect</span><span>  to  see  prices  attain  their  normal  level,</span><span>  and  be  subject  only  to  such  fluctuations</span><span>  as  may  be  caused  by  bad  or  good</span><span>  seasons,  and  the  varying  condition  of</span><span>  the  Jiuropean  demand  for  our  meat</span></p> <p><span>  manufactures.</span></p> <p><span>  'l'he  closing  of  the  largest  meat</span><span>  preserving  establishment  on  the  Fitzroy</span><span>  is  due,  we  believe,  to  exceptional  causes.</span><span>  It  is  no  new  thing  for  public  companies</span><span>  managet)  in  England  to  fail  in  Australia,</span><span>  and  il""  the  Central  Queensland  Meat</span><span>  Preserving  Company  do  not  prove  a</span><span>  commercial  success,  fen/  experienced</span><span>  colonists  will  feel  much  surprise.  The</span><span>  declining  ¡trice  of  fat  stock  and  tile</span><span>  approach  of  thc  cool  season,  may  possibly</span><span>  induce  a  resumption  of  the  works  by  the</span></p> <p><span>  Company.  If  not,  it  may  be  hoped  thal  1</span></p> <p><span>  lite  establishment  will  soon  pass  into</span></p> <p><span>  other  hands.  It  is  known  that  lije</span><span>  tinning  process  at  Lake's  Creek  is  a</span><span>  success,  that  the  Company's  manufac-</span><span>  tures  find  a  good  market,  and  that  (he</span><span>  works  have  all  the  appliances  rctjttisilc</span><span>  for  thc  business.  It  is  not  for  us  lo</span><span>  scrutinise  loo  narrowly  the  proceedings</span><span>  of  thc  Company,  but  its  prosperity  is  so</span><span>  bound  up  with  the  well-being  of  the  dis-</span><span>  trict,  that  we  cannot  regard  its  suspension</span><span>  without  deep  regret  and  anxiety.  And</span><span>  in  these  circumstances  we  are  justified</span><span>  in  adverting  to  the  prevalent  opinion</span><span>  that  the  expenses  of  management  are</span><span>  excessive.  locally  the  business  may</span><span>  be  well  conducted,  but  Queensland</span><span>  shareholders  exhibit  great  distrust  in  the</span><span>  management  of  thc  London  office.  Thc</span><span>  Lake's  Creek  works  do  not  stand  alone,</span><span>  and  many  persons  amongst  ns  can</span><span>  approximately  estimate  what  the  expen-</span><span>  diture  and  receipts  of  such  an</span><span>  establishment  should  be.  It  must  lie</span><span>  distinctly  understood  that  we  make  no</span><span>  charge  of  mismanagement  against  the</span><span>  Company,  or  any  of  its  officers.  We</span><span>  merely  record  the  very  general  belief</span><span>  that,  now  all  preliminary  expenses  have</span><span>  been  paid,  and  the  price  of  fat  stock  is</span><span>  likely  to  decline,  the  Company  ought  to</span><span>  be  able  to  carry  on  its  works  with  a</span><span>  remunerative  margin.  It  is  not  now  a</span><span>  question  whether  the  concern  mil  pay  a</span><span>  fair  percentage  on  the  capital  invested,</span><span>  but  whether  the  season's  operations</span><span>  would  show  a  reasonable  percentage  of</span><span>  profit.  Some  detailed  and  guaranteed</span></p> <p><span>  returns  from  another  establishment  are</span></p> <p><span>  now  before  us,  and  they  show  a  good</span><span>  percentage  of  profit  on  last  year's  opera</span><span>  lions.  We  find  also  thal  the  season</span></p> <p><span>  extended  over  two  months  only,  thal</span></p> <p><span>  the  establishment  was  worked  to  bul</span></p> <p><span>  one-h?lf  its  capacity,  and  that  the  prices</span><span>  paid  for  stock  were  extreme.  What  was</span><span>  possible  in  one  case,  should  be  found</span><span>  practicable  in  another,  and  hence  the</span><span>  dissatisfaction  to  which  we  have  already</span></p> <p><span>  adverted.</span></p> <p><span>  We  observe  that  a  project  is  on  fool</span><span>  for  placing  the  Laurel  Hank  works  in  the</span><span>  hands  of  a  local  company.

That  was  undoubtedly  a  mistake</span><span>  011  the  part  of  the  Council,  for  although</span><span>  no  practical  man  could  have  expected</span><span>  the  bridge  to  be  erected  for  any  such</span><span>  amount,  if  the  Government  had  begun</span><span>  the  work,  they  must  have  carried  it  out,</span><span>  at  whatever  cost,  and  the  Corporation</span><span>  would  have  escaped  a  burden  which  has</span><span>  botli  crippled  and  demoralised  il.</span></p> <p><span>  One  obstacle  to  the  taking  over  of  Ute</span><span>  bridge  was  suggested  by  Mr.  HEMMANT,</span><span>  the  Colonial  Treasurer.  The  Coqiora</span><span>  tion  debentures  bear  five  per  cent,</span><span>  interest,  whereas  thc  Government  can</span><span>  borrow  at  four-and-a-half.  Were  the</span></p> <p><span>  Council's  liability  taken  over  as  it  stands,</span><span>  j  tlierefore,  it  would  practically  exceed  by</span></p> <p><span>  some  thousands  the  nominal  amount,</span><span>  lint  Mr.  STF.WART  suggested  that  the</span><span>  holders  would  gladly  exchange  their  Cor-</span><span>  poration  debentures  for  Government</span><span>  ones,  which  is  not  al  all  improbable,  con-</span><span>  sidering  the  embarrassed  condition  of  the</span><span>  Corporation  finances.</span></p> <p><span>  The  difficulty  in  the  way  of  (he  Go-</span><span>  vernment  appears  lo  be  the  demand</span><span>  made  for  a  free  bridge.  The  condition,</span><span>  be  it  observed,  is  not  made  by  the</span><span>  MAYOR,  or  either  of  the  Aldermen,  who</span><span>  joined  in  the  deputation.  The  pre-</span><span>  sumption  is  that  the  Corporation  would</span><span>  be  glad  lo  get  rid  of  the  bridge  on  any</span><span>  terms.  When  once  out  of  their  hands,</span><span>  il  will  be  no  business  of  theirs  whether</span><span>  lolls  be  levied  or  not.

Hut  that  course</span><span>  does  not  meei  the  views  of  the  Brisbane</span></p> <p><span>  members,  who  apparently  consider  them-</span><span>  selves  strong  enough,  with  the  aid  of  the</span><span>  Ministry,  to  carry  a  loan  for  a</span><span>  free  bridge.  In  tin's  we  believe  they  are</span><span>  mistaken,  for  a  free  bridge  at  Brisbane</span><span>  would  necessitate  provision  for  free</span><span>  bridges  elsewhere.  No  case  for  excep-</span><span>  tional  treatment  can  be  made  ont  in</span><span>  favour  of  Brisbane  in  this  matter.  Thal</span><span>  it  is  the  metropolis  of  the  colony,-that</span><span>  the  Corporation  hold  a  Crown  Giant  of</span><span>  certain  bridge  lands,-and  that  it  was</span><span>  originally  supposed  the  railway  terminus</span><span>  would  be  on  the  south  side,-are  no</span><span>  justification  for  laking  the  bridge  over</span><span>  at  a  cost  of  j£i  20,000,  and  throwing  it</span><span>  open  lo  the  public.  If  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  were  prepared  to  admit  that</span><span>  a  huge  blunder  had  been  made  in</span><span>  interfering  willi  the  bridge,  and</span><span>  that  owing  lo  thal  blunder  the  Corpora-</span><span>  tion  had  suffered  lo  such  an  extent  that</span><span>  the  public  revenue  was  fairly  chargeable</span><span>  with  the  whole  cost  of  the  structure,  the</span><span>  way  to  accept  Mr.  STEWART'S  proposal</span><span>  would  he  clear.  But  as  malters  stand,</span><span>  we  think  it  would  be  more  prudent  lo</span><span>  consent  to  the  imposition  of  a  loll,  if  it</span><span>  be  really  desired  to  relieve  thc  Corpora-</span><span>  tion  revenues  of  the  liabilities  which</span><span>  burden  them.</span></p> <p><span>  lt  is  worth  noticing  that  the  MINISTER</span><span>  for  Woutis,  who  was  present,  and  into</span><span>  whose  department  Ihc  bridge  would  fall,</span><span>  made  no  sign,  lt  would  have  been  in-</span><span>  teresting  to  leam  whether  thc  hon.</span><span>  gentleman  would  apply  to  a  metropoli-</span><span>  tan  deputation  the  arguments  he  lately</span><span>  used  at  Rockhampton.

That</span><span>  any  change  in  the  law  in  these  respects</span><span>  will  be  made  during  the  impending</span><span>  session  is  improbable.  Indeed  it  may</span><span>  be  apprehended  that  the  session  will  not</span><span>  be  fruitful  in  legislation  of  any  kind.</span><span>  Honorable  members  know  too  little  of</span><span>  each  other's  opinions  and  capacities  lo</span><span>  warrant  the  belief  that  any  attempt</span><span>  to  settle  great  constitutional  problems</span><span>  will  be  successful.  The  probability</span><span>  ts  that  the  passing  of  some  patch-</span><span>  work  measures,  the  two  sets  of</span><span>  Estimates,  and  some  abstract  resolutions,</span><span>  will  absorb  so  much  of  the  time  of  the</span><span>  House,  that  measures  involving  organic</span><span>  changes  will  be  thrown  over  till  the</span><span>  following  session.  In  politics,  however,</span><span>  there  is  so  little  ground  on  which  to</span><span>  base  prediction,  thal  the  best  informed</span><span>  writer  must  feel  that  in  venturing  to  ex-</span><span>  press  an  opinion  lie  lakes  an  almost</span><span>  unwarrantable  leap  in  the  dark.  There-</span><span>  fore  should  the  pertinacity  of  Mr.  Ftfz</span><span>  CURAM),  or  the  eloquence  of  his</span><span>  northern  colleagues,  induce  Parliament</span><span>  lo  pass  a  financial  separation  bill,  the</span><span>  public  would  only  be  treated  to  one  of</span><span>  those  surprises  which  may  be  constantly</span><span>  looked  for  in  the  working  of  responsible</span><span>  government  in  thc  colonies.</span></p> <p><span>  As  stated  in  a  former  article,  we  do</span><span>  not'  believe  either  House  of  Legislature</span><span>  will  entertain  a  measure  granting  financial</span><span>  or  territorial  separation  dt  Cape  Palmer-</span><span>  ston.  The  only  possible  kind  of  legis</span><span>  I  lation  at  the  present  time,  we  think,</span><span>  would  have  a  precisely  opposite  tendency.</span><span>  Thc  desire  of  most  politicians  now-a-days</span><span>  is  to  unite  and  not  to  divide.  Mr.</span><span>  FII'Z&lt;;I:HAI.I>,  even  professes  to  treat</span><span>  separation  as  an  undesirable  alternative,</span><span>  and  would  prefer  union  on  some</span><span>  perfectly  fair  and  equitable  basis.</span><span>  It  is,  he  avers,  only  because  such</span><span>  union  is  impracticable'  that  he  would</span><span>  dissolve  the  existing  connection  between</span><span>  north  and  south,  lt  therefore  becomes</span></p> <p><span>  a  question  which  all  public  men  should</span><span>  earnestly  consider,  whether  permanent</span><span>  and  satisfactory  union  is  attain-</span><span>  able  or  not.  If  it  be,  we  think</span><span>  the  overwhelming'  balance  of  legislative</span><span>  opinion  will  pronounce  in  favour  of  a</span><span>  lasting  connection,  bul  if  that  be  deemed</span><span>  not  attainable,  the  advisability  of  a</span><span>  friendly  separation  will  hardly  be  ques-</span></p> <p><span>  tioned.</span></p> <p><span>  We  venture  to  hazard  the  opinion  that</span><span>  by  judicious  measures  the  colony  of</span><span>  Queensland  may  be  kept  intact,  and</span><span>  such  a  national  spirit  created  amongst  the</span><span>  people  that  north,  south,  east,  and  west</span><span>  may  be  induced  with  complacency  to</span><span>  regard  themselves  as  but  parts  of  a  great</span><span>  whole.  All  the  advantages  derivable  from</span><span>  separation  may  be  obtained  by  sub-</span><span>  division.  The  people  under  a  wise  local</span><span>  government  law  might  bc  allowed  to</span><span>  manage  their  om»  affairs,  to  spend</span><span>  their  own  money,  and  to  enjoy  as  much</span><span>  real  liberty  as  they  could  obtain  by</span><span>  dividing  north  from  south,  or  by  splitting</span><span>  up  the  colony  into  three  or  four  distinct</span><span>  and  semi-hostile  provinces.  AH  that</span><span>  appears  to  us  necessary  to  this  happy</span><span>  result  is  a  willingness  on  the  part  oí</span><span>  Ministers  to  relinquish  the  patronage</span><span>  and  functions  which  properly  appertain</span><span>  to  local  bodies,  and  an  earnest  desire  on</span><span>  the  part  of  the  Legislature  to  enfranchise</span><span>  each  district  with  full  statutory  powers  to</span><span>  administer  its  own  affairs.</span></p> <p><span>  But  simple  as  this  process  may</span><span>  appear,  it  is  practically  one  surrounded</span><span>  by  great  difficulty.  At  thc  very  outset,</span></p> <p><span>  it  would  be  necessary  in  attempt-1</span></p> <p><span>  ing  legislation,  to  agree  to  a  de-</span><span>  finition  of  terms.  lt  having  been</span><span>  affirmed  that  a  severance  should  be</span><span>  made  between  local  and  general  expen-</span><span>  diture,  there  would  be  a  wide  difference</span><span>  of  opinion  as  to  what  were  general  and</span><span>  what  «'ero  merely  local  works.  The</span><span>  present  Ministry,  for  example,  call  rail-</span><span>  ways,  main  roads,  and  costly  bridges</span><span>  national  works,  while  Mr.  FITZGERALD</span><span>  and  his  political  associates  denominate</span><span>  them  all  local  works.  The  present</span><span>  Ministry,  wc  fear,  would  never  consent  to</span><span>  relinquish  die  directcontrol  of  such  under-</span><span>  takings,  and  therefore,  so  long  as  they</span><span>  retain  power,  railways,  main  roads,  and</span><span>  expensive  bridges  will  be  dealt  with  as</span><span>  national  works,  and  made  a  charge</span><span>  upon  the  Consolidated  Revenue  of  the</span><span>  colony.  Bul  the  present  Government  is</span><span>  not  unchangeable  or  inevitable,  and</span><span>  circumstances  may  induce  a  modification</span><span>  of  its  views  on  this  point,  or  Ministers</span><span>  ceasing  to  represent  the  majority  in  the</span><span>  House  may  be  required  to  give  way  to</span><span>  other  men.  There  is  reason  to  believe,</span><span>  however,  that  even  the  PKKMIF.K  is  ready</span><span>  to  admit  thc  advisableness  of  decentral-</span><span>  isation  of  some  kind,  while  some  of  his</span><span>  colleagues  are  prepared  to  go  a  long  way</span><span>  towards  meeting  the  demands  of  the</span><span>  warme  it  advocates  of  local  government.</span></p> <p><span>  Although,  in  a  certain  sense,  railways</span><span>  and  main  roads  arc  national  works,</span><span>  inasmuch  as  their  construction  tends  to</span></p> <p><span>  foster  the  progress  of  the  colony,  they  do</span><span>  not  benefit  all  parts  of  the  colony  alike.</span><span>  A  railway  from  Brisbane  to  the  Darling</span><span>  Downs  benefits  the  Kennedy  district</span><span>  about  as  much  as  Victoria,  and  if</span><span>  the  people  of  the  Kennedy  arc</span><span>  taxed  to  pay  for  such  a  railway,</span><span>  they  have  a  legitimate  cause  of  grievance.</span><span>  In  Queensland,  therefore,  railways  must</span><span>  be  treated  as  district,  not  as  national</span><span>  works,  if  ever  the  whole  colony  is  to  be</span><span>  dealt  justly  by.  And  as  the  several</span><span>  districts  are  marked  by  distinct  geographi-</span><span>  cal  features,  their  boundaries  might  be</span><span>  easily  defined.  Were  this  preliminary</span><span>  basis  of  action  agreed  upon,  one  great</span><span>  obstacle  to  a  satisfactory  settlement  of</span><span>  the  local  government  question  would  be</span></p> <p><span>  removed.

It  has</span><span>  been  thought  expedient  that,  subject  to</span><span>  the  proviso  against  differential  duties,</span><span>  the  powers  given  to  the  Colonial  Legis-</span></p> <p><span>  latures  should  be  extended  to  articles</span><span>  not  the  growth,  produce,  and  manufacture</span><span>  of  Australia  or  New  Zealand,  in  order  to</span><span>  remove  all  doubts  as  to  such  arrange-</span><span>  ments  as  have  already  been  made  as  to</span><span>  border  duties  between  Victoria  and  New</span><span>  South  Wales,  and  also  to  enable  a  Cus-</span><span>  toms  Union  to  be  established  between</span></p> <p><span>  any  two  or  more  of  the  colonies  to  which</span><span>  the  Act  applies.  A  careful  perusal  of</span><span>  the  third  section  must,  we  think,  con-</span><span>  vince  the  reader  that  full  power  is  given</span><span>  to  the  colonies  to  mutually  agree  to</span><span>  intercolonial  free  trade,  or  to  establish</span><span>  any  form  of  tariff  they  may  think  proper</span><span>  as  between  themselves,  provided  only</span><span>  that  they  must  not  impose  differential</span><span>  duties  on  articles  imported  from  other</span><span>  countries.  The  term  ""  country,""  section</span><span>  2  says,  ""  shall  mean  any  country  or  place</span><span>  except  Australian  Colonies,  and  the</span><span>  Colony  of  New  Zealand.""  The  colonies</span><span>  named  may  therefore  .establish  any  tariff</span><span>  they  please,  or  none  at  all,  on  articles</span><span>  passing  from  one  to  another  of  these</span><span>  colonies,  but  importations  from  places</span><span>  beyond,  whether  foreign  countries</span><span>  or  British  possessions,  must  be  treated</span><span>  with  perfect  equality.  In  short,  the</span><span>  Act  enables  the  colonies  of  Australia</span><span>  and  New  Zealand  to  regard  themselves</span><span>  for  fiscal  purposes  as  one  country,  so</span><span>  that  each  colony  shall  occupy  a  similar</span><span>  position  in  relation  to  other  colonies</span><span>  included  in  the  group  as  one  state  in</span><span>  America  occupies  with  regard  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  other  states  of  the  Union.

The  meeting  laboured  under</span><span>  a  great  disadvantage  from  the  want  of</span><span>  information  as  to  the  nature  of  the</span><span>  debate  in.  the  House  on  this  question,</span><span>  the  views  expressed  by  hon.  members,</span><span>  and  the  sides  taken  by  them  re-</span><span>  spectively  in  the  division.  The  only</span><span>  intelligence  at  that  lime  to  hand  was</span><span>  furnished  by  two  or  three  brief  telegrams,</span><span>  which  beyond  stating  the  bare  faci  that</span><span>  Bowen  had  been  fixed  as  the  place  of</span><span>  residence,  only  told  us  that  on  the</span><span>  following  night,  when  the  motion  for  a</span><span>  re-cast  bf  the  Surplus  Estimate  was  under</span><span>  discussion,  the  COLONIAL  TTEASURF.R</span><span>  took  occasion  to  remark,  in  the  course</span><span>  of  his  defence  of  the  Government</span><span>  allocation  of  the  public  Expenditure,</span><span>  that  the  vote  fixing  the  residence  of  the</span><span>  Northern  Judge  had  settled  the  question</span><span>  that  Separation  would  be  at  Cape</span><span>  Palmerston,  and  not  at  Dawes  Range  ;</span><span>  and  that  the  Central  Districts  should</span><span>  therefore  make  up  their  minds  to  cast  in</span><span>  their  lot  with  Queensland.  We  are</span><span>  further  told  in  reference  to  this</span><span>  matter,  that  Mr.  PALMER  expressed</span><span>  surprise  at  the  honorable  MINISTER</span><span>  mentioning  Separation  as  he  thought  it</span><span>  was  a  great  mistake  ;  but  he  warned  the</span><span>  Government  that  if  the  Central  Districts</span><span>  were  not  properly  treated,  Separation</span><span>  would  not  alone  be  at  Cape  Palmerston.</span><span>  It  was  but  natural,  therefore,  that  the</span><span>  speakers  at  the  meeting  the  other  night</span><span>  attributed  this  décision  to  Government</span><span>  influence  and  connected  it  with  the</span></p> <p><span>  I  general  policy  of  the  present  ministers  in</span><span>  I  regard  to  the  Central  Districts  of  the</span><span>  I  colony.  To  understand  the  situation</span></p> <p><span>  fairly,  it  is  necessary  to  bear  in  mind</span><span>  that  scarcely  had  the  Ministry  entered</span><span>  office  when  an  intimation  was  given  to</span><span>  the  member  for  Rockhampton  that  the</span><span>  Government  intended  to  distribute  their</span><span>  favours  upon  the  assumption  that</span><span>  the  Central  Districts  had  of  late</span><span>  years  been  dealt  with  too  liberally</span><span>  and  should  now  stand  aside  whilst</span><span>  other  districts  were  bountifully  cared  for.</span><span>  And  although  subsequent  ministerial</span><span>  promises  and  expressions  of  kindly  regard</span><span>  towards  this  part  of  the  colony  encouraged</span><span>  us  momentarily  to  indulge  the  hope  that</span><span>  ministers  liad  thought  better  of  it  and</span><span>  abandoned  their  evil  intentions,  thc  publi-</span><span>  cation  of  the  Estimates  showed  that  our</span><span>  early  fears  were  only  too  well  founded.</span><span>  In  tile  proposed  expenditure  on  roads</span><span>  and  bridges  and  other  improvements,  the</span><span>  Estimates  in  chief  displayed  a  determi-</span><span>  nation  to  mark  out  the  Central  Division</span><span>  as  the  object  of  their  undisguised  dislike.</span><span>  And  this  antagonistic  feeling  was  further</span><span>  shown  in  the  terms  of  the  coastwise  mail</span><span>  contract  entered  into  by  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  without  parliamentary  sanction</span><span>  being  asked  for,  and  by  which  the  A.S.N.</span><span>  Company,  in  consideration  of  the  postal</span><span>  subsidy,  were  required  lo  discontinue</span><span>  their  practice  of  making  Rockhampton</span><span>  a  port  of  call.  The  Government  had</span><span>  evidently  felt  the  pulse  of  the</span><span>  new  Parliament,  and  made  such</span><span>  overtures  to  the  members  representing</span><span>  the  extreme  nortli  as  would  enable  them</span><span>  to  carry  out  their  views.  Tile  Central</span><span>  Division  had  deeply  wounded  the  feel-</span><span>  ings  of  the  leaders  of  the  southern</span><span>  party  :  having  succeeded,  after  a  hard</span><span>  struggle,  in  putting  a  stop  on  southern</span><span>  schemes  of  aggrandisement,  and  secured</span><span>  thc  extension  of  the  Northern  Railway</span><span>  and  the  introduction  of  a  system  of  fair</span><span>  dealing  towards  all  parts  of  tho  country.</span><span>  Hut  the  head  and  front  of  thc</span><span>  offending  appears  to  be  that  the</span><span>  Palmer  Ministry  were  instrumental</span><span>  in  bringing  about  thc  change.</span><span>  The  extreme  north,  having  taken  an</span><span>  almost  passive  stand  during  thc  conflict,</span><span>  owing  mainly  to  the  circumstance  that</span><span>  the  residents  of  those  distant  parts  were</span></p> <p><span>  too  much  absorbed  in  the  work  of</span></p> <p><span>  pioneer  settlement  to  interest  them-</span><span>  selves  deeply  in  public  questions,  did</span><span>  not  excite  the  resentment  of  the</span><span>  Southern  party  and  their  leaders.  It  is</span><span>  foi  these  reasons  that  the  members  re-</span><span>  presenting  the  territory  north  of  Cape</span><span>  Palmerston  are  treated  tenderly  by  the</span><span>  present  Ministry,  and  their  co-operation</span><span>  secured  at  all  hazards.  Rockhampton</span><span>  and  the  Central  Districts  generally  must</span><span>  bc  punished  for  their  contumacy  in  the</span><span>  past  towards  the  south,  and  their  grateful</span><span>  adhesion  to  the  Palmer  Ministry;  and  so</span><span>  it  happens  that  a  policy  of  retaliation</span><span>  against  thc  Central  Districts  is  being</span><span>  successfully  pursued,  and  that  ""Her</span><span>  MAJESTY'S  Opposition""  is  at  the  present</span><span>  time  almost  exclusively  made  up  of  the</span><span>  representatives  of  the  part  of  the  colony</span><span>  against  which  Ulis  hostility  is  directed.</span></p> <p><span>  The  division  of  parties  in  the  House  i</span><span>  can  no  longer  be  said  to  represent  pro-  i</span><span>  gressive  Liberalism  on  one  side,  and  i</span></p> <p><span>  humdrum  Conservatism  on  the  other,  i</span><span>  For,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  the  conserva-  !</span><span>  lives,  or  squatters,  as  a  party  have  no</span><span>  organised  existence,  and  the  leader  of</span><span>  the  present  Opposition  has  proved  him-</span><span>  self  really  more  liberal  and  progressive</span><span>  than  the  leaders  of  the  so-called  Liberal</span></p> <p><span>  party.  Mr.  PALMER  signalised  his  term</span><span>  of  power  by  fair  dealing  and  honesty  of</span><span>  ?purpose  ;  and,  with  the  aid  of  able</span><span>  :colleagues,  connived  to  do  what  perhaps</span><span>  no  other  mah  in  the  colony  could  have</span><span>  done.  The  course  of  extravagance  was</span></p> <p><span>  stayed  ;  the  annually  recuning  deficits  j</span></p> <p><span>  were  made  to  give  place  to  annually  ;</span><span>  recurring  surpluses  ;  and  the  improved</span><span>  financial  position  of  the  colony  was</span></p> <p><span>  availed  of  to  give  to  the  central  and  out-  1</span><span>  lying  districts  a  more  equitable  participa-</span><span>  tion  in  the  public  expenditure  than  had</span><span>  hitherto  been  accorded  them.  ""  Dis-</span><span>  appointed  Southern  politicians  called  the</span><span>  Palmer  Government  ""humdrum""  and</span><span>  retrogressive  ;  but  acts  speaks  louder  than</span><span>  words,  and  the  people  of  the  Central  Dis-</span><span>  tricts  know  how  to  appreciate  real  worth,</span></p> <p><span>  and  they  regard  the  ex-Premier  as  not  only  ;</span><span>  a  statesman  of  liberal  and  progressive  ,</span><span>  principles  but  as  their  true  friend.  |</span></p> <p><span>  It  has  been  said  that  an  unholy  .</span><span>  alliance  has  been  made  by  the  present</span></p> <p><span>  Government  with  the  members  of  the  I</span><span>  extreme  north.  Whether  this  be  literally</span><span>  true  or  not,  we  are  not  concerned  to</span><span>  .  i-iimv;_  we  are,  however,  thoroughly</span></p> <p><span>  satisfied  that  tne  action  uf  iiic  enveni-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  and  the  members  of  the  new1</span><span>  Assembly  gives  at  least  a  colour</span><span>  of  reasonableness  to  the  report,</span><span>  for  the  Estimates  have  been  carried  in</span><span>  spite  of  their  flagrant  partiality  and  un-</span></p> <p><span>  fairness,  and  upon  every  question  affect-^</span><span>  ing  the  relative  claims  of  the  three</span><span>  principal  divisions  of  the  colony  respec-</span><span>  tively,  the  action  of  the  House,  the</span><span>  Government  party  has  represented  south</span><span>  and  north  in  opposition  to  the  Central</span></p> <p><span>  Division.  The  Estimates  were  mani-</span></p> <p><span>  festly  unfair  as  to  the  distribution  of</span><span>  Expenditure  for  public  works,  and  they</span></p> <p><span>  were  shown  to  be  so.  Mr.  M'ILWKAI'J'H</span></p> <p><span>  assumed  great  ignorance  as  ¡o  the</span><span>  manner  in  which  the  public  moneys  had</span><span>  hitherto  been  spent  mainly  for  tile  advan-</span><span>  tage  of  the  Southern  Division,  and  made</span><span>  the  assertion  that,  as  far  as  his  nun</span><span>  department  was  concerned,  whatever</span><span>  might  have  taken  place  in  previous  years,</span><span>  he  could  say  that  in  1873  people  of</span><span>  this  part  of  the  colony  received  an  expen-</span><span>  diture  double  the  amount  per  head  of</span><span>  the  population  in  other  districts  in  that</span><span>  particular  year.  But  even  this  statement,</span><span>  applying  as  it  did  only  to  the  Depart-</span><span>  ment  of  Public  Works  during  the  period</span><span>  when  the  Central  Districts  were</span></p> <p><span>  undeniably  liberally  treated  as  compared</span><span>  with  the  conduct  of  the  Brisbane  Govern-</span><span>  ment  towards  them  in  previous</span><span>  years,  was  incontestibly  disproved</span><span>  by  an  official  statement  of  revenue</span><span>  and  expenditure  of  the  respective  dis-</span><span>  tricts  laid  upon  the  table  of  the  House.</span><span>  Notwithstanding  the  stern  logic  oriacts</span><span>  thus  brought  prominently  under  notice,</span><span>  the  Estimates  arc  allowed  to  pass.  How</span></p> <p><span>  hon.  members  satisfied  their  consciences</span><span>  we  cannot  tell.  The  MINISTER  FOR</span></p> <p><span>  WORKS,  however,  gave  the  cue  to</span><span>  wavering  minds  by  pointing  out  that</span><span>  although  the  Central  Division  had  less</span><span>  than  its  fair  share  of  expenditure  from</span><span>  the  Consolidated  Revenue,  it  was  receiv-</span><span>  ing  the  benefit  of  the  half-million  loan</span><span>  money  in  the  extension  of  the  railway  in</span><span>  progress.  This  consideration  might,</span><span>  however,  be  entitled  to  weight,  if  it  were</span><span>  made  equally  applicable  to  the</span><span>  South,  where  lhere  has  been  a  much</span><span>  larger  expenditure  on  railways.  But  the</span><span>  argument  is  unfortunately  one-sided,  and</span><span>  reminds  one  forcibly  of  the  ""  Lion  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  Fable.""</span></p> <p><span>  So  much  for  the  estimates.  Tile  same</span><span>  style  of  conduct  characterised  the  House</span><span>  in  dealing  with  the  question  ot  a  Judge</span><span>  for  the  North,  and  his  place  of  residence.</span><span>  We  form  our  opinion  from  the  abstract</span><span>  of  the  debate  furnished  by  the  Courier,</span><span>  which  is  published  in  another  column  of</span><span>  the  Bulletin  to-day.  This  report,  we</span><span>  suppose,  professes  to  give  the  leading</span><span>  remark  of  each  speaker.  If  so,  it  is</span><span>  passing  strange  how  the  question  was</span><span>  treated.  It  seems  to  us  that  the  very</span><span>  essence  of  the  necessity  for  a  ""  resident  ""</span><span>  Judge,  implies  that  the  judge  is  not</span><span>  merely  to  travel  periodically  and  hold</span><span>  circuit  courts  in  different  parts  of</span><span>  his  district,  but  to  preside  over</span><span>  a  branch  of  the  Supreme  Court  esta-</span><span>  blished  in  some  centre  of  population</span><span>  having  a  considerable  amount  of  legal</span><span>  business.  And  it  was  the  want  fell  at</span><span>  Rockhampton  lhat  gave  rise  to  thc</span><span>  demand  for  a  resident  Judge.  This</span><span>  town  has  for  some  years  past  been  the</span><span>  only  assize  town  in  connecliou  with  the</span><span>  Supreme  Court  for  the  whole  of  the</span><span>  colony  from  Dawes  Range  northwards.</span></p> <p><span>  lt  was  made  an  assize  town  because  it</span></p> <p><span>  had  a  considerable  population  itself  and</span><span>  represented  a  very  extensive  inland</span><span>  district  besides.  But  hall-yearly  visita-</span><span>  tions  by  one  of  thc  Brisbane  Judges  do  not</span><span>  adequately  meet  the  growing  wants  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  i  town  and  district.  In  civil  business  es-</span></p> <p><span>  pecially,  great  loss  and  expense  are  en-</span><span>  tailed  upon  the  community,  owing  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  [  system  by  which  all  legal  business  that</span></p> <p><span>  cannot  be  done  during  the  sittings  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Circuit  Court  has  to  be  transacted  in</span><span>  Brisbane,  tims  involving  expense  in</span><span>  employment  of  agents  and  in  other  ways,</span><span>  which  often  amounts  to  a  practical  denial</span></p> <p><span>  of  justice.  A  branch  of  the  Supreme  |</span><span>  Court  in  Rockhampton  and  a  Resident  j</span><span>  Judge  would  therefore  be  a  great  boon,</span><span>  and  the  districts  further  northward  might</span></p> <p><span>  still  have  their  Circuit  Courts,  and  in  j</span><span>  reality  have  all  the  advantage  from  the  |</span><span>  appointment  of  a  Northern  Judge  which</span><span>  they  could  enjoy  were  he  resident</span><span>  at  Bowen.

F.  MERRY  and  ¡</span><span>  Mr.  JOHN  BUHOT.  The  former  seeks</span></p> <p><span>  compensation  for  an  error  in  the  Real  I</span><span>  Property  Office,  and  has  so  far  esta-</span><span>  blished  his  claim  in  the  judgment  of  the</span><span>  Select  Committee  that  they  have  recom-</span><span>  mended  a  vote  of  £1500  to  recoup  the</span><span>  petitioner  for  his  losses.  In  the  matter</span><span>  of  Mr.  BUHOT'S  petition,  the  Com-</span><span>  mittee  recommend  a  grant  of  500  acres</span><span>  ol'  land  as  a  reward  for  his  effort  in  in-</span></p> <p><span>  troducing  sugar  cultivation  into  the  j</span></p> <p><span>  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  The  particulars  of  Mr.  MERRY'S  losses</span><span>  are  briefly  these  :-Some  years  ago  the</span><span>  petitioner  bought  from  the  Australian</span><span>  Mutual  Provident  Society  a  piece  of</span><span>  laud  situated  at  Toowoomba,  receiving</span><span>  from  the  Society  a  transfer  dated  29th</span><span>  April,  1870,  in  which  it  was  stated  that</span><span>  t)ie  land  formed  a  portion  of  the  pro-</span><span>  perty  comprised  in  certificate  of  title  No.</span><span>  16,864  issued  to  the  Society.  The</span><span>  petitioner  lodged  the  transfer  in  the</span><span>  Real  Property  Office,  and  on  their  side</span><span>  the  Society  deposited  a  plan  showing  the</span><span>  Yal  ii  i  t  subdivisions  of  which  that  sold</span><span>  lt  Mr.  MERRY  was  one.  On  the  7th</span><span>  November  following,  a  certificate  of</span><span>  title  was  issued  by  the  REGISTRAR</span><span>  GI  A'F.RAI.  to  the  petitioner,  who  naturally</span><span>  supposed  bis  title  to  be  indefeasible.  But</span><span>  on  the  22nd  March,  1872,  he  was  ejected</span><span>  from  the  land  by  the  Sheriff  of  Queens</span><span>  and,  at  thc  suit  of  another  person,  who,</span><span>  as  representative  of  the  mortgagee,</span><span>  claimed  thc  property  as  included  in  a</span><span>  certificate  of  title  issued  in  thc  year</span><span>  1866,  to  GEORGE  M'CULTJOCH  REED.</span><span>  ""  It  appears  to  yourCommittee,""  says  the</span><span>  report,  ""that  the  petitioner  was  so  ejected</span></p> <p><span>  ""  because  the  land  transferred  to  him</span><span>  ""  was  not  included  in,  and  did  not  form</span><span>  ""  part  of  the  land  comprised  in  the  cer</span><span>  ""  lificate  of  lille  held  by  the  society.""  It</span><span>  seems  further  that  in  issuing  the  certifi-</span><span>  cate  to  MERRY  in  error,  the  REGISTRAR</span><span>  {Jr.NKKAi.  was  misled  by  a  plan  prepared</span><span>  by  a  licensed  surveyor  named  SWANN  ;</span></p> <p><span>  but  it  is  also  held  that  had  the  plan  been</span><span>  compared  with,  and  checked  by  the  plans</span><span>  in  the  Real  Properly  Act  Office,  the  error</span><span>  would  not  liave  occurred.  But  a  very</span><span>  serious  errorit  proved  for  Mr.  MERRY,  and</span><span>  his  creditors.  Relying  on  the  validity  of</span><span>  his  title  he  had  erected  on  the  land  a</span><span>  store  and  other  improvements  to  the</span><span>  value  of  ^1000,  which  were  lost  to  him</span><span>  on  his  ejectment;  as,  although  he  re-</span><span>  covered  thc  original  purchase-money  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  land  from  the  Mutual  Provident</span></p> <p><span>  Society,  the  loss  of  his  premises  brought</span><span>  about  a  crisis  in  his  affairs,  and  his  stock</span><span>  and  property  were  sacrificed  to  meet  the</span><span>  claims  of  his  creditors.  The  Committee</span><span>  ascertained  that  the  petitioner,  at  the</span><span>  time  of  his  ejection,  was  in  a  solvent</span><span>  condition,  his  assets  being  valued  at</span><span>  £9100,  and  his  liabilities  being  £7684.</span><span>  The  personal  loss  to  Mr.  MERRV</span><span>  was  therefore  £1416,  but  the</span><span>  loss  to  his  creditors,  through  compulsory</span><span>  realisation,  was  £3298.  With  the</span><span>  latter  amount,  however,  the  Committee</span><span>  seem  not  lo  have  concerned  themselves,</span><span>  their  recommendation  only  covering  the</span><span>  actual  loss  sustained  by  the  petitioner</span></p> <p><span>  himself.</span></p> <p><span>  In  this  case  the  petitioner,  unlike  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  P.  F.  MACDONALD,  was  not  possessed  of</span><span>  the  means  to  bring  an  action  against  thc</span><span>  Government.  But  the  probability  is,</span><span>  that  had  he  done  so,  the  result  would</span></p> <p><span>  have  been  thc  same.  The  cases  are  j</span><span>  analagous  in  the  respect  that  the  losses  j</span><span>  arose  through  official  errors,  and  there  j</span><span>  can  be  no  room  for  doubt  that  both  these  j</span></p> <p><span>  claimants  are  entitled  to  substantial</span><span>  compensation.  That  the  recommen-</span></p> <p><span>  dation  in  each  case  will  be  adopted  there  j</span><span>  is  every  reason  to  hope,  and  thus</span><span>  two  grave  public  scandals  will  be  removed</span><span>  from  public  notice.</span></p> <p><span>  The  claim  of  Mr.  BUHOT  IS,  however,</span><span>  a  different  matter  altogether.  He  asks</span><span>  a  reward  from  thc  Legislature,  as  being</span><span>  the  first  person  who  actually  made</span><span>  granula'ed  sugar  in  Queensland,  and  as</span><span>  having  by  letters  to  the  newspapers</span><span>  excited  interest  in  sugar  cultivation,</span></p> <p><span>  which  would  not  otherwise  have  attached</span><span>  to  it.  He  also  claims  consideration  for</span></p> <p><span>  having  rendered  practical  assistance  by</span><span>  advice  to  many  inexperienced  sugar</span><span>  planters,  both  in  the  Moreton  and  Wide</span><span>  Bay  districts.  The  Committee,  after</span><span>  inquiry,  find  that  Mr.  BUHOT  greatly</span><span>  contributed  to  the  permanent  and  speedy</span><span>  establishment  of  the  industry  of  sugar</span><span>  growing  in  this  colony,  and  they  recom-</span><span>  mend  that  a  free  grant  of  500  acres  of</span><span>  land  should  bc  given  to  him  as  a  reward</span><span>  for  his  services.  Seeing  that  sonic  years</span><span>  ago  the  Legislature  granted  2000  acres</span><span>  of  land  to  Captain  HOPE,  as  the  first</span><span>  colonist  who  had  embarked  capital  in</span><span>  sugar-groiving,  it  may  be  hoped  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  smaller  reward  will  not  be  refused  to  Mr.</span><span>  BUHOT,  whose  previous  successful  ex-</span><span>  periments  in  sugar  manufacture  mainly</span><span>  induced  Captain  HOPE  to  embark  in  his</span><span>  enterprise.</span></p> <p><span>  ~;  7-_  .  ._  .</span></p> ",Article,1874-07-08,"The Rockhampton Bulletin, WITH WHICH IS INCORPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER.

It  is</span><span>  quite  true  thal  at  the  outset  no  one  sup-</span><span>  posed  the  young  colony  would  be  left  to</span><span>  grapple  with  the  difficulty  and  expense</span><span>  unaided.  While  the  preliminaries  wore</span><span>  being  arranged,  lhere  was  an  under-</span><span>  standing  among  the  colonies  that  the</span><span>  ""three  routes  should  be  kept  open  at</span><span>  their  joint  expense,  '('here  was  to  be  a</span><span>  rateable  contribution  in  proportion  lo  the</span><span>  weight  of  mails  from  cadi,  and  all  were</span><span>  to  participate  as  equally  as  practicable</span><span>  in  the  benefits  of  the  several  services.</span></p> <p><span>  The  project  was  an  excellent  one,  and  if</span><span>  afterwards  found  impracticable  as  a  joint</span><span>  transaction,  it  has  been  virtually  carried</span><span>  out  through  the  enterprise  or  rivalry  of</span><span>  three  of  the  colonies.  Queensland  was</span><span>  the  weakest  of  the  trio,  and  the  service</span><span>  she  has  established  through  Tories  Strait</span><span>  is  consequently  the  least  efficient  of  all.</span><span>  Still,  considering  that  she  has  undertaken</span><span>  to  develope  a  practically  new  mail  route,</span></p> <p><span>  and  that  she  has  aimed  to  accommodate</span><span>  all  the  chief  ports  on  her  extended  coast-</span><span>  line,  the  prospects  of  the  service  are  not</span><span>  by  any  means  discouraging.  .Al  present</span><span>  il  is  only  in  the  initial  stage,  being  chiefly</span><span>  carried  on  by  chartered  steamers.  Hut</span><span>  when  the  fine  vessels  now  building  for</span><span>  thc  contractors  are  completed,  we  may</span><span>  look  forward  to  the  new  line  proving  of</span><span>  substantial  benefit  to  the  colony,  and  to</span><span>  its  conferring  increased  postal  facilities</span><span>  upon  thc  Australia*  generally.</span></p> <p><span>  Some  information  with  respect  lo  the</span><span>  new  service  has  reached  us,  which  will</span><span>  assist  the  reader  in  forming  an  estimate  of</span><span>  its  prospective  advantages.  The  contrata</span><span>  time  at  present  is  fifty-five  days,  the</span><span>  average  speed  required  being  nine  knots,</span><span>  with  five  ports  of  call  on  the  Queensland</span><span>  coast-line.  In  these  days  a  nine-knot</span><span>  speed-is  but  slow,  and  the  time  is  further</span><span>  prolonged  by  the  intricacies  of  the  Inner</span><span>  Passage,  which  compel  the  boals  to  anchor</span><span>  during  three  successive  nights,  thus  involv-</span><span>  ing  a  detention  of  thirty-six  hours.  This</span><span>  might  be  remedied  by  tile  erection  of</span><span>  additional  light-houses,  the  expense  of</span><span>  which  should  be  jointly  home  hy  all  the</span><span>  colonies,  pursuant  to  a  decision  of  the</span><span>  late  Intercolonial  Conference.  There</span><span>  has  also  been  unnecessary  detention  al</span><span>  the  several  ports  of  call,  bul  this  will,  no</span><span>  doubl,  soon  be  obviated.  As  the  com-</span><span>  manders  of  the  steamers  become  more</span></p> <p><span>  familiar  with  our  coasts  and  harbours,</span><span>  they  will  become  more  independent  of</span><span>  our  ineliicient  pilot  service.  And  we</span><span>  are  told  thal  arrangements  are  already</span><span>  contemplated  for  changing  the  ports  of</span><span>  call.  When  the  telegraph  wire  is  ex-</span></p> <p><span>  tended  lo  the  Kndeavour  River-which</span><span>  it  must  bc  within  a  few  months-Cook-</span><span>  town  will  be  substituted  for  Cardwell.</span></p> <p><span>  Already  the  agents  are  reported  to  have</span><span>  recommended  the  substitution  of  Cleve-</span><span>  land  Hay  for  Port  Denison,  and  Keppel</span><span>  Hay  for  Port  Curtis.  The  reasons</span><span>  assigned  are,  that  although  the  existing</span><span>  ports  of  call  boast  ofmagnilicent  harbours,</span><span>  the  approaches  to  them  are  intricate,</span><span>  and  can  hardly  be  deemed  safe  at  night</span><span>  for  vessels  drawing  nineteen  or  twenty</span><span>  feet  of  water.  To  ensure  expedition  it</span><span>  i  is  essential  that  the  calling  places  he</span></p> <p><span>  easily  approachable  al  any  hour,  and</span><span>  this  desideratum,  il  is  alleged,  is  found</span><span>  at  Magnetic  Island  in  Cleveland  Hay,</span><span>  and  Sea  Hill  in  Keppel  Hay.  Besides,</span><span>  it  is  staled  thal  fully  two  hours  will  be</span><span>  economised  at  each  of  these  ports</span><span>  through  the  reduction  of  distance,  and</span><span>  we  need  hardly  remark  thal  a  saving  of</span><span>  even  four  hours,  ¡san  important  object  in</span><span>  a  mail  service.  We  understand  also</span><span>  that  a  further  modification  has  been</span><span>  suggested  by  the  Company,  it  is  that</span><span>  instead  of  the  mail  steamers  calling  at</span><span>  Port  Denison  or  Cleveland  Hay,  thc</span><span>  contractors  should  pul  ona  small  but  swift</span><span>  despatch  boat  to  convey  the  mails</span><span>  between  Keppel  Hay  and  Cardwell.  The</span><span>  suggestion  appears  lo  be  a  good  one,  and</span><span>  is  also  worthy  of  attention  as  likely</span></p> <p><span>  to  afford  increased  facilities  for  the  con-</span><span>  veyance  ol  our  ordinary  mails  coast-</span></p> <p><span>  wise.</span></p> <p><span>  With  thc  necessary  lighthouses  supplied</span><span>  in  the  Strait,  and  the  proposed  modifica-</span><span>  tion  in  the  ports  of  call,  il  would  there-</span><span>  fore  be  possible  to  deliver  the  mails,</span><span>  with  a  nine-knot  speed,  in  fifty-three</span><span>  days  at  Brisbane,  and  in  fifty  one  days  at</span><span>  Keppel  Hay.  Hut  this  to  the  southern</span><span>  parts  of  the  colony  would  be  bul  a</span><span>  trilling  advantage,  and  the  route  would</span><span>  attract  no  Kuropean  letters  from  the</span><span>  southern  colonies,  ll  is  true  that  the</span><span>  northern  pulls  would  be  belier  served</span><span>  (han  formerly,  bul  on  the  whole</span><span>  the  advantages  conferred  by  service</span><span>  would  bc  comparatively  small.  Our</span></p> <p><span>  object,  then,  should  be  so  to  shorten</span><span>  thc  contract  time  as  not  only  lo  make</span><span>  thc  service  valuable  to  Queensland,</span><span>  bul  also  to  thc  southern  colonies.</span><span>  In  fact,  to  so  increase  the1  speed</span><span>  of  (lie  mail  boats,  as  to  make  the</span><span>  service  allómate  either  with  that  viâ</span><span>  California,  or  that  by  way  of  Melbourne</span></p> <p><span>  and  (¡alic.</span></p> <p><span>  The  correspondence  shows  that  thc</span><span>  contractors  for  the  Torres  Strait  line  are</span><span>  fully  prepared  to  increase  their  speed  if</span><span>  required.  They  have  already  offered,  in</span><span>  consideration  of  an  additional  ten  thou-</span><span>  sand  pounds  a-year-making  a  lotal</span><span>  subsidy  of  thirty  thousand-to  run  their</span><span>  boats  at  a  speed  of  ten  knots,  and  to</span><span>  deliver  thc  mails  at  Brisbane  within</span></p> <p><span>  forty-eight  days.  And  they  are  further</span><span>  prepared,  for  a  corresponding  increase,</span><span>  to  adopt  a  twelve-knot  speed,  and  land</span><span>  their  mails  in  forty-two  days  !  Their</span><span>  «cw  vessels  now  building  ave  of  thc  best</span><span>  and  most  modern  construction,  and  thc</span></p> <p><span>  company  arc  prepared  to  fit  them  with</span></p> <p><span>  such  boiler  power  as  will  ensure  an  j</span><span>  average  speed  in  all  weathers  of  al  least</span><span>  twelve  knots.  Were  this  arranged  for,</span><span>  (be  Torres  Strait  line  would  compete</span><span>  effectively  with  any  other,  and  our</span><span>  (¡overmnent  might  reckon  upon  toking</span><span>  toll  at  thc  rate  of  nineteen  pence  per</span><span>  ounce  upon  one-half  the  total  European</span><span>  correspondence  of  Australia.  The</span><span>  postal  revenue  thus  yielded  would</span><span>  materially  reduce  the  burden  of  the</span><span>  subsidy,  and  if  ratable  contributions  were</span></p> <p><span>  forthcoming  from  the  southern  colonies,  !</span><span>  Queensland  would  enjoy  tile  advantage</span><span>  of  a  first-class  mail  service  without  any</span><span>  addition  to  the  expense  already  incurred.</span></p> <p><span>  Thc  question  then  arises-Can  this</span><span>  very  desirable  object  be  attained  ?  First,</span><span>  as  to  the  amount  of  subsidy.  There</span><span>  appears  to  be  yet  hope  of  extracting  a</span><span>  contribution  of  ten  thousand  a-year  from</span><span>  New  South  Wales,  on  condition  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  speed  being  increased  to  ten  knots.  A  ,</span><span>  half-promise  was  some  time  since  given</span><span>  by  the  PARKES  Government  to  this</span><span>  effect,  and  in  consideration  of  Sydney</span><span>  being  made  the  postal  as  well  as  the</span><span>  commercial  terminus  of  thc  line,  it  is</span><span>  highly  probable  that  thc  contribution</span><span>  will  yet  be  forthcoming.  Hut  if  so,  a</span><span>  still,  larger  amount  might  be  expected</span><span>  for  a  twelve-knot  service,  especially</span></p> <p><span>  now  that  New  Zealand  has  taken</span></p> <p><span>  a  moiety  of  the  burden  of  the  Californian</span></p> <p><span>  contract.  New  South  Wales  would</span></p> <p><span>  certainly  appreciate  the  advantage  of  j</span><span>  an  alternating  fortnightly  service,  which  !</span><span>  would  render  her  independent  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  P.  and  O.  Co.'s  linc,  and  interpose  a  j</span><span>  check  to  the  immoderate  pretensions  of  j</span></p> <p><span>  Victoria.  ""</span></p> <p><span>  The  increase  of  speed  from  len  lo  j</span><span>  twelve  knots  would  involve  an  enor-  I</span><span>  mons  additional  expense  in  the  conduct</span></p> <p><span>  of  thc  service.  To  the  uninitiated  an  j</span><span>  extra  knot  or  two  an  hour  may  seem  but</span><span>  a  small  maller,  but  marine  engineers  and</span><span>  owners  of  steamboats  know  that  in  coals</span><span>  and  wear-and-lear  of  machinery  the</span><span>  expense  of  high  speeds  multiplies  rather</span><span>  than  increases  in  geometrical  ratio.  It</span><span>  is  probable  that  the  contractors  would</span></p> <p><span>  undertake  a  twelve-knot  service  for  a</span></p> <p><span>  subsidy  of  sixty  thousand  pounds  per</span><span>  annum,  but  for  a  less  amount  they</span><span>  certainly  would  not  venture  upon  it.</span><span>  Indeed,  it  is  understood  that  even  sixty</span><span>  thousand  pounds  would  not  be  an</span><span>  inducement  but  for  the  belief  that  a</span><span>  first-class  mail  service  via  Torres  Strait</span></p> <p><span>  would  attract  the  bulk  of  passenger</span></p> <p><span>  traffic  to  that  route.  What  then  would</span></p> <p><span>  be  the  probable  cost  to  this  colony  of</span><span>  such  a  service  ?  At  present  we  are</span><span>  paying  twenty  thousand  pounds  a-year.</span></p> <p><span>  If  we  could  induce  New  South  Wales  to</span></p> <p><span>  offer  a  yearly  contribution  of  an  equal</span><span>  amount,  and  New  Zealand  to  provide</span><span>  (say)  one-fourth  of  thal  sum,  the</span><span>  Queensland  contribution  to  the  subsidy</span><span>  would  be  increased  by  fifteen  thousand</span><span>  a  year-or  raised  to  thirly-five  thousand</span><span>  pounds.  Hui  as  a  set-off  against  this</span><span>  increase  lhere  would  be  the  tolls  collec-</span><span>  ted  on  all  southern  letters  sent  viá</span><span>  Queensland,  and  an  additional  toll  on</span><span>  telegrams  despatched  to  catch  the  mail</span><span>  boat  at  our  northernmost  port  of  call.</span><span>  These  collections  would  very  nearly,  if</span><span>  not  quite,  cover  thc  increased  cost  of  the</span><span>  service.  If  this  be  so,  North  Queens-</span><span>  land  might  be  brought  considerably</span></p> <p><span>  within  six  weeks'  reach  of  London</span></p> <p><span>  without  any  additional  charge  upon  the</span><span>  public  revenue.</span></p> <p><span>  These  facts  appear  to  present  an  excel-</span><span>  lent  opening  for  diplomatic  négociation,</span><span>  and  Mr.  THORN  bas  now  a  grand  oppor-</span><span>  tunity  of  immortalising  himself.

It  arose  out  of  a  trial  on  the</span><span>  2nd  December,  1871,  in  the  Criminal</span></p> <p><span>  Court  at  brisbane,  in  which  John  WI-1</span></p> <p><span>  liam  COA  TH,  master  of  theschoonerjason,</span></p> <p><span>  was  found  guilty  of  kidnapping,  before  j</span><span>  His  Honor  Mr.  Justice  LUI  WVCHK,  and  ,</span><span>  sentenced  to  imprisonment  for  five  years,</span><span>  and  to  pay  a  tine  of  fifty  pounds.  COATH</span><span>  was  primarily  committed  for  trial  on  the</span><span>  information  of  Mr.  JOHN  MEIKLEJOHN,</span><span>  who  accompanied  the  Jason  as  Govern-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  agent  when  the  alleged  kidnap-  ;</span><span>  ping  was  committed.  lt  transpired,</span><span>  I  however,  that  MEIKLEJOHN'S  oral  testi-</span><span>  mony  was  contradicted  by  Iiis  own</span><span>  entries  in  his  diary,  and  that  in  other</span><span>  respects  his  statements  induced  the</span><span>  belief  that  his  mind  was  affected.  His</span><span>  case  against  COATH  therefore  broke  down,</span><span>  .  and  the  doubt  which  his  testimony  ex-</span></p> <p><span>  cited  was  afterwards  justified  by  marked</span><span>  proofs  of  his  insanity.  He  subsequently</span><span>  destroyed  lu's  own  house  by  fire,  and  lias</span><span>  since  been  an  inmate  of  the  Talban</span></p> <p><span>  Creek  lunatic  asylum  in  New  South</span><span>  Wales.  According  to  the  statement  of</span><span>  Dr.  MANNING,  the  Superintendent  of</span><span>  that  asylum,  MEIKLEJOHN  has  ""an</span><span>  ""  attack  of  violent  and  dangerous  mania</span><span>  ""  about  once  in  three  months,  an&lt;i  in</span><span>  ""  the  intervals  he  is  calm,  plausible,  rea</span><span>  ""  soiling,  and  displays  considerable</span><span>  ""  powers  of  memory  and  intellect  ;  bm  is</span><span>  ""  cunningly  suspicious,  and  prone  to</span><span>  ""  make  the  most  malignant  accusations</span><span>  ""  against  everyone  about  him  with  an  air</span><span>  ""  of  thc  utmost  truthfulness.""  As  already</span><span>  stated,  il  was  on  the  evidence  of  this</span><span>  unfortunate  gentleman  thal  COATH  was</span><span>  first  committed  for  trial.  Another  in-</span><span>  formation,  similar  in  character,  was  after-</span><span>  wards  laid  against  him  by  JAMES  HAR-</span><span>  PUR,  one  of  the  seamen,  and  it  was  011</span><span>  his  evidence,  with  that  of  two  oilier</span><span>  sailors,  that  the  conviction  look  place.</span><span>  At  the  lime  of  the  trial  many  persons</span><span>  were  of  opinion  thal  the  story  was  a  con-</span><span>  coction,  and  thal  impression  was</span><span>  strengthened  by  the  well  known  profli-</span><span>  gate  character,  of  the  witness-in-chief  for</span><span>  die  prosecution.  So  strong  was  our  con-</span><span>  viction  on  this  matter  two  years  ago,</span><span>  that  we  expressed  in  these  columns  the</span><span>  belief  that  thc  man  had  been  wrongly</span></p> <p><span>  condemned.  Our  information  cune  from</span></p> <p><span>  anvissionary  source,  where,  hailtheve  been</span><span>  valid  grounds  for  the  conviction,  no</span><span>  sympathy  whatever  would  have  been</span></p> <p><span>  shown  with  the  criminal.  Native  testi-</span></p> <p><span>  mony  on  the  islands  was  the  basis  of</span><span>  belief  in  COATH'S  innocence,  but  that</span><span>  testimony  was  unfortunately  not  avail-</span><span>  able  in  his  defence.  Circumstances,</span><span>  however,  afterwards  occurred  which</span><span>  stimulated  inquiry,  and  caused  the  release</span><span>  of  the  prisoner  as  a  man  who  had  been</span><span>  wrongly  convicted  and  unjustly  incar-</span></p> <p><span>  cerated.</span></p> <p><span>  Immediately  after  the  trial,  390  in-</span><span>  habitants  of  .Maryborough  petitioned  for</span><span>  the  prisoner's  release,  on  the  ground  that</span><span>  native  testimony  in  that  district  and  at</span><span>  the  islands  unanimously  pointed  to  his</span><span>  innocence  of  the  crime.  Inconsequence,</span><span>  Mr.  A.  W.  MANNINI;  was  sent  up  to</span><span>  Maryborough  to  make  inquiries.  He</span><span>  visited  unexpectedly  the  several  planta-</span><span>  tions  on  which  Polynesians  were  em-</span><span>  ployed,  and  among  others  examined</span><span>  ""  seven  Malicolo  and  two  'lanna</span><span>  ""  islanders,  whose  assumed  abduction</span><span>  ""occasioned  the  prosecution  of  Captain</span><span>  ""  COATH,  and  his  consequent  punish</span><span>  ""  melli.""  Their  unvarying  replies  were,</span><span>  ""  Me  want  to  come  ;""  ""  Captain</span><span>  COATH  very  good.""  Thc  ATIORNKY</span><span>  GENERAL,  however,  in  commenting  upon</span><span>  Mr.  MANNING'S  report,  pointed  out  that</span><span>  these  seven  Malicolo  and  two  Tanna  men</span></p> <p><span>  were  not  those  for  the  stealing  of  whom</span><span>  COATH  was  convicted.  The  real  victims  !</span><span>  were  nine  Api  or  Tanna  men,  and  he</span><span>  (Mr.  HRAMSTON)  was  not  satisfied  thal</span><span>  Mr.  MANNINI  :  had  seen  them  amongst</span><span>  I  the  men  examined.  He  therefore</span></p> <p><span>  thought  the  prisoner  could  not  bc  safely</span><span>  released  upon  these  statements,  but</span><span>  suggested  further  inquiry.  The  next</span><span>  step  was  the  forwarding  of  a  petition  by</span><span>  COATH  to  the  GOVERNOR,  thc  allegation's</span><span>  in  which  were  supported  by  solemn</span><span>  declarations  made  hy  several  of  the</span><span>  ""kidnapped""  Polynesians,  and  by  the</span><span>  chief  officer  and  one  seaman  who  were</span><span>  on  board  the  Jason  when  the  alleged</span><span>  outrage  tool;  place.  All  these  documents</span><span>  tended  to  establish  the  innocence  of  the</span><span>  prisoner.</span></p> <p><span>  After  perusing  the  petition,  the</span><span>  ATTORNEV-GENEIIAL  resolved  personally</span><span>  lo  question  the  Polynesians  alleged  to</span><span>  have  been  kidnapped,  and  he  accordingly</span><span>  proceeded  to  .  .Maryborough  fur  thal</span><span>  purpose.  He  examined  nine  islanders,</span><span>  arid  their  testimony  was  all  corroborative</span><span>  of  that  previously  obtained  by  Afr.</span><span>  MANNINI;.  In  subsequently  reporting</span><span>  the  proceedings  lo  the  GOVERNOR,  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  IJRAMSTIIN  wrote  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""The  islauders  were  not  examine.!  at</span><span>  either  of  the  previous  inquiries  as  to  the  agree-</span><span>  ment  raailc  over-night,  or  as  to  the  disposal  of</span><span>  the  pigs  ami  finit,  so  that  they  could  not</span><span>  anticipate  my  questions,  and  they  had  no</span><span>  opportunity  of  concerting  the  story  after  1</span></p> <p><span>  bogan  tbo  examination.

I,  therefore,</span><span>  beg  to  recommend  him  for  a  pardon  in  Her</span><span>  Majesty's  name,""</span></p> <p><span>  Tlie  above  particulars  have  been</span><span>  chiefly  gleaned  from  a  paper  laid  before</span><span>  Parliament  last  month.  Strangely  enough,</span><span>  it  contains  no  intimation  of  the  steps</span><span>  subsequently  taken  beyond  the  bare  in-</span><span>  timation  by  Mr.  BRAMSTON  thal  a  free</span><span>  pardon  had  been  granted  upon  his  re-</span></p> <p><span>  commendation.  The  matter  does  not</span><span>  appear  to  have  been  submitted  to  the</span><span>  Executive  Council  at  all,  and  the  pri-</span><span>  soner,  it  may  be  presumed,  was  released</span><span>  ¡  by  a  simple-exercise  of  the  royal  preroga-</span></p> <p><span>  tive.  Tl)  is  method  of  procedure  wnsatleast</span><span>  peculiar,  the  custom  in  such  cases  being</span><span>  to  refer  the  new  evidence  to  the  Judge</span><span>  who  tried  the  case.  Possibly  that)was</span><span>  done,  lint  it  would  have  been  more  satis-</span><span>  factory  had  die  paper  laid  before  Parlia-</span><span>  ment  contained  some  information  upon</span><span>  thal  point.  It  does  bear  the  look  of  a</span><span>  stretch  of  thc  prerogative  lo  reverse  the</span><span>  verdict  of  a  jury  without  the  Judge's</span><span>  recommendation,  and  we  can  but  hope</span><span>  such  recommendation  was  first  obtained.</span></p> <p><span>  .There  cnn  be  no  reasonable  doubt  of</span></p> <p><span>  th  ;  prisoner's  innocence,  but  there  is  a</span><span>  natural  apprehension  in  the  public  mind</span><span>  lest  an  injurious  precedent  should  have</span><span>  been  set  by  the  procedure  in  this</span></p> <p><span>  matter.</span></p> <p><span>  This  case  is  also  calculated  to  awaken</span><span>  anxiety  on  other  grounds.  If,  willi  our</span><span>  cumbersome  system  of  trial  by  jury,</span><span>  it  is  possible  for  an  innocent  man  to</span><span>  be  convicted  of  felony,  to  be  de-</span><span>  prived  of  his  good  name  and  fame,</span><span>  and  to  be  kept  in  prison  for  two  whole</span><span>  years,  where  are  the  boasted  safeguards</span><span>  which  arc  supposed  to  protect  the</span><span>  mdt  vidual  in  British  communities?  It</span></p> <p><span>  floes  appear  odd  that  not  one  of  the</span><span>  islanders  alleged  to  have  been  kidnapped</span></p> <p><span>  was  examined  at  the  trial,  and  that  the  in-  !</span><span>  criminatory  evidence  of  sailors,  who  had</span><span>  quarrelled  with  the  prisoner,  should  have</span><span>  been  accepted  without  qualification  hy</span><span>  the  corni.  It  seems  hard  to  get  rid  of</span><span>  the  suspicion  that  the  anti-slavery  mania</span><span>  then  prevalent  al  Brisbane  gave  an</span><span>  unconscious  bias  to  the  decision  of  the</span><span>  jury.  The  undeserved  punishment  was</span><span>  an  outrage  upon  Captain  COATH,  and</span></p> <p><span>  his  case  cannot  fail  to  secure  the</span></p> <p><span>  sympathy  of  all  impartial  persons.  But</span><span>  still  greater  mischief  resulted  from  thc</span><span>  conviction.  It  gave  consistency  to  the</span><span>  imputations  of  those  over-zealous  phil-</span><span>  anthropists  who  charged  the  colonists  of</span><span>  Queensland  with  being  the  aiders  and</span></p> <p><span>  abettors  of  men-slealers.  It  is  some</span><span>  consolation  to  find,  even  at  this  late</span><span>  period,  that  the  reproach  has  at  length</span><span>  been  removed,  and  that  up  lo  the  present</span><span>  lime  there  is  no  valid  reason  to  believe</span><span>  that  employers  of  labour  in  this  colony</span><span>  h  u  e  ever  soiled  their  hands  by  trafficking</span><span>  in  the  bodies  and  souls  of  their  fellow^</span></p> <p><span>  men.  Bul  the  whole  circumstances  ol</span><span>  the  trial,  the  conviction,  and  the  release,</span><span>  do  not  supply  grounds  for  an  agreeable</span><span>  retrospect.</span></p> <p><span>  Oirii  Coloration  lias  been  making  praise-</span><span>  worthy  efforts  to  improve  tho  sanitary  con-</span><span>  dition  of  tho  town,  but  there  is  scope  for</span></p> <p><span>  further  administrative  reform  in  thc  same</span><span>  direction.

Naturally</span><span>  enough  he  was  very  angry,  hut  the  injury</span><span>  hciug  done  by  a  constable  he  had  no</span><span>  rodross  without  proving  malice,  a  rather</span><span>  difficult  matter.  Mr.  Willis,  however,  has</span><span>  again  got  into  trouble,  and  certiinly</span><span>  supplies  a  striking  illustration  of  what  may</span><span>  happen  to  a  man  iu  thc  bush,  lt  appears  that</span><span>  on  being  discharged  hera  last  November  he</span><span>  proceeded  to  Brisbane,  where  he  remained  a</span><span>  short  time,  and  then  went  overland  to  thc</span><span>  Barcoo  to  adjust  some  business  ho  left  in  an</span><span>  unsettled  state,  when  dragged  away  to  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  by  thc  Ipolice.  From  thc  Barcoo,  he</span><span>  started  for  Brisbane,  going  round  by</span><span>  way  of  Clermont,  determined  on  reach-</span><span>  ing  thc  metropolis  to  demand  au  iuvestigation</span><span>  into  tho  circumstances  attending  his  previous</span><span>  arrest.

Mr.  MURPHY,</span><span>  alluding  to  the  demand  from  the  north</span><span>  for  a  change  in  the  seat  of  government,</span><span>  proposed  to  meet  it  by  diffuse  public  ex-</span><span>  penditure  on  Brisbane,  and  by  pushing  on</span><span>  tile  construction  of  a  net-work  of  railways</span><span>  in  the  back  country  of  which  Brisbane  is</span><span>  the  port,  ""  so  that  Brisbane  would  lake</span><span>  ""  such  a  position  that  the  North  could</span><span>  ""  no  longer  cry  out  for  such  a  change.""</span></p> <p><span>  We  do  not  wonder  that  this  kind  of  ]</span><span>  statesmanship  was  too  audaciously</span><span>  corrupt  even  for  a  metropolitan  audi-</span><span>  ence.  Such  a  mode  of  procedure</span><span>  would  raise  up  a  compact  parliamentary</span><span>  phalanx  with  the  determined  object  of</span><span>  preventing  the  aggrandisement  of  Bris-</span><span>  bane,  in  which  case  Mr.  MURPHV  would</span><span>  liave  found  thc  last  state  of  the  city</span><span>  worse  than  the  first.  Oismissing  all</span></p> <p><span>  consideration  of  thc  claims  of</span></p> <p><span>  justice,  therefore,  the  proposition  was</span><span>  a  highly  imprudent  one,  and  Mr.</span><span>  MURPHV  richly  deserved  the  snubbing</span><span>  afterwards  given  him  at  thc  poll.  On  the</span><span>  education  question,  too,  this  candidate</span><span>  was  equivocal  in  his  utterances,  and</span><span>  evaded  the  question  whether  he  would</span><span>  continue  state  aid  to  non-vested  schools.</span><span>  This  alone,  lo  a  constituency  educated</span><span>  by  Mr.  LILLEY,  should  have  been  fatal</span><span>  to  the  candidate's  prospects,  and  possibly</span></p> <p><span>  was  the  real  cause  of  Mr.  MURPHY'S</span><span>  rejection.</span></p> <p><span>  With  regard  to  the  successful  candi-</span><span>  date,  it  is  satisfactory  to  find  that  his</span><span>  speecli  had  the  genuine  ring  of  true</span><span>  metal,  and  that  although  addressing  a</span><span>  metropolitan  audience  ho  had  thc  honesty</span><span>  and  manliness  to  say,  ""  He  believed</span><span>  ""  their  representatives  should  pay  most</span><span>  ""  particular  attention  to  the  improve</span><span>  ""  ment  of  the  harbours  and  rivers  along</span><span>  ""  the  whole  coast  of  Queensland,  and</span><span>  ""  for  his  part  he  said  at  once  thal  if</span><span>  ""  elected  he  did  not  mean  to  go  into  thc</span><span>  ""  House  for  the  purpose  of  making</span><span>  ""  Brisbane  the  greatest  of  ports,  but  to</span><span>  ""  do  justice  also  to  the  various  Northern</span><span>  ""  ports  -  Maryborough,  Rockhampton,</span><span>  ""  etc.""  Mr.  BEATTIE  adopts  thc  principles</span><span>  of  Mr.  LILLEY'S  education  bill,  but  takes</span><span>  exception  to  some  of  its  details.  In</span><span>  one  part  of  his  address  lie  gave  the  legal</span><span>  profession  a  hard  knock  by  observing</span><span>  that  hail  business  men  instead  of  lawyers</span><span>  had  thc  drafting  of  our  land  laws  there</span><span>  would  be  fewer  loop-holes  for  the  dimi-</span><span>  nuer.  This  probably  told  against  his</span><span>  opponent,  for  whether  founded  in  truth</span><span>  or  not,  there  can  be  no  doubt  of</span><span>  the  prevalence  of  the  belief  that  thc</span><span>  special  pleading  of  the  legal  members</span><span>  of  the  late  parliament  was  not</span><span>  conducive  to  beneficial  legislation.</span><span>  In  the  new  Assembly  there  are  but  four</span><span>  lawyers,  so  that  the  public  will  soon  have</span></p> <p><span>  an  opportunity  of  judging  whether  their  j</span><span>  lessened  influence  will  be  advantageous  ;</span><span>  or  not.  In  concluding,  Mr.  Beattie  had  !</span><span>  the  modesty  to  remark  that  ""  He  might,  ,</span><span>  ""if  elected,  make  failures;  but,  if  such</span><span>  ""  should  lie  the  case,  they  would  not</span><span>  ""  arise  from  any  want  of  will  on  his  part</span><span>  ""  that  fair  and  even  justice  should  be</span><span>  ""  done  to  this  constituency  as  well  as  lo</span><span>  ""  the  whole  colony.""

The  debate  was  conducted</span></p> <p><span>  with  good  temper  and  moderation  which</span><span>  does  the  Assembly  great  credit  ;  and  if</span><span>  sonic  members  indulged  in  long  and</span><span>  dreary  orations,  the  greatest  sinners  in</span><span>  this  respect  have  had  a  kindly  veil</span><span>  thromiovertheirindiscrctionsbythePress.</span><span>  The  best  speech  of  the  debate  was  de-</span><span>  livered,  in  our  opinion,  by  Mr.  GRAHAM,</span><span>  who  reviewed  the  land  laws  of  thc  colony</span><span>  from  its  foundation,  and  after  completely</span></p> <p><span>  emolishing  the  new  bill,  sketched  out</span><span>  .vhat,  in  the  opinion  of  the  speaker,</span></p> <p><span>  should  bc  the  character  of  the  future</span></p> <p><span>  legislation  on  this  subject.  Mr.  GRAHAM'S</span><span>  speech  on  the  occasion  was  marked  by  a</span><span>  liberality,  comprehensiveness,  and  inde-</span><span>  pendence  of  thought  which  did  both  him</span><span>  and  his  constituents  the  utmost  credit,</span><span>  and  completely  vanquished  several  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  rabid  Liberals  of  the  southern  districts.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  extremely  fortunate  for  the  inember</span><span>  for  Clermont  that  he  has  taken  advantage</span><span>  of  this  opportunity,  as  heretofore  the</span><span>  impression  has  been  that  he  had  left  office</span><span>  without  making  his  mark.  That,  however,</span><span>  ¡snow  shown  to  be  a  mistaken  conception,</span><span>  and  he  is  complimented  equally  by</span><span>  friends  and  opponents.  No  one  now</span><span>  doubts  that  in  acquiring  valuable  infor-</span><span>  mation,  and  mastering  the  land  question,</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  GRAHAM  has  turned  his  brief  and</span></p> <p><span>  eventless  term  of  office  to  good  account  ;  j</span><span>  and  the  conviction  seems  to  have  become  j</span><span>  general  that,  so  far  as  the  personw  I  of</span><span>  the  Lands  Department  is  concerned,  the</span><span>  colony  is  not  benefitted  by  thc  change</span><span>  of  Ministry.  Whether  the  almost  entire</span><span>  elimination  of  squatting  influence  from</span><span>  the  Cabinet  will  prove  advantageous  is</span><span>  of  course  quite  another  matter.</span></p> <p><span>  In  moving  the  second  reading  of  his</span><span>  bill,  Mr.  STEPHENS  make  a  very  long,</span><span>  and  from  an  exclusively  southern  stand-</span><span>  point,  perhaps  an  able  speech.  It  was</span><span>  moderate  in  tone,  and  very  fairly</span><span>  attempted  to  grapple  with  the  scandals</span><span>  alleged  to  exist  in  the  southern  districts.</span><span>  But  it  exhibited  a  poor  compréhension</span><span>  of  the  real  wants  of  the  colony,  and</span><span>  provoked  an  amount  of  hostile  though</span><span>  moderate  criticism  which  must  have</span><span>  taught  the  new  MINISTER  FOR  LANDS  a</span><span>  useful  lesson.  Mr.  PALMER'S  attack</span></p> <p><span>  consisted  chiefly  of  ridicule,  and,  in  its</span><span>  way,  was  very  effectual.  Mr.  THOMPSON</span><span>  made  a  successful  defence  of  his  ad-</span></p> <p><span>  ministration,  and  pointed  out  that  the</span><span>  chief  of  thc  dummying  scandals  occurred</span><span>  under  the  administration  of  his  prede-</span><span>  cessors,  and  under  the  Leasing  Act  of</span></p> <p><span>  iBúú.  This  was  one  of  the  most  valid</span><span>  arguments  used  against  die  new  bill,  and</span><span>  considerably  dismayed  those  blatant</span><span>  Toowoomba  men  who  colloquially  are</span><span>  the  victims  of  ""  dummy  on  thc  brain.""</span><span>  Mr.  THOMPSON  had  a  great  advantage</span><span>  over  other  members  in  having  been  for</span><span>  several  years  .it  the  head  of  the  Lands</span><span>  Department,  and  in  exhibiting  a  prac-</span><span>  tical  acquaintance  with  the  question  to</span><span>  which  no  one-Mv.  GRAHAM  excepted</span><span>  -could  make  any  pretension.  In  a  de-</span><span>  bate  on  thc  land  question  it  is  evidently</span><span>  no  mean  advantage  to  be  an  ex-Minister</span><span>  for  Lands.  Bul,  perhaps,  after  Mr.</span><span>  GRAHAM'S,  the  most  effective  speech  of</span><span>  the  debate  was  th.it  delivered  by  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Gun  i  ini,  who.  although  a  staunch'parly  .</span><span>  man  on  the  Ministerial  side,  sealed  the</span><span>  condemnation  of  the  bill.  He  saw  many</span></p> <p><span>  defects  in  it,  and  only  one  good  principle,</span><span>  namely,  the  proposed  resumption  of  the</span><span>  leased  halves  of  all  rims  in  the  settled</span><span>  districts.  He  twitted  the  Ministry,  and</span><span>  also  their  predecessors,  with  want  of  the</span><span>  moral  courage  necessary  lo  the  adminis-</span><span>  tration  of  the  present  law,  and  pointed</span><span>  out  that  it  was  (mite  equal  to  the</span><span>  suppression  of  dummyism.  He  also  con</span><span>  tended  that  it  was  the  duty  of</span><span>  the  Government  to  clear  the  -colony</span><span>  of  this  scandal  without  creating</span><span>  any  new-fangled  tribunal,  and  he  con-</span><span>  cluded  by  warmly  deprecating  unneces-</span><span>  sary  alterations  in  the  land  laws  of  the</span><span>  colony.  Taken  altogether,  Mr.  GRIF-</span><span>  FITH'S  was  a  most  merciless  onslaught</span><span>  on  the  Ministerial  land  policy.</span></p> <p><span>  Thc  members  for  the  Central  Districts</span><span>  were  unanimous  in  their  condemnation</span><span>  of  the  bill.  Mr.  MACDONALD  started</span></p> <p><span>  carly  in  the  debate  with  the  declaration</span><span>  that,  as  it  stood,  the  bill  was  only  suited</span><span>  to  a  portion  of  the  southern  districts,  and</span><span>  that  unless  it  was  greatly  altered  in  com-</span><span>  mittee  he  must  vote  against  it.  Mr.</span><span>  BUZACOTT  -  asked  for  proof  that  the</span><span>  alleged  scandals  had  occurred  in  the  ad-</span><span>  ministration  of  the  Act  of  1868  tn  the</span><span>  Central  and  Northern  Districts.</span></p> <p><span>  He  generally  condemned  the  prin-</span><span>  ciples  of  the  bill,  and  protested</span><span>  against  their  being  forced  upon</span><span>  thc  people  of  the  Central  Districts.  Mr.</span><span>  JOHN  SCOTT  maintained  that  the  Act  of</span><span>  1868  was  equal  lo  the  wants  of  the</span><span>  colony,  that  the  residence  clause  was  an</span><span>  infringement  upon  the  liberty  of  the</span><span>  subject,  and  that  the  wholesale  resump-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  of  leases  was  a  breach  of</span><span>  faith.  Mr.  DK  S.VTOE  objected  to  the</span><span>  bill  from  a  purely  squatters'  point</span><span>  of  view,  and,  although  there  was</span><span>  much  truth  in  his  observations,  their</span><span>  judiciousness  at  the  present  time  is</span><span>  rather  questionable.  On  the  whole,</span><span>  however,  the  people  of  the  Central</span></p> <p><span>  Districts  luve  niucii  cause  tor  satisiac</span></p> <p><span>  tiou  that  their  representatives,  entirely</span><span>  without  party  action,  and  from  different</span><span>  stand-points,  united  in  condemning  a</span><span>  measure  which,  whatever  its  merits  as  a</span><span>  scheme  for  dealing  with  Crown  Lands</span><span>  on  thc  Darling  Downs,  would  inaugurate</span><span>  a  retrograde  and  injurious  policy  if</span><span>  applied  to  this  part  of  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  it  is  quite  problematical  whether  the</span><span>  bill  will  go  through  Committee  or  not.</span><span>  Mr.  MACALISTER  has  announced  that</span><span>  the  Government  are  not  wedded  to  any</span><span>  of  its  principles  beyond  that  of  resuming</span><span>  the  leases,  and  therefore  the  probability</span><span>  is  that  the  measure  will  pass  through  the</span><span>  Assembly.  But  if  so,  it  will  come  out  in</span><span>  a  greatly  altered  shape,  in  which  case  its</span><span>  rejection  by  the  Upper  House  is  certain.</span><span>  This  will  not  be  a  matter  for  regret</span><span>  under  the  circumstances,  for  the  balance</span><span>  of  opinion,  even  in  the  Assembly,</span><span>  appears  to  be  that  the  new  bill  has  not</span><span>  been  demanded  by  the  colony.</span></p> ",Article,1874-06-06,"The Rockhampton Bulletin WITH WHICH IS INCONPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER.

It  is  essential  to</span><span>  constitutional  government  that  the</span><span>  .seals  of  office  should  not  remain  unin-</span><span>  terruptedly  in  the  hands  of  ono  party  ;</span><span>  and  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the</span><span>  liberals,  both  In  tho  Commons  and  tho</span><span>  constituencies,  ts  not  potent  enough  to</span><span>  prevent  tho  Conservatives  from  securing</span><span>  sn  occasional  term  of  power.  Indeed,</span><span>  it  has  not  unfrequently  been  found  that</span><span>  a  protracted  tonuru  of  successful  rule</span><span>  will  of  itself  eventually  bring  about  the</span><span>  disintegration  of  aMinistry.

Ono</span><span>  evening  in  the  middle  of  the  month  of</span><span>  December  last,  thc  boats  (two)  had  arrived</span><span>  at  the  island  as  usual,  one  of  them</span><span>  containing  a  quantity  of  provisions,  in  addi-</span><span>  tion  to  the  convicts  and  a  portion  of  tho</span><span>  guard.  The  former,  who  it  is  to  bc  prosumod</span><span>  ""  left  their  country  for  their  country's  good,""</span><span>  then  stepped  ou  shore  with  their  escort,  thc</span><span>  ollicer  in  cliwge  ordering  two  of  the  convicts</span><span>  to  romain  in  thc  boat  and  take  nor  to  another</span><span>  binding  close  by  for  tho  purposo  of  landing  thc</span><span>  provisions  mid  water  with  greater  case  and</span><span>  safety.  Ono  of  these  men  was  an  old  sea  cap</span><span>  taiu.

As  soon  as  it  was  comprehended  on</span><span>  «höre  that  they  were  escaping,  thoru  was  a</span><span>  great  commotion,  ami  tho  other  large  boat  was</span><span>  speedily  manned  by  thc  guards,  who  could  do</span><span>  very  little  in  thc  way  of  pursuit,  as  most  of  thc</span><span>  sails,  oars,  and  gear,  had  been  placed  in  the</span><span>  other  anil  now  rapidly  departing  boat,  and</span><span>  thc  few  oars  and  an  old  Bail  that</span><span>  hail  been  loft  behind  had  disappeared  by  some</span><span>  means  between  thc  time  thc  boats  had  lauded</span><span>  their  living  freight  and  the  time  the  one  was</span><span>  wanted  to  start  in  pursuit.

Bot  something  must  be</span><span>  done,  mid  that  soon,  or  tho  trado  of</span><span>  Rockhampton  will  suffer  great  and  last-</span><span>  ing  injury.  As  tho  coasting  trade</span><span>  increases  northward,  it  becomes  moro</span><span>  and  moro  a  matter  of  importance  to  this</span><span>  port  that  passing  steamers  should  be</span><span>  able  to  call  without  thc  danger  of  stick</span><span>  ing  on  tho  Flats  and  loeing  a  tide.</span><span>  Rockhampton  has  also  a  direct  trade</span><span>  with  Europe,  struggling  lo  establish</span><span>  itself  on  a  permanent  footing;  but  the</span><span>  charges  in  the  form  of  lighterage,  towage,</span><span>  and  other  cxpeuses  arising  from  the</span><span>  neglected  state  of  the  river,  nud  the</span><span>  absence  of  ordinary  facilities  for  shipping,</span><span>  fall  with  almost  crushing  weight  on  our</span><span>  infantile  trade,  and  if  nothing  is  done  to</span><span>  remove  some  of  the  existing  drawbacks,</span><span>  the  port  will  get  a  bad  name,  which  is</span><span>  far  easier  ncquirod  than  got  rid  of.</span></p> <p><span>  To  provide  tho  requisite  facilities  for</span><span>  shipping,  a  project  has  been  mooted</span><span>  to  construct  a  tramway  from  Rockhatnp</span><span>  ton  to  a  point  in  tho  river  frontago  at</span><span>  tho  Town  Common,  where,  it  is  alleged,</span><span>  vessels  of  eighteen  feet  draught</span><span>  could  come  up  in  ordinary  spring</span><span>  ti  dos,  and  experience  no  difficulty  in  the</span><span>  river  navigation.  The  length  of  tramway</span><span>  would  be  about  fifteen  miles,  and  it  is</span></p> <p><span>  urged  that  the  Corporation  should</span><span>  take  the  scheme  in  hand,  and</span><span>  they  would  not  only  benefit  th?</span><span>  town,  but  make  good  dividends  by  tb"",</span><span>  receipts  from  tho  tramway.  The  advo-</span><span>  cate!)  of  this  scheme  mustbesanguino  ina</span><span>  to  suppose  that  it  would  oitbor  provo  «</span><span>  financial  success  or  benefit  trado,  Wo</span><span>  do  not  look  coldly  on  tho  proposal  from</span><span>  any  fear  that  it  would  bring  into</span></p> <p><span>  existence  a  rival  town,  for  that  is  quito  |</span><span>  nut  of  tim  question.  But  wo  bold  the</span><span>  opinion  that  for  many  years  to  come  the</span><span>  principal  part  of  tho  trade  will  bc  carrie  I</span><span>  on  by  coasters,  in  Ilia  same  way</span></p> <p><span>  as  at  thc  present  time  ;  and  I</span><span>  vessels  of  Ibis  class  would  never  j</span><span>  uso  the  deep  water  wharfage  or  the</span></p> <p><span>  tramway.  They  would  prefer  coining  np  |</span><span>  to  Rockhampton,  in  spito  of  tho  risk  of</span><span>  grounding  on  the  Vint*.  Tho  most</span><span>  reasonable  thing,  therefore,  is  to  reider</span><span>  judicious  aid  to  the  trade  as  it  actually</span><span>  exists,  and  not  to  launch  out  tn  theo</span><span>  rctical  projects,  afterwards  to  find  that</span><span>  wo  ha>l  hoon  taking  a  leap  in  the  d'irk.</span><span>  Wo  would  apply  to  trade  a  principio</span><span>  that  has  boen  found  to  hold  good  in</span><span>  improving  rivera-attempt  no  violent</span><span>  changos,  but  aim  lo  improve  the  natural</span><span>  channels.  And  in  tho  matter  under</span><span>  consideration,  this  principle  commends</span><span>  itself  ns  won  by  of  adoption.  Th.i</span><span>  river  navigation  must,  in  any  caso,  bj</span><span>  improved  ns  far  u;i  a*  Rockhampton,</span><span>  and  wo  believe  the  most  elfie!  u&lt;i!  and</span></p> <p><span>  cheapest  plan  of  providing  tho  requisite  j</span><span>  facilities  for  tho  trado  of  tho  pori  is  to  '</span><span>  deepen  the  river  channel  as  funds  un-</span><span>  procurable,  with  tho  view  of  enabling</span><span>  such  vessels  as  tho  Alexandrina  to  lie</span></p> <p><span>  alongside  the  wharves  at  Rockhampton,</span><span>  without  lightering  in  tho  river.  This</span><span>  could  be  accomplished  at  a  moderate</span><span>  cost,  provided  tho  work  iver.!  undertaken</span><span>  in  a  systematic  and  sensible  manne-.</span><span>  Tho  first  thing  lo  be  dono  ia  to  gel</span><span>  a  thorough  survey  of  tho  river,</span></p> <p><span>  and  elaborate  an  effectivo  sc'iomc</span></p> <p><span>  for  deepening  thc  channel.  The,</span><span>  plans  and  specifications  having  bcjii</span><span>  prepared,  the  work  should  be  carried  out</span><span>  in  accordance  willi  them,  as  opportunity</span><span>  ottered.  This  method  would  tend  ti</span><span>  proinolo  economy,  and  bj  thc  most</span><span>  satisfactory  in  I  ho  long  run.  Until  the</span><span>  channel  at  the  Upper  Finis  was  Buffi</span><span>  cionty  deepened,  a  steam  lighter  plying</span><span>  in  thc  river  would  bo  as  serviceable  as  1</span></p> <p><span>  tlie  proposed  tramway,  and  would  bs</span><span>  more  profitable  to  ita  owners.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  useless,  however,  to  discuss  plans</span></p> <p><span>  unless  meaus  arc  taken  lo  reach  a</span><span>  practical  rnsult.  It  will  never  do  to</span><span>  quietly  leave  tho  milter  in  th«  hinds  of</span><span>  thc  Government,  fir  s'ldi  a  course</span><span>  involves  ruinous  delays  and  waste</span></p> <p><span>  of  moins.  A  Harbour  and  River  Trust</span><span>  is  what  is  wanted,  holli  lo  in  uko  im-</span><span>  provements  in  tho  navigation  and  to  look</span><span>  after  tho  general  management  of  tho</span><span>  port.

Perhaps  this</span><span>  fueling  is  carried  too  far,  for  il  is  quite  possible</span><span>  that  as  thc  interior  of  this  country  becomes</span><span>  known,  some  definite  and  reliable  information</span><span>  as  to  Leichhardts  fate  may  bc  obtained.  It</span><span>  appears  from  our  telegrams  published  yester-</span><span>  day  and  to  day,  that  a  mau  named  Jinnie  has</span><span>  arrived  in  liiishaue  hy  thc  steamer  boomerang</span><span>  -probably  having  taken  bis  passago  at  Towns</span><span>  villa  or  Bowen-who  assorts  that  he  has  found</span><span>  a  survivor  of  Leichhardts  party,  named</span><span>  Classait,  and  has  got  hold  of  Leichhardts</span><span>  diary,  consisting  of  sixty  pages.  He  states</span><span>  tint  the  mon  of  tho  expedition  mutinied,</span></p> <p><span>  wanting  to  return,  Leichhardt  insisting  mi</span><span>  prococding,  although  ill.  They  loft,  and</span><span>  Leichhardt  died  on  thc  fifth  day</span><span>  after,  (Hassan  was  away  at  tho  time</span><span>  of  tho  ministry,  in  search  of  -water.</span><span>  Thc  mutineers  took,  tho  horses,  hut  were  all</span><span>  subsequently  killed  at  Eyre's  Creek.  It</span><span>  seems  that  on  Thursday,  Hume  made  a  de-</span><span>  tailed  statement  of  thc  discovery  of  Classai!</span><span>  and  tho  fate  nf  Leichhardts  party.  Thc</span><span>  statement  was  apparently  truthful,  hut  much</span><span>  doubted  by  thc  general  public.  Hume,  our</span><span>  telegram  says,  was  unwilling  to  show  docu-</span><span>  ments,  pending  his  arrival  in  Sydney.  This</span><span>  was  considered  a  suspicious  circumstance,  and</span><span>  has  helped  to  throw  discredit  on  his  story.</span><span>  Thc  point  that  most  requires  explanation  in</span><span>  our  view,  however,  is,  what  has  become  of</span><span>  tho  survivor,  Classau,  There  is  nothing  re-</span><span>  markable  in  Hume's  reluctance  to  show  docu-</span><span>  ment*  he  may  have  in  his  possession,  but  ono</span><span>  would  havu  supposed  that  if  his  story  wore</span><span>  true,  the  living  cvideneo  in  thc  person</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  niau  (Hassan  would  have  been  forth-</span><span>  coming.  lt  seems,  however,  that  Mr.</span><span>  John  Uouglns  is  satisfied  willi  Hume's</span><span>  ioiiu  fiU's,  and  has  telegraphed  to  Mr.  Parkes</span><span>  to  that  effect  Thc  question  arises,  who  is</span><span>  this  linnie  ?  There  is,  we  are  informed,  a</span><span>  surveyor  of  that  name,  who  used  tn  bc  on  the</span><span>  Maranoa,  and  who  is  a  relative  of  Mr.  A.  C.</span><span>  (.rcgory,  tho  Surveyor-fJoncral..  lint  if  we</span><span>  remember  rightly,  this  is  the  name  of  thc</span><span>  convict  who,  sonic  eighteen  mouths  ago  or</span><span>  more,  whilst  in  prison  ill  New  South  Wales,</span></p> <p><span>  and  aFtcr  having  served  two  or  three  years  of</span><span>  his  sentence,  scut  a  written  statement  to  Mr,</span><span>  Parkes,  thc  Premier  of  thc  sister  colony,</span><span>  stating  that  he  believed  he  could  find  remains</span><span>  of  Leichhardts  party,  and,  in  all  probability,</span><span>  bis  diary  ;  and  that,  if  thc  (iovenuncnt  would</span><span>  grant  him  his  freedom,  he  weald  try  his  best</span><span>  to  do  so.  Thc  statement  seemed  plausible,</span><span>  and  a  special  commission  was  appointed  to</span><span>  examine  thc  prisoner  aud  test  his  truthful-</span><span>  ness.  Thc  Coiumissioii  used  every  device  to</span></p> <p><span>  ascertain  if  tho  mau  wera  attempting  an  j</span><span>  impution,  but  thc  most  searching  crosá</span><span>  cxauiinatinn  failed  to  shake  his  testimony,  but,</span></p> <p><span>  on  thc  contrary,  seemed  to  confirm  it.

In  view  of  these</span><span>  weighty  considerations,  wo  cannot  soc</span></p> <p><span>  how  tho  Homo  Government  can  hesitato</span></p> <p><span>  to  annex  thc  territory  in  quostion.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  a  difficulty  in  tho  way  nf  |</span><span>  tho  annexation  of  the  wholo  of  the  j</span><span>  principal  island  of  New  Guinea,  as  tho</span></p> <p><span>  Du'c'i  lay  claim  to  that  portion  lying  j</span><span>  westward  of  tho  Hist  parallel  of  j</span><span>  longitude.

It  is</span><span>  said  that  gold  was  found  there  by  the</span><span>  officers  of  tbe  Basilisk,  and  it  is  a  matter</span><span>  of  history  that  the  Papuans  wore  gold</span><span>  trinkets  and  ornaments  on  their  persons.</span><span>  Anothor  fact  of  some  significance  is</span><span>  tho  relative  position  of  New  Guinea  to</span><span>  tho  gold  deposits  of  Australia,  as  part</span><span>  of  it  is  within  the  longitudinal  bolt</span><span>  which  includes  nearly  all  the  important</span><span>  !  goldfields  as  yet  discovered  on  (bis  con</span><span>  .  tinont.  But  gold  is  not  necessary  to</span><span>  I  the  successful  seulement  of  Now  Guinea.</span></p> <p><span>  According  to  Capt.  MonEsnr  and  othor</span><span>  I  authorities,  there  is  abundance  of  rich</span><span>  .  agricultural  land  on  those  islands</span></p> <p><span>  eminently  adapted  for  the  growth  of</span><span>  ,  sugar,  coffee,  spices,  and  other  tropical</span><span>  i  productions  of  commercial  value.  Tho</span></p> <p><span>  natives  are  also  intelligent,  docile,  and</span><span>  friendly-not  like,  the  nomad  raca  of</span><span>  this  country,  but  cultivating  the  soil,</span><span>  ,  and  living  in  villages  and  ou  (arms,  in  a</span><span>  .  degree  of  comparative  comfort.</span></p> <p><span>  It  strikes  us  that  this  is  tho  country</span><span>  that  will  to  tho  fullest  extent  meet  the</span><span>  views  of  tbat  class  of  colonists  who  have</span><span>  raised  sugar  growing  in  Queensland  to</span><span>  .  tho  importance  of  a  valuable  and  porma</span><span>  1  neat  interest.  Tho  one  difficulty  they</span></p> <p><span>  experience  is  tho  want  of  suitable  labour.</span><span>  Tboy  hare  hitherto  met  thiB  want  by</span><span>  sending  out  recruiting  vessels  among  tho</span><span>  islands  of  tho  Pacific,  but  the  abuses</span><span>  ¡  which  have  grown  up  in  the  prosecution</span><span>  ,  of  this  traffic,  notably  the  kidnapping</span><span>  ]  practices  of  tho  Fiji  plautcrs,  have</span></p> <p><span>  brought  into  existence  repressive  regu-</span></p> <p><span>  lations,  which  are  almost  if  not</span><span>  ;  altogether  of  a  prohibitory  nature  ;  and</span><span>  I  the  members  of  the  northern  con</span><span>  j  stituoacics,  with  Mr.  FITZGERALD,</span><span>  I  a  large  sugar-planter,  at  their  head,</span></p> <p><span>  now  ask  for  increased  facilities  for</span><span>  the  introduction  of  Coolies.  At  Now</span><span>  Guinea  this  labour  difficulty  wo  may</span><span>  reasonably  presume  would  have  no</span><span>  oxistence,  as  there  is  a  residont  popula-</span><span>  tion  io  every  way  adapted  for  tbe  work</span><span>  of  a  plantation,  and  who  would  most</span><span>  willingly  give  their  services  for  a  rate  of</span><span>  remuneration  far  below  what  is  possible</span><span>  iu  Queensland.  AU  that  is  wanted  to</span><span>  prepare  tho  way  for  tho  planter  at  New</span><span>  Guinea  is  thc  establishment  of  autho-</span><span>  rity  (hero  for  the  complete  security</span><span>  of  life  and  property.

It</span><span>  bas  not  been  issued  hastily,  but  pre-</span><span>  pared  apparently  after  searching  inquiry</span></p> <p><span>  and  careful  délibération.  Mr.  STEPHENS</span></p> <p><span>  has  visited  that  stronghold  of  dummy</span><span>  ism,  the  Darling  Downs,  and  has  no</span><span>  doubt  satisfied  himself  that  the  evil  is</span></p> <p><span>  one  which  may  not  only  be  abated,  but</span><span>  which  the  Government  are  bound  by  all</span><span>  legal  means  to  root  out.  Still,  the  issue</span><span>  of  the  circular  is  but  the  initial  step,  and</span><span>  if  dummying  is  to  be  suppressed,  it  must</span><span>  be  combated  with  a  strong  hand,  and  by</span><span>  a  minister  conscious  of  having  a  clear</span><span>  parliament-try  majority  at  his  back.  The</span><span>  question  therefore  arises,  whether  in  his</span><span>  designs  against  the  dummier,  Mr.  STE-</span><span>  PHENS  is  likely  to  bc  supported  at  least</span><span>  by  the  lower  branch  of  the  Legislature,</span><span>  and  by  the  almost  unanimous  voice  of</span><span>  public  opinion.</span></p> <p><span>  To  give  the  Government  a  chance  of</span><span>  success,  it  is  requisite  that  not  only  should</span><span>  their  object  be  leg.il  and  proper,  but</span><span>  that  they  should  seek  to  attain  it  by</span><span>  strictly  justifiable  means.  lt  ts  not</span><span>  enough  that  the  evil  of  dummyism  ad-</span><span>  mittedly  exists,  and  ought  if  possible  to</span><span>  be  extirpated.  There  is  a  multitude  of</span><span>  other  evils  from  which  society</span><span>  ought  to  be  protected,  but  which</span><span>  it  is  found  practically  impossible</span><span>  to  .suppress  by  legal  means,  or  at  any  rate</span><span>  by  means  in  themselves  not  unjustifiable.</span><span>  Two  wrongs  cannot  make  one  right,  and</span><span>  therefore  it  is  just  possible  that  dummy-</span><span>  ing  may  prove  less  injurious  to  the  pub-</span><span>  lic  than  the  measures  adopted  for  its  re-</span><span>  pression.  We  say  may,  because  we  are</span><span>  not  altogether  without  hope  that  the</span><span>  remedy  sought  to  be  applied  by  the</span><span>  Government  will  prove  morally  unexcep-</span><span>  tionable  and  practically  efficacious.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  commonly  argued  that  all  restric-</span><span>  tions  upon  the  purchase  of  land  are  in-</span><span>  operative-that  the  capitalist  will  always</span><span>  gel  all  he  wants-and  that  the  obstacles</span><span>  placed  in  his  way  are  but  the  parent  of</span><span>  perjury  and  other  kinds  of  public  de-</span><span>  moralisation.  'Diere  is  unquestionably</span><span>  much  truth  in  this  argument,  but  on</span><span>  examination  we  think  it  «i'll  appear  that</span><span>  restrictions  upon  the  purchase  of  land,</span><span>  though  an  admitted  evil,  are  productive</span><span>  of  less  mischief  than  would  be  created</span><span>  by  applying  the  principle  of  absolute</span><span>  free  trade.  It  is  argued  thal  were  the</span><span>  whole  country  thrown  open  to  unlimited</span><span>  free  selection,  the  supply  of  land  would</span><span>  be  so  enormously  in  excess  of  the  de-</span><span>  mand  that  speculation  would  have  no</span><span>  existence.  Hut  the  fallacy  of  this  argu-</span><span>  ment  is  readily  shown  by  reference  to</span><span>  accomplished  facts.</span></p> <p><span>  The  waste  lands  of  (he  Crown  derive</span></p> <p><span>  their  value  from  the  proximity  of</span><span>  population,  or  by  the  speculative  value</span><span>  they  acquire  as  the  magnets  which</span><span>  attract  population.  In  thc  far  west  the</span><span>  present  occupants,  even  were  thc</span><span>  privilege  of  unlimited  free  selection</span><span>  accorded  them,  would  not  perhaps  care  to</span><span>  largely  invest  in  the  purchaseof  theirbroad</span><span>  acres.  Hut  in  the  settled  districts,  and</span><span>  in  the  neighbourhood  of  towns,  the</span></p> <p><span>  effect  of  unlimited  free  selection  would</span><span>  be  to  convert  hundreds  of  square  miles</span><span>  of  waste  lands  into  enormous  private</span><span>  estates-bought,  not  for  actual  occupa-</span><span>  tion  or  improvement,  but  simply  for</span><span>  speculative  purposes.  Thus  we  should</span><span>  soon  see  powerful  associations  of</span><span>  capitalists  buying  up  the  whole  of  the</span><span>  settled  districts  at  a  nominal  cost,  and</span><span>  retailing  them  at  prices  admitting  of</span><span>  splendid  profits  to  the  seller.  By  this</span><span>  means  we  should  create  a  race  of  wealthy</span><span>  land  sharks,  continually  growing  richer  at</span><span>  the  expense  of  the  actual  settler,  and  to</span><span>  the  manifest  detriment  of  the  country.</span></p> <p><span>  And  even  in  the  unsettled  and  remóle</span><span>  districts,  we  should  soon  find  that  un-</span><span>  limited  free  selection  had  deprived  the</span><span>  public  of  the  ""eyes  of  the  country.""</span></p> <p><span>  Anyone  acquainted  with  the  character  of  »</span></p> <p><span>  our  interior  must  be  aware  that  there  are</span><span>  few  runs  which  might  not  be  kept  for</span><span>  ever  sacred  from  intrusion  by  thc</span><span>  judicious  purchase  of  a  tend)  or  even  a</span><span>  twentieth  of  their  gross  area.  There  is</span><span>  little  doubt  that  by  such  means  the</span><span>  alienation  of  one-tenth  of  the  total  area</span><span>  of  the  colony  would  practically  drive  the</span><span>  Government  out  of  thc  land  market,  for</span><span>  the  area  remaining  would  be  rendered</span><span>  actually  as  well  as  nominally  waste  lands</span><span>  of  the  Crown.  Wc  think  few  persons</span></p> <p><span>  hold  that  such  a  result  would  be  bene-</span><span>  ficial  to  the  colony.  The  conclusion,</span><span>  therefore,  is  that  restrictions  upon  the</span><span>  sale  of  Crown  lands,  however  inadvisable</span><span>  in  some  respects,  are  on  the  whole  ab-</span><span>  solutely  necessary  for  the  due  conser-</span><span>  vation  of  the  public  interests.</span></p> <p><span>  Once  admitting  the  necessity  of  restric-</span><span>  tions,  it  becomes  a  question  for  the</span><span>  Legislature  to  determine  as  to  their</span><span>  nature  and  scope.  And  this  determina-</span><span>  tion  having  been  expressed  by  statutory</span><span>  enactment,  it  is  obviously  the  duly  of  the</span><span>  Executive  to  assist  by  all  reasonable</span><span>  means  in  giving  it  effect.  In  im-</span><span>  posing  restrictions  upon  the  sale</span><span>  of  Crown  Lands,  the  Parliament  only</span><span>  expressed  the  dominant  wishes  of  the</span><span>  community  ;  and  the  Government,  as</span><span>  representing  the  majority  of  the  legis-</span><span>  lature,  are  not  justified  in  permitting</span><span>  those  restrictions  lo  be  set  at  nought.</span><span>  On  the  contrary,  it  is  their  clear  duty  to</span><span>  see  that  the  intentions  of  the  Legislature</span><span>  are  respected,  and,  if  a  statute  be  found</span><span>  ineliicacious,  to  suggest  amendments  on</span><span>  the  first  opportunity.  Judged  by  this</span><span>  rule,  it  must  be  admitted  that  the  late</span><span>  Ministryexhibited  an  indifference  towards</span><span>  dummyism  which  cannot  be  wholly</span><span>  excused,  however  exemplary  their</span><span>  conduct  may  have  been  in  other</span><span>  respects.  It  was  probably  this  indiffer-</span></p> <p><span>  ence  which  induced  the  new  House  to</span><span>  strike  the  blow  which  led  to  the  recent</span></p> <p><span>  change  of  Government.  Rightly  or</span><span>  wrongly,  the  public  belief  was  thai  if  Mr.</span><span>  I'AI.MKK  was  not  in  league  with  lite</span><span>  dumniier,  the  hands  of  his  Government</span><span>  were  so  hampered  by  their  connections</span><span>  that  the  restrictive  provisions  of  thc  Land</span><span>  Act  could  not  be  enforced  by  their</span></p> <p><span>  agency.</span></p> <p><span>  The  circular  issued  by  Mr.  STKPHKN'.S</span><span>  appears  to  lay  down  for  the  guidance  of</span><span>  the  Commissioners,  rules  well  within  thc</span><span>  scope  of  the  Land  Act  itself.  So  far  as</span><span>  we  can  perceive,  there  is  no  undue</span><span>  stringency  attached  to  the  restrictive</span><span>  provisions.  The  directions  are  plain</span></p> <p><span>  and  moderate  in  tone.  Hut  their</span><span>  effect,  if  they  be  enforced  with  a</span><span>  firm  and  impartial  hand,  will  be  im-</span><span>  portant.  lt  is  open  to  much  doubt,</span><span>  however,  whether  the  present  MINISTKK</span><span>  FOR  LANDS  will  be  much  mote  firm</span><span>  and  impartial  than  his  predecessors</span><span>  in  office.  The  dtimmier  commands</span><span>  influence  on  both  sides  of  the  House,</span><span>  and  his  boldness  and  unscrupulousness</span><span>  has  been  most  faithfully  reflected  by  men</span><span>  ranking  themselves  amongst  the  Liberal</span><span>  party.  Thc  DAVKNI'ORTS  and  the</span><span>  TAVLORS  have  been  held  up  as  types  of</span><span>  our  most  liberal  politicians,  but  in  their</span><span>  case  liberal  opinions  have  been  no</span><span>  obstacle  to  their  engaging  in  deep-laid</span><span>  schemes  to  defraud  the  public  of  its</span><span>  lands.  It  remains  to  be  seen  whether</span></p> <p><span>  these  men  will  lie  impartially  brought  to</span><span>  book,  or  whether  their  former  services  to</span><span>  the  Liberal  Parly  will  be  held  to  furnish</span></p> <p><span>  an  excuse  for  their  recent  misconduct.</span><span>  Of  one  thing  Mr.  STKI'HKNS  may  rest</span><span>  assured,-the  slightest  manifestation  of</span><span>  partiality  or  weakness,  either  on  the  part</span><span>  of  himself  or  his  subordinates,  will  ensure</span><span>  his  own  defeat,  and  bring  disgrace  and</span><span>  discomfiture  on  his  party.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  tlie  Police  Court  yesterday  morning,</span><span>  before  Messrs.

SEPTEMBER  10,  1874.</span></p> <p><span>  THOSE  who  fully  comprehend  the  issues</span><span>  involved  in  the  question  of  what  is</span><span>  termed  reciprocal  free  interchange</span><span>  amongst  the  colonies,  will  not  be  at  all</span><span>  surprised  at  finding  our  Chamber  of</span><span>  Commerce  Committee  unprepared  to</span><span>  discuss  it  yesterday.  It  is  indeed  a</span><span>  question  full  of  complications,  and  is,  as</span><span>  Mr.  PATTISON  observed,  really  a  measure</span><span>  of  protection  under  the  guise  of  free</span><span>  trade.  It  may  be  all  very  well  for</span><span>  Chambers  .of  Commerce  to  pronounce</span><span>  affirmatively  upon  reciprocity  as  upon</span><span>  any  other  abstraction,  but  when  the</span><span>  principle  comes  to  be  embodied  in</span><span>  practice,  difficulties  of  various  kinds</span><span>  start  up  and  embarrass  the  legis-</span><span>  lator.  Perhaps  the  greatest  of  these</span><span>  is,  that  it  means  a  relinquish-</span><span>  ment  of  revenue,  which  Colonial</span><span>  Treasurers  generally  can  ill  afford.  The</span><span>  benefit,  too,  would  be  problematical.</span><span>  Possibly  the  South  Australian  Treasurer</span><span>  might  be  induced  to  look  with  a  favour-</span><span>  able  eye  upon  a  proposal  which,  while</span><span>  involving  a  loss  of  revenue,  would  give</span><span>  the  public  of  that  colony  cheap  sugar.</span><span>  But  the  reciprocity  proposed  would</span><span>  not  have  this  effect.  It  would</span><span>  simply  place  the  Queensland  sugar</span><span>  grower  on  a  level  with  his  con-</span><span>  temporary  in  the  Mauritius  so  far  as</span><span>  South  Australia  is  concerned,  and  could</span><span>  not  appreciably  affect  the  price  of  sugar</span><span>  to  the  consumer  in  that  colony.  The</span><span>  wine-producer  there  would,  in  fact,  get</span><span>  thc  benefit  of  a  market  in  Queensland,</span><span>  but  at  what  cost  to  the  colony  of  South</span><span>  Australia?  Why,  simply  by  loss  of</span><span>  the  amount  previously  realised  from</span><span>  the  sugar  duty.  The  same  effect</span><span>  would  be  produced  were  the  TREASURER</span><span>  to  distribute  said  duty  among  the  wine</span><span>  growers,  in  proportion  to  the  number  of</span><span>  gallons  they  each  manufactured,  and</span><span>  there  would  be  the  advantage  that  inter-</span><span>  colonial  complications  would  arise  out  of</span><span>  the  transaction.  In  Queensland,  again,</span><span>  the  TREASURER  might  hand  over  tlie</span><span>  amount  of  duty  collected  on  colonial</span></p> <p><span>  wine  to  our  sugar-growers,  and  thus  save,</span></p> <p><span>  the  embarrassment  usually  attending</span><span>  fiscal  diplomacy.  Such  a  distribution  of</span><span>  the  public  moneys  would  be  unparalleled,</span><span>  no  doubt,  but  if  it  accomplish  precisely</span><span>  the  same  object  as  reciprocity,  it  would</span><span>  be  a  much  simpler  mode  of  protecting</span><span>  the  South  Australian  wine-growers  against</span><span>  their  colonial  competitors,  and  their</span><span>  cheap  labour  rivals  at  the  Mauritius.  If</span><span>  the  South  Australians  desire  chea])  sugar,</span><span>  their  obviously  wisest  course  will  be  to</span><span>  abolish  the  duty  altogether  ;  for  even  if</span><span>  reciprocity  with  Queensland  lead  to  the</span><span>  general  use  of  Queensland  sugars  in  pre-</span><span>  ference  to  those  from  the  Mauritius,  the</span><span>  selling  price  must  not  be  materially</span><span>  reduced,  or  the  Queensland  planter  would</span><span>  find  the  benefit  of  reciprocity  mythical.</span><span>  In  wine  there  is  more  margin  for  reduc-</span><span>  tion,  and  there  is  no  doubt  that  were</span><span>  South  Australian  wines  introduced  here</span></p> <p><span>  free  of  duty,  both  the  producer  and  con-</span><span>  sumer  would  derive  benefit.  The  former</span><span>  would  have  a  monopoly  of  the-Queens</span><span>  land  market,  while  the  latter  would  get</span><span>  a  pure  and  wholesome  beverage  at  a</span><span>  moderate  price.  Birt  the  expedient  would</span><span>  be  a  clumsy  and  unsatisfactory  one,  .ind</span><span>  it  certainly  would  be  discordant  to  the</span><span>  spirit  of  theage,  which  seeks  to  liberate  com-</span><span>  merce  from  all  trammels  and  monopolies,</span><span>  and  allow  to  the  people  of  every  portion</span><span>  of  the  globe  the  full  benefit  of  its  own</span><span>  natural  advantages.  If  the  Queensland</span><span>  sugar-grower  cannot  compete  with  the</span><span>  Mauritius  planter,  his  wisest  course  is  to</span><span>  direct  his  energy  into  some  other</span><span>  channel,  and  raise  some  product  which</span><span>  the  soil  and  climate  of  Queensland  are</span><span>  pre-eminently  fitted  for.  But  our  belief</span><span>  is,  that  the  case  of  our  planters  is  not  so</span><span>  bad  as  is  represented,  and  as  cheap</span><span>  labour  is  now  procurable  in  unlimited</span><span>  quantity,  we  expect  to  see  a  continued</span><span>  increase  in  the  sugar  exports  from  this</span><span>  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  We  must  not  bc  understood  to  be</span><span>  unfavourable  to  the  introduction  of</span></p> <p><span>  colonial  wine  duty  free.  On  the  con-</span><span>  trary,  we  hold  that  there  are  reasons  of</span><span>  public  policy  why  the  impost  on  all  light</span></p> <p><span>  wines  should  be  abolished.  The  almost</span><span>  universal  use  of  ardent  spirits  is  a  curse</span><span>  to  the  colony,  and  were  a  sound  whole-</span><span>  some  wine  procurable  at  a  low  price,  we</span><span>  believe  its  use  would  become  general,</span><span>  with  marked  benefit  to  the  general  health</span><span>  and  social  condition  of  the  people.  The</span><span>  State  would  thus  lose  revenue  through</span><span>  the  diminished  consumption  of  spirituous</span><span>  liquors,  it  is  true,  bul  the  loss  would  be</span><span>  more  than  conterbalanccd  by  the  gain</span><span>  from  the  quickened  industry  of  the</span><span>  bread-winning  portion  of  the  community,</span><span>  and  the  consequent  prosperity  of  all</span><span>  classes.  _  Ardent  spirits  are  -  maddening,</span><span>  demoralising,  and  destructive  of  the</span><span>  vital  energy  of  their  votaries,  while  pure</span><span>  wine  not  only  gladdens  the  heart  of  man,</span><span>  but  is  also  promotive  of  his  bodily</span><span>  health,  especially  in  a  climate  whose</span><span>  summer  heat  is  decidedly  enervating.</span><span>  While,  therefore,  we  have  no  faith  in</span><span>  limited  reciprocity,  wc  are  strong  advo-</span><span>  cates  for  the  admission  of  all  light  sound</span><span>  wines  duty  free.

The  attempt  to  legislate</span><span>  has  shaken  confidence  and  raised  hopes  ;</span></p> <p><span>  and  the  failure  has  not  restored  confi-</span><span>  dence,  while  it  has  naturally  created</span><span>  much  disappointment.  Our  coast  squat</span><span>  tages  have  become  almost  valueless  in</span><span>  tim  eyes  of  capitalists,  and  intending</span><span>  selectors,  who  were  waiting  to  pick  out</span><span>  the  eyes  of  the  resumed  runs,  have  been</span><span>  compelled  to  postpone  their  projects</span><span>  indefinitely.  It  remains  to  be  seen,</span><span>  however,  what  will  bc  the  effect  of  thus</span><span>  blocking  legislation.  It  may  be  hoped</span><span>  that  reflection  will  moderate  extravagant</span><span>  opinions  on  both  sides,  and  at  thc</span><span>  re-assembling  of  Parliament  leave  ex-</span><span>  treme  politicians  in  a  better  frame  of</span><span>  mind  than  they  have  enjoyed  during  thc</span></p> <p><span>  recent  session.  The  ""  ultras  ""  on  both</span><span>  sides  wanted  a  great  deal  too  much.</span><span>  Honorable  members  who  professed  to</span><span>  support  a  ""  Liberal  ""  Government,</span><span>  wished  unceremoniously  to  drive  the</span><span>  Crown  tenant  into  the  ""  back  tracks,""</span><span>  while  several  ardent  representatives  of</span><span>  the  grazing  interest  were  determined  to</span><span>  yield  not  one  inch  of  their  territory  with-</span><span>  out  compensation.  The  Government,  in</span><span>  a  crooked,  clumsy  way  attempted  to  con-</span><span>  ciliate  the  two.  They  purposed  resuming</span><span>  thc  whole  of  the  settled  districts,  whether</span><span>  wanted  or  not,  and  leave  the  unsealed</span><span>  districts  sacredly  untouched.  As  a</span><span>  plaister  upon  thc  wound  caused  by  their</span><span>  bill,  they  purposed  also  to  issue  new</span><span>  leases  of  the  confiscated  squattages,</span><span>  which  were  really  to  afford  a  better</span><span>  tenure  titan  was  given  by  the  law  of</span><span>  1868.  Instead  of  placingthe  interests  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  Crown  tenant  in  the  hands  of  a  liberal</span><span>  Government,  they  would  commit  them  to</span><span>  the  tender  mercies  of  the  individual  free</span><span>  selector,  who  would  have  the  range  of</span><span>  the  whole  country,  from  Point  Danger  to</span><span>  Carpentaria,  and  the  liberty  to  establish</span><span>  his  homestead  wherever  he  thought  fit.</span><span>  Each  selector  might  pick  out  an  ""  eye,""</span><span>  and  in  establishing  his  isolated  residence</span><span>  might  at  the  same  time  establish  a</span><span>  chronic  quarrel  between  himself  and  the</span><span>  pastoral  tenant  whose  domain  he  in-</span><span>  vaded.  The  result  would  have  been  the</span><span>  advent  of  good  times  for  lawyers  and</span><span>  poundkeepers,  and  prolonged  and  bitter</span><span>  agitation  in  the  political  arena.  And</span><span>  unfortunately  experience  teaches  that</span><span>  when  men  differ  in  politics  differences</span><span>  also  arise  in  social  matters.  A  man</span><span>  whose  political  creed  is  at  fault  receives</span><span>  the  cut,  oblique  or  direct,  from  his  ac-</span><span>  quaintances,  and  becomes  the  unhappy</span><span>  victim  of  social  ostracism.  This  may</span><span>  not  be  a  very  deep  cause  of  grief  to</span><span>  the  victim,  but  its  effect  is  not  beneficial</span><span>  to  society  at  large,  or  productive  of</span><span>  unanimity  of  opinion.</span></p> <p><span>  Although,  therefore,  the  postponement</span><span>  of  resumption,  as  a  solitary  fact,  is  un-</span><span>  doubtedly  an  evil,  it  is  possibly  a  less</span><span>  evil  than  the  Ministry  proposed  to  inflict</span><span>  upon  the  country  by  their  Land  Bill.  It</span><span>  must  be  admitted  that  unnecessary  legis-</span><span>  lative  changes  are  pernicious,  and  that</span><span>  in  so  far  as  the  changes  proposed  by  the</span><span>  Land  Bill  were  unnecessary  they  were</span><span>  also  undesirable.  Wholesale  resumption</span><span>  was  certainly  unnecessary,  and  as  certainly</span><span>  its  effect  upon  the  community  would  have</span><span>  been  mischievous.  It  is  on  this  ground</span><span>  that  the  Legislative  Council  may  well</span><span>  take  their  stand,  and  rind  a  defence</span><span>  for  their  otherwise  indefensible  conduct</span><span>  in  throwing  out  both.  Land  Bill  and</span><span>  Resuming  Resolutions.  The  function  of</span><span>  the  Council  is  to  resist  rash  changes,</span><span>  and  in  this-  matter  it  must  be  allowed</span><span>  that  their  resistance  was  justified.  The</span><span>  country  wanted  land  thrown  open  for</span><span>  settlement,  but  it  did  not  want  the</span><span>  Ministerial  Land  Bil!.  Had  the  right</span><span>  method  been  taken  in  the  first  instance,</span><span>  the  Government  might  have  easily  pro-</span><span>  vided  the  former  without  agitating  the</span><span>  community  by  the  latter.  Had  resuming</span><span>  resolutions  for  actual  requirements  been</span><span>  submitted  at  the  beginning  of  the  session,</span><span>  they  would  certainly  have  been  adopted</span><span>  by  the  Assembly  without  serious  demur,</span><span>  and  if  rejected  by  the  Council  would</span><span>  have  exhibited  that  body  in  no  favour-</span><span>  able  light.  Indeed,  it  can  hardly  be</span></p> <p><span>  conceived  that  honorable  members  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  Council,  musty  as  their  opinions  be,</span></p> <p><span>  would  have  ventured  to  refuse  the  re-</span></p> <p><span>  sumption  of  land  for  actual  require-</span></p> <p><span>  ments.</span></p> <p><span>  Of  course  the  Ministerial  poltcywillnow</span><span>  be  to  raise  a  cry  against  the  upper  House</span><span>  and  promise  to  bring  in  a  still  more</span><span>  sweeping  land  bill  next  year.  But  it  is</span><span>  unfortunate  that  the  imbroglio  is  chiefly</span><span>  due  to  their  own  want  of  judgment,  and</span><span>  that  popular  indignation  will  be  divided</span><span>  between  them  and  their  opponents,</span><span>  instead  of  being  directed  in  full  force</span><span>  against  the  senile  politicians  of  the</span><span>  Upper  Chamber.  The  continued  locking</span><span>  up  of  the  lands  is,  however,  a  real</span><span>  public  grievance,  and  unless  some</span><span>  of  our  squatters  profit  by  thc</span><span>  example  set  by  the  Messrs.  ARCH  KU,</span><span>  and  voluntarily  surrender  such  portions  of</span><span>  their  runs  as  may  be  needed  to  supply</span><span>  the  bona  fide  demands  of  intending</span><span>  settlers,  there  will  be  a  very  pretty  quarrel</span><span>  in  a  fewinonthshence.  Sucli  aquarrelcan</span><span>  only  end  in  one  way,  and  it  may  be</span><span>  hoped  that  Australian  histor)'  will  not  be</span><span>  allowed  to  repeat  itself  too  strikingly  in</span><span>  this  colony.

The  trustee,  under  direction</span></p> <p><span>  from  the  court,  may  receive  and  open  the</span><span>  post  letters  addressed  to  an  insolvent;</span><span>  but  this  power  can  only  be  conferred  for</span><span>  a  period  of  three  months  subsequent  to</span><span>  adjudication.</span></p> <p><span>  General  provisions  affecting  the  ad-</span><span>  ministration  of  estates  require  that  the</span><span>  insolvent  should,  to  thc  utmost  of  his</span><span>  power,  assist  in  the  realisation  of  his</span><span>  property,  and  in  its  distribution  amongst</span><span>  his  creditors;  and  in  thc  event  of  neglect</span><span>  or  failure  he  will,  in  addition  to  any</span><span>  other  penalty  incurred,  be  punishable  for</span><span>  I  contempt  of  court.

An  appeal  from  any  act  or</span><span>  decision  of  the  trustee  lies  to  the  court,</span><span>  who  may  summon  general  meetings  of</span><span>  creditors  and  direct  the  registrar  to</span><span>  preside  at  such  meetings.

By</span><span>  sections  132  and  133  the  trustee's</span><span>  powers  to  deal  with  property  are</span><span>  defined  at  length.  He  may  carry</span><span>  on  die  business  of  an  insolvent  so  far</span></p> <p><span>  as  may  be  necessary  for  the  beneficial</span><span>  winding  up  of  the  same,  exercise  power</span><span>  1  of  attorney  ;  sell  the  property  of  an</span></p> <p><span>  insolvent  either  by  public  auction  or</span><span>  private  contract,  give  receipts  for</span><span>  money,  and  draw  dividends.  With  the</span><span>  sanction  of  the  committee  of  inspection,</span><span>  the  trustee  may  mortgage  an  insolvent's</span><span>  property  to  raise  money  for  the  payment</span><span>  of  his  debts  ;  appoint  the  insolvent</span><span>  himself  to  manage  the  business  or</span><span>  realise  ;  bring  or  defend  any  actions  at</span><span>  law  relating  to  the  property  of  the</span><span>  insolvent1;  refer  a  dispute  to  arbitration,</span><span>  and  compromise  debts  and  claims;</span><span>  divide  amongst  creditors,  according  to</span><span>  its  estimated  value,  any  property  .which</span><span>  cannot  be  conveniently  realised  upon  by</span><span>  sale  ;  and  employ  a  short-hand  writer  to</span><span>  take  notes  at  any  meeting  of  creditors  or</span><span>  examination  under  this  Act.  The</span></p> <p><span>  trustee  may  also  accept  a  composition,</span><span>  with  the  sanction  of  a  general  meeting</span><span>  of  creditors,  and,  after  approval  by  the</span><span>  court,  such  composition  will  be  binding</span><span>  on  all  the  creditors.  By  section  136  a</span><span>  trustee  is  required  to  pay  all  moneys</span><span>  into  a  bank,  and  if  he  keep  more  than</span><span>  £50  in  his  hands  beyond  ten  days,  he</span><span>  will  be  subject  to  pay  interest  at  the</span><span>  rate  of  twenty  per  cent  per  annum,  and</span><span>  to  dismissal  without  remuneration.  This</span><span>  is  another  attempt  to  remedy  a  notorious</span><span>  abuse  under  the  existing  law,  and  as</span><span>  such  must  be  regarded  with  satisfaction.</span></p> <p><span>  Sections  140  to  151  inclusive  provide</span><span>  for  proof  of  debts  and  distribution  of</span><span>  assets.  Unliquidated  damages  will  not</span><span>  ""be  provable,  nor  will  debts  incurred  by</span></p> <p><span>  the  insolvent  after  the  fact  of  his  in-</span><span>  solvency  has  been  notified.  All  debts</span><span>  must  be  proved  before  the  trustee,  and</span><span>  the  following  are  to  be  deemed  pre-</span><span>  ferential  claims,  viz.  :-Local  rates  due</span><span>  within  twelve  months  previous  to  the</span><span>  order  of  adjudication,  and  all  wages  or</span><span>  salary  of  any  clerk,  servant,  labourer,  pr</span><span>  workman  in  the  employment  of  the</span><span>  insolvent  not  exceeding  ^50  or  three</span><span>  months'  wages.  All  other  debts  proved</span><span>  are  to  be  paid  pari  passu.  Insolvency</span><span>  terminates  apprenticeships,  but  th*</span><span>  trustee  may  on  application  transfer  any</span><span>  indenture.  No  distress  for  rent  may  be</span></p> <p><span>  levied  upon  an  insolvent  after  adjudica-1</span><span>  lion,  but  a  landlord  will  have  a  pre-</span><span>  ferential  claim  to  the  extent  of  three</span><span>  months'  rent.  Interest  may  also  bc</span></p> <p><span>  allowed  by  the  trustee,  computed  up  to  ¡</span><span>  the  date  of  adjudication.  The  trustee,  |</span><span>  with  the  consent  of  creditors,  may  make</span></p> <p><span>  an  allowance  to  an  insolvent  for  main-  J</span><span>  tenance  or  service.  Under  section  150  |</span><span>  set-offs  are  allowed  in  case  of  mutual  j</span><span>  dealings  between  debtor  and  creditor,</span><span>  and  provision  is  subsequently  made  for</span></p> <p><span>  tile  protection  of  secured  creditors.  j</span></p> <p><span>  Dividends  must  be  declared  from  time</span><span>  to  lime,  and  if  the  trustee  declare  no</span><span>  ,  dividend  for  a  period  of  si*  months,  he</span><span>  I  must  summon  a  meeting  oí  creditors,</span></p> <p><span>  and  tell  the  reason  why.  Notice  of</span><span>  dividends  must  be  given  in  the  Gazelle</span><span>  and  other  newspapers.  No  action  for</span><span>  any  dividend  will  lie  against  a  trustee,</span><span>  but  he  may  be  ordered  to  pay  it,  with</span><span>  interest  thereon,  out  of  his  own  moneys,</span><span>  if  tlie  Court  think  fit.  Any  surplus</span><span>  moneys,  after  payment  of  the  final</span><span>  dividend,  is  to  be  paid  to  the  insolvent.</span></p> <p><span>  At  the  last  examination  for  closing</span><span>  the  insolvency,  an  adjournment  may  b;</span><span>  ordered  if  the  insolvent's  accounts  are</span><span>  unsatisfactory,  or  if  he  have  disobeyed</span><span>  any  order  of  thc  court.  When  thc  whole</span><span>  property  of  the  insolvent,  or  as  much  as</span><span>  can  be  realised  without  needlessly  pro-</span><span>  tracting  the  insolvency  has  been  realised,</span><span>  tlie  court  will  mähe  an  order  that  the</span><span>  insolvency  has  closed  ;  and  at  any  time</span><span>  after  the  insolvent  has  yjassed  his  last,</span><span>  examination,  or  at  any  earlier  time  after</span><span>  consent  by  a  meeting  of  creditors,  a  cer-</span><span>  tificate  of  discharge  may  be  granted  ;</span><span>  but  the  court  must  first  be  satisfied  (i)</span><span>  that  thc  insolvency  has  arisen  from  cir-</span></p> <p><span>  cumstances  which  the  insolvent  cannot</span><span>  justly  be  held  responsible  for:  or  (2)</span><span>  that  a  spi-cial  resolution,  expressing  the</span><span>  opinion  of  the  creditors  to  that  effect  lias</span><span>  been  passed  ;  or  (3)  thal  the  gross</span><span>  amount  realised  in  tlie  estate  is  equal  tp</span><span>  the  total  amount  of  debts  proved.  The</span><span>  court  may  also,  if  it  think  fit*!,  suspend</span><span>  tlie  certificate  on  other  grounds.  Pro-</span></p> <p><span>  vision  is  further  nude  for  the  issue  of</span><span>  the  certificate  after  the  lapse  of  time,</span><span>  viz.,  at  the  expiration  of  twelve  months,</span></p> <p><span>  with  the  written  consent  of  the;  majority</span><span>  of.creditors,  or  at  the  expiration'of  two</span></p> <p><span>  years  without  such  consent.  And  in  the</span><span>  event  of  such  certificate  being  again</span><span>  withheld,  it  may  be  granted  with  the</span><span>  consent  of  creditors  at  the  expiration  of</span><span>  three  years.  A  certificate  may  also  be</span><span>  granted  subject  to  certain  conditions  as  to</span><span>  the  insolvent's  salary  or  earnings.  Such</span><span>  certificate  will  not  release  the  insolvent</span></p> <p><span>  j  from  fraudulent  debts,  from  debts  due  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  Crown,  or  from  debts  arising  from</span><span>  any  offence  against  a  statute,  or  iucurrcd</span></p> <p><span>  ¡  on  a  bail  bond.  But  it  will  bc  a  full</span><span>  discharge  from  all  other  debts.  Section</span><span>  176  fixes  the  status  of  an  undischarged</span><span>  insolvent  No  debt  provable  under  the</span><span>  insolvency  may  be  enforced  against  him</span><span>  for  a  period  of  three  years  after  die  close</span><span>  of  such  insolvency,  and  if  after  that</span><span>  time  he  pay  up  the  balance  of  twenty</span><span>  shillings  in  the  pound  he  will  bc  entitled</span><span>  to  his  certificate  of  discharge  ;  and</span><span>  if  he  have  not,  at  the  expiration  of  titree</span><span>  years,  obtained  a  certificate  of  discharge,</span><span>  the  balance  of  debts  due  in  insolvency</span><span>  will  be  deemed  a  subsisting,  debt  in  the</span><span>  nature  of  a  judgment  debt,  which,  with</span><span>  the  sanction  of  the  Supreme  Court,  may</span><span>  be  enforced  against  property  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  debtor.</span></p> <p><span>  The  remaining  sections  of  this  Act  :</span><span>  must  be  reserved  for  a  third  notice.  !</span></p> ",Article,1874-07-23,"The Rockhampton Bulletin.

The  persistency  with</span><span>  which  this  doctrine  is  laid  doini  has  cer-</span></p> <p><span>  tainly  obtained  for  it  very  general  belief,</span><span>  just  as  in  past  years  it  was  almost</span><span>  universally  held  that  thc  most  fertile</span><span>  parts  of  Queensland  would  scarcely</span><span>  grow  a  cabbage.  We  confess  therefore</span><span>  that  a  return  just  furnished  to  the  Honor-</span><span>  able  the  Minister  for  Land«  by  the</span><span>  proprietor  of  the  Allora  steam  flour  mills,</span><span>  has  overcome  us  with  gratified  surprise.</span><span>  It  appears  that  thirty  farmers,  whose</span><span>  names  arc  specified,  have  cultivated  an</span><span>  area  of  300  acres  in  the  Allora  district</span><span>  this  year,  and  that  the  gross  yield  of</span></p> <p><span>  wheat  therefrom  is  eleven  thousand  five</span></p> <p><span>  hundred  and  sixty-two  bushels,  or  at  j</span><span>  the  rate  of  over  thirty-eight  bushels  to  the</span><span>  acre.  In  South  Australia,  we  observe,</span><span>  the  average  yield  of  the  year  is  given  as</span><span>  under  thirteen  bushels  lo  thc  acre,  and</span><span>  that  is  regarded  as  a  good  yield.  If</span><span>  therefore  a  yield  of  thirteen  bushels  will</span><span>  pay  for  cultivation,  the  Darling  Downs</span><span>  farmer  can  afford  to  lose  two  crops  out</span><span>  of  three,  and  still  be  little  worse  off  than</span><span>  his  South  Australian  contemporary.  So</span><span>  much  for  thc  assertion  that  wheat-growing</span><span>  in  Queensland  will  not  pay.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  no  doubt,  however,  that  these</span><span>  wholesale  and  reckless  assertions  have</span><span>  done  great  injury  to  the  agricultural</span><span>  interest  in  Queensland,  not  so  much</span><span>  from  the  weight  of  authority  which  has</span><span>  attached  to  them,  as  from  thc  numerous</span><span>  failures  made  by  settlers  in  this  colony.</span><span>  A  man  who  goes  into  any  ordinary</span><span>  business  without  experience  and  without</span><span>  capital  is  seldom  expected  to  succeed,</span><span>  but  it  has  been  supposed  by  many  enthu-</span><span>  siasts  that  the  man  who  undertakes  the</span><span>  cultivation  of  the  soil  can  hardly  fail.</span><span>  The  truth  is  that  experience,  capital,  and</span><span>  unremitting  industry  are  just  as  essential</span><span>  in  ihn  farnjor  ac  fra  any  oilier  colonist,</span><span>  and  if  in  thc  absence  of  these,  cultivation</span><span>  will  not  pay,  it  is  childish  to  lay  the</span><span>  blame  upon  thc  soil  or  climate.  Yet</span><span>  this  is  every  day  done  by  many  of  the</span><span>  most  intelligent  people  in  the  colony,</span><span>  who  would  be  amongst  the  first  to</span><span>  ridicule  such  inconsequcntal  reasoning</span><span>  if  applied  to  any  other  of  the  affairs  of</span><span>  life.  Still,  the  fact  is  undoubted  that  the</span><span>  assertion  that  cultivation  will  not  pay,  has</span><span>  become  a  household  word,  and  lias  pre-</span><span>  vented  the  investment  of  capital  in  farm-</span><span>  ing  pursuits.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  district  of  Rockhampton  this</span><span>  has  notably  been  the  case.  Four  years</span><span>  ago,  when  attention  was  being  turned  to</span><span>  sugar  cultivation  in  Queensland,  one  of</span><span>  our  oldest  and  most  highly  respected</span><span>  colonists  delivered  a  lecture  to  prove  that</span><span>  sugar  could  not  be  profitably  grown  in</span><span>  our  district.  Rockhampton,  lie  said,</span><span>  was  situated  in  a  dry  bell,</span><span>  and  the  soil  on  our  river  banks</span><span>  was  not  fertile.  The  uninviting  appear-</span><span>  ance  of  tile  land  adjacent  lo  the  town</span><span>  attached  weight  lo  this  assumption,  and</span><span>  hence  to  this  day  no  capitalist  has  been</span><span>  imprudent  enough  to  embark  money  in</span><span>  sugar  cultivation  here.  It  is  trite  that</span><span>  in  two  different  parts  of  the  district  a</span><span>  considerable  acreage  of  fine  sugar  cane</span><span>  was  grown,  bul  the  owners  lacked  ihe</span><span>  capital  to  provide  llie  requisite  ma-</span><span>  chinery,  and  hence  the  cane  went  lo</span><span>  feed  horses  and  cattle  instead  of</span><span>  sugar  mills.  And  if  in  one  case  ihe</span><span>  unprecedentedly  severe  frost  did  much</span><span>  damage,  and  in  the  other  thc  late  hurri-</span><span>  cane  committed  great  havoc,  those  were</span><span>  accidents  which  might  have  happened</span><span>  anywhere,  and  certainly  did  not  go  to</span><span>  prove  that  the  cane  cannot  be  profitably</span><span>  cultivated  in  our  district  Vet  capitalists</span><span>  hang  back,  and  prefer  encountering  the</span><span>  inconveniences  of  residence  in  the  far</span><span>  north,  to  investing  their  means  in  a  part</span><span>  of  the  colony  which  is  really,  as  well  as</span><span>  nominally,  in  the  settled  districts.</span></p> <p><span>  Yet  lhere  is  an  unsalable  demand  fol-</span><span>  land  tn  the  Rockhampton  district,  and</span><span>  all  that  is  worth  having  is  caught  up  im-</span><span>  mediately  after  it  is  thrown  open  for</span><span>  selection.  Hut  it  is  apparent}}-  not</span><span>  «?anted  for  cultivation.  Hain-  '  farm-</span><span>  ing  and  slock  raising  appears  to  be  tile</span><span>  height  of  our  settlers'  ambition,  and</span><span>  tims  the  progress  of  lite  district</span><span>  is  extremely  slow.  Rockhampton</span><span>  owes  its  prosperity  to  trudie  with  the</span><span>  interior,  and  not  to  settlement  in  its</span><span>  neighbourhood,  while  at  brisbane,  Mary-</span><span>  borough,  and  Mackay,  the  producers  of</span><span>  the  soil  are  amongst  the  best  «istomers</span><span>  of  the!  mechanic  and  shopkeeper,  mid</span><span>  consequently  the  chief""  supporters  of  the</span><span>  trading  community.</span></p> <p><span>  Were  we  not  convinced  of  the  utter</span></p> <p><span>  fallacy  of  the  dry  belt  theory  as  applied</span><span>  to  our  district,  and  of  the  unjust  de-</span><span>  preciation  lo  which  the  character  of  its</span><span>  soil  has  been  subjected,  we  might  accept</span><span>  the  position  of  a  non-agricultural  district</span><span>  without  repining.  Hut  convinced  as  we</span><span>  are  thal  no  part  of  the  colony  presents</span><span>  greater  attractions  lo  the  settler  com-</span><span>  bining  cultivation  with  grazing,  we</span><span>  ?  think  that  some  concerted  effort</span></p> <p><span>  should  be  made  to  disprove  the</span><span>  unfavorable  assertions  which  have</span><span>  operated  as  a  drag  upon  the  progress  of</span><span>  our  district.  Had  a  third  of  the  money</span><span>  which  was  lost  in  quartz-reefing  been</span><span>  invested  in  sugar-growing,  we  should</span><span>  have  found  Rockhampton  in  a  different</span><span>  position  to-day.  It  is  therefore  just  a</span><span>  question  whether  even  now  it  would  not</span><span>  be  desirable  to  form  a  sugar-growing</span><span>  company,  with  ample  capital.

The  money</span><span>  spent  at  various  limes  in  attempting  to</span><span>  improve  the  navigation  of  the  river  has</span><span>  been  wor.se  than  thrown  away.  The</span><span>  steam  dredge  has  been  lying  idle  for</span><span>  years,  while  the  steam-lug  Mary,  which</span><span>  was  originally  sent  here  as  a  tender  to</span><span>  dredge,  divides  lier  time  between  towing</span><span>  vessels  and  going  under  repair.  if</span><span>  wanted  for  any  emergency  she  is  seldom</span><span>  available,  and  if  the  reports  of  those</span><span>  connected  with  her  be  credited  she  is</span></p> <p><span>  rarely  in  a  seaworthy  condition.  In  the</span></p> <p><span>  meantime  the  loan  votes  for  river  im-</span></p> <p><span>  provement  are  being  steadily  frittered</span><span>  away,  with  the  view,  we  suppose,  of</span><span>  satisfying  that  rather  numerous  class  in</span><span>  the  community  who  hold  thal  matters</span><span>  cannot  go  wrong  so  long  as  the  money</span><span>  is  put  into  ""  circulation.''  Persons,  how</span></p> <p><span>  ever,  who  take  a  more  enlightened  view</span><span>  of  tlic  subject,  hold  thal  the  amount  at</span><span>  the  disposal  of  the  department  might  as</span><span>  well  have  been  thrown  into  the  river  as</span><span>  spent  upon  maintaining  and  repairing  a</span><span>  dredge  which,  judging  by  the  past,  is</span><span>  least  injurious  lo  the  navigation</span><span>  when  laid  up.  Ami  reflection  upon</span><span>  the  subject  is  not  rendered  less  dis-</span><span>  agreeable  by  the  knowledge  that</span><span>  the  dredge  might,  in  skilled  hands,  have</span><span>  done  important  service  in  removing  the</span><span>  obstructions  which  impede  the  naviga-</span><span>  tion  of  the  river.  It  may  be  hoped,</span><span>  however,  that  steps  will  now  be  taken  to</span></p> <p><span>  i  make  the  dredge  as  celebrated  for  utility  j</span></p> <p><span>  in  the  future  as  she  has  been  notorious</span></p> <p><span>  for  uselessness  in  the  past.  The  depart-</span><span>  ment  appears  to  admit  and  regret  thal</span><span>  blunders  have  been  made,  and  in  its</span></p> <p><span>  case,  wc  trust,  repentance  will  be  the  ,</span><span>  first  step  towards  radical  reform.</span></p> <p><span>  lt  is  with  respect  to  the  management</span><span>  of  thc  steamer  Mary,  however,  that  we</span><span>  intend  to  enter  our  protest  to-day.  It  is</span></p> <p><span>  natural  to  conclude  that  if  thcGovcrnmcnl</span><span>  find  it  necessary  to  own  steamships,  they</span><span>  will  keep  them  in  a  state  of  thorough</span><span>  efficiency.  In  these  times,  at  any  rate,</span><span>  our  Government  is  not  troubled  with  a</span><span>  want  of  means,  and  the  public  have</span><span>  therefore  a  right  to  demand  that  cheese-</span><span>  paring  economy  shall  be  no  sufficient</span><span>  excuse  for  inefficiency.  Yet  the  manage-</span><span>  ment  of  the  steamer  Mary  is  chavacter</span></p> <p><span>  I  ised  by  extreme  parsimony.  She  is</span></p> <p><span>  never  placed  in  thorough  repair,  bul</span><span>  merely  patched  up  for  the  time  being.</span><span>  She  is  not  even  provided  with  an</span><span>  engineer,  but  committed  to  the  unskilful</span></p> <p><span>  hands  of  an  untrained  man  who  acts  as</span></p> <p><span>  engine-driver.  Thc  expenses  of  the</span><span>  vessel,  it  is  said,  are  limited  to  six  pounds</span><span>  per  week,  and  this  amount  docs  not</span></p> <p><span>  suffice  for  the  remuneration  of</span><span>  skilled  labour.  Surely  the  force  of</span><span>  folly  could  no  farther  go,  even  were</span><span>  the  steamer  a  permanent  charge  upon</span><span>  the  revenue.  Uut  in  consideration  of</span><span>  the  fact  that  her  earnings,  independent</span><span>  of  mail  carrying,  have  amounted  to  an</span><span>  average  of  over  two  hundred  pounds  a</span><span>  month  since  September  last,  the  false</span><span>  economy  complained  of  must  be  regarded</span><span>  as  a  crime  rather  than  a  blunder.  In</span><span>  the  event  of  a  ""  blow-up,""  or  any  other</span><span>  fatal  accident  occurring  through  want  of</span><span>  skilled  surveillance,  the  public  would</span><span>  demand  that  the  responsibility  bc  placed</span><span>  on  the  right  shoulders.</span></p> <p><span>  Tile  justice  of  these  remarks</span><span>  is  seen  in  the  ""  masterly  in-</span><span>  activity""  displayed  by  the  authorities</span><span>  yesterday.  On  Sunday  evening,  the</span><span>  intelligence  reached  (own  that</span><span>  a  large  vessel  dismasted  had</span><span>  been  that  morning  driven  within  sight</span><span>  of  the  Haid  Hills,  and  that  she  then  lay</span><span>  at  anchor  in  an  exposed  and  dangerous</span><span>  part  of  the  coast.  The  Mary  had</span><span>  started  just  before  the  news  &lt;:aine  to</span><span>  hand,  but  she  should  have  been  at  Glad-</span><span>  stone  by  daylight  yesterday  morning,  and</span><span>  was  then  within  twelve  hours'  steam  ol</span></p> <p><span>  the  distressed  vessel.  A  telegram  might</span><span>  have  been  sent  dispatching  her  to  the</span><span>  rescue,  and  by  nine  or  ten  o'clock  last</span><span>  night  she  should  have  been  alongside  the</span><span>  ship.  The  public  have  an  undoubted</span><span>  right  to  ask  why  was  not  this  done,  and</span><span>  to  receive  an  unequivocal  answer.  If  il</span><span>  be  alleged  that  the  Mary  is  unseaworthy,</span><span>  and  therefore  could  not  be  &lt;lis|vitched  tc</span><span>  a  spot  within  fifty  miles  of  the  Keppel  Kay</span><span>  pilot-station,  the  authorities  will  certainl)</span><span>  be  held  responsible  for  the  mischief  thai</span><span>  may  ensue.  If  the  dismasted  vessc</span><span>  prove  to  be  the  Southern  Helle,  with  42c</span><span>  passengers  on  board  in  addition  to  tin</span><span>  seamen,  the  consequences  of  delay  111.11</span><span>  be  terribly  serious.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  less  excuse  for  the  conditioi</span><span>  of  the  Mary,  on  the  ground  that  withii</span><span>  the  past  six  months  she  was  subjected  t&lt;</span></p> <p><span>  I  a  so-called  ""  thorough  overhaul  ""  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  expense  of  the  Loan  Fund.  The  vole</span><span>  of  ,¿5000  for  improving  the  navigation</span><span>  of  the  Fitzroy  was  misappropriated  to</span></p> <p><span>  J  the  repairs  of  the  steamer,  and  there  being</span></p> <p><span>  a  large  unexpended  balance  of  that  fund</span><span>  still  available,  thc  department  cannot</span><span>  plead  want  of  money  as  an  excuse  for</span><span>  botching  their  work.  'Chere  is,  indeed,</span><span>  so  much  of  the  odour  of  corruption</span><span>  about  the  whole  business  that  it  may  be</span><span>  hoped  the  new  TREASURER  will  make  it</span><span>  the  subject  of  a  searching  inquiry  before</span></p> <p><span>  Parliament  assembles.</span></p> <p><span>  After  thc  above  was  written,  the  plans</span><span>  of  the  Harbour  Department  had  suffi-</span><span>  ciently  matured  to  admit  of  their  laking</span><span>  decisive  action.  As  will  be  learnt  from</span><span>  our  news  columns,  arrangements  were</span><span>  made  yesterday  afternoon  for  employing</span><span>  the  steamer  Queensland  to  tow  in  the</span><span>  disabled  ship  ;  but  as  that  steamer  had</span><span>  not  then  lelt  Maryborough,  and  will  have</span><span>  to  call  at  llundaberg  and  Gladstone,</span><span>  she  cannot  go  to  the  relief  of  the  ship</span><span>  until  Wednesday.  This  delay  might</span><span>  have  been  of  little  consequence,  but  it</span><span>  might  also  have  resulted  in  needless  loss</span><span>  of  life  and  property.  Urgent  represen-</span><span>  tations  were  therefore'  made  to  Captain</span><span>  RtiNiii.!'.  yesterday  afternoon,  which</span><span>  induced  him  to  telegraph  a  peremptory</span><span>  order  to  Gladstone  for  the  Mary,  s.,  to</span><span>  start  immediately  for  the  ship,  it  is  not</span><span>  supposed  that  the  steamer  will  be  able  to</span><span>  low  the  vessel  into  Keppel  Ha)',  but  she</span><span>  may  take  off  the  possibly  starving  passen-</span><span>  gers  and  crew,  or  give  such  other  succour</span><span>  as  the  exigency  of  the  case  may  demand.</span><span>  There  can  he  no  doubt  that  this  tardy</span><span>  step  of  the  Harbour-master  was  a  proper</span><span>  one,  but  the  question  still  remains</span><span>  Wliy  was  not  the  Mary  dispatched</span><span>  some  six  or  seven  hours  earlier?  We</span><span>  shall  be  told  that  Captain  Ri'NW.r.  had</span><span>  no  power  to  act  without  authority  from</span><span>  Ilrisbane,  but  the  public  will  not  accept</span><span>  that  as  a  justification,  however  willing</span><span>  they  may  bc  lo  admit  it  as  a  colourable</span><span>  excuse,  f  In  the  face  of  it  the  plea  is</span><span>  absurd.  Were  five  hundred  lives  known</span></p> <p><span>  to  be  in  imminent  peril  within  fifty  miles</span><span>  of  Rockhampton,  shall  we  be  told  that</span><span>  tile  Mary  could  not  get  up  steam,  and</span><span>  go  to  the  vessel  without  a  departmental</span><span>  order  from  Hrisbane  ?  If  so,  the  regu-</span><span>  lation  is  worse  than  absurd.  The</span><span>  HARHOUR-MASTKR  must  have  some</span></p> <p><span>  discretionary  power,  and  the  public</span><span>  reasonably  demand  that  in  all</span><span>  urgent  cases  he  shall  burst  the  bonds</span><span>  of  red  tape,  and  act  promptly  on  his  own</span><span>  responsibility.  Common  humanity  de-</span><span>  mands  that  a  public  officer  shall  afford</span><span>  the  earliest  possible  succour  to  ship-</span><span>  wrecked  people,  even  at  the  risk  of  a</span><span>  subsequent  departmental  snubbing.</span></p> <p><span>  We  sincerely  hope  that  the  delay</span><span>  complained  of  will  not  prove  disastrous</span><span>  in  this  instance.  If  so,  the  public  may</span><span>  rejoice  that,  without  any  startling  loss  of</span><span>  human  life,  circumstances  have  occurred</span><span>  to  show  thc  imperative  necessity  of</span><span>  greater  discretionary  power  being  com-</span><span>  mitted  to  local  hands,  and  of  greater</span><span>  promptitude  and  /eal  being  displayed  in</span></p> <p><span>  thc  exercise  of  it.</span></p> ",Article,1874-03-03,"The Rockhampton Bulletin.

It  is  now  the  21st</span></p> <p><span>  j  July,  and  the  instructions  to  appoint</span><span>  I  collectors  have  but  just  reached  here.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  more  remote  parts  of  the  colony,</span><span>  the  probability  is  that  the  ist  of  August</span></p> <p><span>  will  arrive  before  thc  instructions  come</span><span>  to  band,  so  that  the  ro!!s  ii)  sucli  places</span><span>  will  not  be  legally  prepared  under  the</span><span>  new  Act.  This  may  be  of  little  conse-</span><span>  quence,  but  it  might  prove  inconvenient</span><span>  did  Mr.  MACALISTER  deem  it  expedient</span><span>  to  appeal  to  the  country  ;  for  were  several</span><span>  electorates  unprovided  with  new  rolls,</span><span>  the  GOVERNOR  would  be  furnished  with</span></p> <p><span>  a  potent  argument  against  granting  a  dis-</span><span>  solution  when  an  important  portion  of  the</span><span>  constituent  body  would  be  disfranchised</span><span>  through  official  tardiness  in  bringing  the</span><span>  new  law  into  operation.  In  the  Central</span><span>  districts,  however,  the  Mitchell  is  the</span><span>  only  electorate  in  which  it  may  be  found</span><span>  impracticable  to  comply  with  the  require-</span><span>  ments  of  the  Act  in  this  respect.</span></p> <p><span>  The  collectors  having  made  a  declara-</span><span>  tion  to  ensure  faithful  performance  of</span><span>  the  duties  imposed  upon  them,  will  start</span><span>  on  their  journeys  through  the  various</span><span>  electorates,  and  before  the  31st  August</span><span>  must  prepare  alphabetical  lists  of  all</span><span>  persons  qualified  to  vote  within  their</span><span>  respective  districts.  These  lists  are  to</span></p> <p><span>  show  in  the  usual  form  where  each  elector</span></p> <p><span>  resides,  what  is  his  qualification,  and  where</span><span>  his  property  is  situate  or  how  his  claim</span><span>  arises.  This  information,  be  it  observed,</span><span>  is  to  be  supplied  by  the  collector,  and</span><span>  it  will  easily  be  understood  how  want  of</span><span>  fidelity  or  care  on  Iiis  part  may  be  thc</span><span>  means  of  disfranchising  qualified  persons,</span><span>  and  of  enfranchising  those  who  have  no</span><span>  claim  to  vote.  It  is  true  that  any  persons</span><span>  omitted  by  the  collector  may  send</span><span>  in  his  claim  to  enrolment,  in  writing,  at</span><span>  any  time  before  the  10th  October,  but</span><span>  the  fear  is,  that  the  Government  having</span><span>  undertaken  the  duty  of  collecting  the</span><span>  names,  no  one  will  think  it  necessary  to</span></p> <p><span>  ascertain  whether  his  name  has  been</span><span>  placed  on  the  list  or  not.  It  is  apparent,</span><span>  therefore,  that  tlte  business  will  need</span><span>  closely  watching,  for,  unfortunately,  the</span><span>  police,  although  disqualified  from  voting,</span><span>  have  sometimes  very  strong  political</span><span>  predilections.  Such  persons,  the  ""  in-</span><span>  structions""  state,  the  Courts  should</span><span>  carefully  abstain  from  appointing  as  col-</span><span>  lectors  ;  but  the  greatest  care  that  may</span><span>  possibly  be  exercised  will  form  but  a</span><span>  poor  guarantee  to  the  public.  We</span></p> <p><span>  believe  the  collection  of  electors'names  in</span></p> <p><span>  this  manner  will  be  found  liable  to  great</span><span>  abuse,  and  that  without  some  organisa-</span><span>  tion  in  the  populous  electorates  a  great</span><span>  many  qualified  persons  will  be  missed  by</span><span>  the  collectors,  and  find  themselves  dis-1</span><span>  franchised  at  election  times.  However,</span><span>  thc  new  system  is  now  the  law  of  the</span><span>  land,  and  it  will  be  the  duty  of  every</span><span>  good  citizen  to  aid  in  making  it  as</span></p> <p><span>  effective  as  possible.  I</span></p> <p><span>  The  lists  once  prepared  must  be</span></p> <p><span>  handed  to  the  respective  clerks  of  petty  j</span><span>  sessions,  and  be  by  them  exhibited</span><span>  during  the  last  fourteen  days  of  Sep-</span><span>  tember.  During  the  succeeding  ten</span></p> <p><span>  days,  any  person  named  in  such  list  may  ,</span><span>  forward  a  written  objection  against  any</span><span>  other  person,  but  it  must  be  accompanied</span><span>  by  a  deposit  of  five  shillings,  which  on</span><span>  the  order  of  the  revision  court,  may  be</span><span>  appropriated  to  the  payment  of  costs  in</span><span>  the  event  of  the  objection  not  being</span><span>  sustained.  The  court  may  also  order</span><span>  the  payment  of  any  further  sum  by  way</span><span>  of  costs,  and  levy  for  the  amount  by  the</span><span>  ordinary  process.</span></p> <p><span>  The  revision  courts  must  be  held  be-</span><span>  tween  the  i  st  and  21  st  days  of  November,</span></p> <p><span>  and  due  notice  of  them  must  be  given  j</span><span>  in  the  local  newspapers  or  otherwise  '</span><span>  made  public.  The  proceedings  at  such  ?</span><span>  courts  do  not  materially  differ  from  those</span></p> <p><span>  under  the  late  Act.  All  names  on  the  I</span><span>  lists,  not  objected  to,  must  be  retained,</span><span>  and  in  thc  case  of  applications  in  writing</span><span>  from  individual  claimants,  ""  the  declara-  ¡</span><span>  ""  rion  contained  in  the  notice  of  claim</span><span>  ""  is  prima  .facie  evidence  of  the  qualifi</span><span>  ""  cation  claimed,  and  in  the  absence  of</span><span>  ""  any  valid  notified  objection,  entitles</span><span>  ""  the  claimant  to  be  inserted  in  the</span><span>  ""  lists.""

Thc  rule</span><span>  was  a  sound  one,  that  when  any  situation  in</span><span>  thc  public  service  was  to  ho  filled,  those  who</span></p> <p><span>  stood  next  in  thc  service  should  have  it,  if  I</span><span>  they  were  thoroughly  competent  to  perform</span><span>  thc  duties.  (Hear,  hear.)  He  held  that  it</span><span>  would  take  away  every  reason  for  good  con-</span><span>  duct,  if  the  gentlemen  in  thc  public  service</span><span>  could  not  look  forward  with  a  tolerable</span><span>  amount  of  conlideucc  to  promotion,  if  their</span><span>  efficient  service  justified  the  promotion.

The  truth</span><span>  seems  to  be  that  Mr.  LILLEY  had  occu-</span><span>  pied  the  position  of  a  leading  politician</span><span>  ?while  lacking  sonic  of  its  more</span><span>  important  qualifications,  and  thal  in</span><span>  consequence  thc  public  will  suffer  no</span><span>  appreciable  loss  by  his  withdrawal  from</span><span>  the  Legislature.

In</span><span>  the  mother  country,  elevation  to  the</span><span>  Judicial  Bench  has  been  ever  regarded  as</span><span>  the  well-earned  reward  of  lengthened</span><span>  public  services  ;  and  the  Legislature</span><span>  has  consequently  attracted  thc  most</span><span>  powerful  and  cultivated  intellects  lo  be</span><span>  found  in  Die  ranks  of  the  legal  profession.</span><span>  As  a  politician  Mr.  LILLEY  has  had  a</span><span>  lengthened  career,  and  if  he  has  failed</span><span>  to  attain  the  highest  success  as  a  public</span><span>  man,  it  cannot  be  denied  that  he  has</span><span>  I  done  yeoman  service  to  the  State.

In</span><span>  him,  therefore,  the  firmness  indispensable</span><span>  to  a  leader  has  often  borne  the  aspect</span><span>  of  caprice  and  obstinacy,  and  hence  he</span><span>  found  it  impracticable  to  drag  his  intel-</span><span>  ligent  followers  into  what  were,  even  lo</span><span>  himself,  unfathomed  depths.  No  leader</span><span>  of  an  Opposition  ever  had  a  better</span><span>  chance  of  success  dian  Mr.  Lt  LI  .LY  when,</span><span>  willi  a  majority  al  his  back,  he  first  con-</span><span>  fronted  the  PAI.MLR  administration  ;  and</span><span>  no  leader  ever  owed  his  failure  lo  a</span><span>  series  of  more  egregious  blunders  than</span><span>  did  Mr.  I.ti.t.KYou  that  oc&lt;xiston.  And</span><span>  when  failure  compelled  abdication,  a</span><span>  recriminatory  speech  converted  the  defeat</span><span>  of  his  followers  into  a  discreditable  tout,</span><span>  lt  is  but  just  to  add,  however,  that  his</span><span>  demeanour  since  that  remarkable  mistake</span><span>  has  been  unexceptionable,  and  that  his</span><span>  political  career  terminated  in  a  laudable</span><span>  and  successful  attempt  to  re-c.nile  the</span><span>  scattered  fragments  of  his  party,  and  to</span><span>  form  a  Liberal  administration  under  the</span><span>  leadership  of  his  formet  rival,  lt  is  true</span><span>  that  his  self-abnegation  was  assisted  by</span><span>  the  knowledge  that  he  was  about  to  be</span><span>  called  to  a  higher  sphere  of  duly.  Dut</span></p> <p><span>  Iiis  conduct  was  raised  above  suspicion</span><span>  by  the  circumstance  that  it  was  his  poli-</span><span>  tical  opponents  who  first  cleared  for  him</span><span>  an  avenue  to  the  judicial  bench.  Thc</span><span>  ermine  was  freely  at  his  disposal  before</span><span>  the  PALM  ¡cu  Ministry  succumbed,  and,</span><span>  had  Mr.  MAÇAI.ISI'KR  failed  to  grasp  the</span><span>  reins  of  power,  his  elevation  would  have</span><span>  in  no  way  been  endangered.  His  ap-</span><span>  pointment  will  therefore  secure  the  stamp</span><span>  of  public  approval,  and  »vc  are  persuaded</span><span>  the  universal  hope  is  that  Mr.  Justice</span><span>  Lu.i.KV  will  long  adorn  the  high  and</span><span>  honoured  position  to  which  he  has  been</span></p> <p><span>  called.</span></p> <p><span>  For  the  now  vacant  seat  in  the  Assem-</span><span>  bly  there  are  already  two  candidates.</span><span>  Both  belong  to  the  legal  profession,  and</span><span>  one-Mr.  GARRICK-hasjircviouslyoccu</span><span>  pied  a  seat  in  our  Legislature.

As  he  told  us  on  Thursday,  this</span><span>  is  his  third  and  final  visit.  It  would  be</span></p> <p><span>  idle  were  we  lo  pretend  any  very  ardent</span><span>  personal  attachment  to  his  EXCELLENCY.</span><span>  He  has  been  but  three  years  in  the</span><span>  colony.  He  has  been  amongst  us  but</span><span>  lluee  times.  And  Iiis  acquaintanceship,</span><span>  even  willi  most  of  our  leading  citizens,</span><span>  has  been  necessarily  slight  Warm</span><span>  affection  is  a  product  of  slow  growth,  and</span><span>  one  essential  to  its  existence  is  personal</span><span>  contact.  That,  in  the  case  of  the</span><span>  MARQUIS  OF  NORMANDY  and  tile  people</span><span>  of  Rockhampton,  circumstances  have</span><span>  prevented,  and  personally  they  only  know</span><span>  him  as  a  comparatively  new  arrival  in  the</span><span>  colony,  and  an  occasional  and  distin-</span><span>  guished  visitor,  whose  exalted  official</span><span>  posilion  forbids  intimacy,  and  willi  whom</span><span>  familiarity  is  impossible.  His  EXCEL-</span><span>  LENCY'S  noble  ancestry,  his  reputa-</span><span>  tion  as  an  English  politician,  Iiis</span><span>  individual  worth,  and  Iiis  discreet</span><span>  bearing  on  all  public  and  private</span><span>  occasions  have,  however,  placed  him</span><span>  very  high  in  thc  esteem  of  the  colonists,</span><span>  and  therefore  Iiis  premature  departure</span><span>  has  been  heard  of  with  general  regret.</span><span>  The  proverb  tells  us  thal  good  people  arc</span><span>  scarce,  and,  even  in  the  recollection  of</span><span>  the  nollie  MARQUIS'  predecessors,  we</span><span>  cannot  but  feel  that  among  future</span><span>  Governors  we  may  never  meet  his  like</span><span>  again.</span></p> <p><span>  But  it  is  as  thc  representative  of  our</span><span>  most  gracious  SOVEREIGN  that  His</span><span>  EXCELLENCY  has  the  greatest  claim  upon</span><span>  our  regard.  It  is  in  the  departure  of  an</span><span>  experienced,  impartial,  and  strictly  con</span><span>  si  itutional  governor  that  we  shall  sustain</span><span>  the  greatest  deprivation.  It  can  never</span><span>  bc  forgotten  that  when  his  EXCELLENCY</span><span>  landed  in  the  colony  our  political  affairs</span><span>  were  in  a  slate  of  chaos  ;  that  legisla-</span><span>  tion  was  impossible  through  the  viru-</span><span>  lence  of  contending  politicians;  that</span><span>  north  was  arrayed  against  south  ;  and  that</span><span>  a  dismemberment  of  thc  colony  appeared</span><span>  at  the  time  inevitable.  At  the  metro-</span></p> <p><span>  polis,  our  chief  centre  of  population,</span><span>  the  Ministry  of  the  day  were  intensely</span><span>  unpopular  ;  and  consequently  if  thc</span><span>  GOVERNOR  was  not  called  upon  lo  dis-</span><span>  trust  the  counsel  of  Iiis  constitutional</span></p> <p><span>  advisers,  he  could  not  accept  it  without</span><span>  incurring  heavy  responsibilities.  The</span><span>  circumstances  were  peculiarly  trying,</span><span>  and  when  the  newly  arrived  GOVERNOR</span><span>  found  parly  feeling  run  so  strong  that  the</span><span>  citizens  of  Brisbane  refused  lo  join  the</span><span>  Government  of  the  colony  in  a  loyal</span><span>  demonstration,  the  effect  must  have  been</span><span>  most  chilling.  The  fact  that  the  munici-</span><span>  pal  authorities  pulled  down  the  triumphal</span><span>  arches  erected  by  the  Government  was,</span><span>  however,  one  of  the  least  discouraging</span><span>  symptoms.  A  far  more  ominous  circum-</span><span>  stance  was  the  leaguing  together  of  cx</span><span>  Ministers  of  the  Crown  and  aspirants</span><span>  to  tile  Supreme  Court  Bench  in  a</span><span>  factious  alliance  to  maintain  the  repre-</span><span>  sentative  chamber  of  the  Legislature  in</span></p> <p><span>  a  condition  of  dead-lock.  If  these</span></p> <p><span>  energetic  measures  of  obstruction  did</span><span>  not  assume  the  appearance  of  sedition</span><span>  rather  than  legitimate  political  agitation,</span><span>  it  must  be  conceded  that  to  an  English</span><span>  politician  just  arriving  from  the  birth-</span><span>  place  of  modern  constitutional  govern-</span><span>  ment,  the  distinction  between  sedition</span><span>  and  legitimate  party  action  must</span><span>  have  seemed  to  be  very  finely</span><span>  drawn.  The  occasion  was  a  very</span><span>  anxious  one,  and  the  new  GOVERNOR</span><span>  must  have  felt  that  no  ordinary  dangers</span><span>  and  pitfalls  beset  his  path.</span></p> <p><span>  A  less  experienced  politician  might</span><span>  have  been  tempted  to  arbitrate  between</span><span>  the  contending  factions,  and  to  trust  that</span><span>  by  his  interference  the  combatants</span><span>  would,  if  they  coulds  not  entirely  cease</span><span>  hostilities,  be  at  least  induced  to  ""  fight</span><span>  fair.""  Bul  Governor  NORMANDY,  by</span><span>  his  action,  evinced  a  thorough  appre-</span><span>  ciation  of  the  evil  of  meddle-</span><span>  someness.  He  started  with  thc  assump-</span><span>  tion  that  the  people  of  Queensland  were</span><span>  living  under  representative  institutions,</span><span>  and  that  all  the  grievances  complained</span><span>  of  must  be  redressed  by  constitutional</span><span>  means,  and  by  such  alone.  He  there-</span><span>  fore  remained  an  apparently  listless  and</span><span>  unimpassioned  spectator  of  the  struggle.</span><span>  He  let  matters  take  their  course,  until</span><span>  appealed  to  by  a  parry  who,  while  ad-</span><span>  mitting  themselves  the  minority  in  thc</span><span>  Legislature,  declared  that  they  were  thc</span><span>  representatives  °f  lne  majority  outside.</span><span>  As  such  representatives  they  addressed</span><span>  his  EXCELLENCY  by  a  written  memo-</span><span>  randum,  declaring  their  want  of  con-</span><span>  fidence  in  his  constitutional  advisers.</span><span>  Here  was  a  dilemma  out  of  which  a  less</span><span>  capable  Governor  than  Lord  NORMANDY</span><span>  would  have  found  extrication  difficult.</span><span>  Dut  he  treated  the  appeal  with  at  least</span><span>  assumed  indifference.  Iii  thc  first  place</span><span>  he,  as  Ht:u  MAJESTY'S  representative,</span><span>  knew  nothing  of  thc  Parliamentary  few</span><span>  who  rcpresenlcd  the  outside  majority  ;</span><span>  ami,  secondly,  he  never  yet  knew  a</span><span>  Ministry  to  enjoy  the  confidence</span><span>  of  thc  Opposition.  This  reply  was</span><span>  quaintly  pul,  bul  in  such  a  way  as  no</span><span>  longer  to  admit  of  argument,  lt  turned</span><span>  the  famous  ""  key  lo  the  position,""  and</span><span>  pul  the  Ministry  of  the  day  in  full  com-</span><span>  mand  of  the  parliamentary  fortress,  lt</span><span>  removed  the  drag-chain  from  the  wheels</span><span>  of  the  slate  coach,  and  permitted  its</span><span>  veteran  driver  to  again  direct  it  in  the</span><span>  path  of  progress.  ll  is  trite  thal</span><span>  attempts  at  obstruction  were  afterwards</span><span>  renewed,  but  ""  the  representatives  of</span><span>  the  people  outside""  found  themselves</span><span>  divided  and  utterly  incapable  of  main-</span><span>  taining  the  conflict.  Their  SAMSON  was</span><span>  shorn  of  his  locks,  and  he  himself</span><span>  received  intimation  that  he  no  longer</span><span>  enjoyed  the  confidence  of  his  ona</span><span>  followers.  Thus  the  Opposition  soon</span><span>  cnmibled  away,  and  the  members  of  our</span><span>  representative  chamber  were  taught  a</span><span>  wholesome  lesson.  There  is  not</span></p> <p><span>  likely  to  be  a  dead-lock  again,</span><span>  at  any  rate  between  opposing  par-</span><span>  lies  in  the  same  House;  and  it  may</span><span>  be  also  hoped  that  no  such  misfortune</span><span>  will  ever  occur  between  the  two  chambers.</span><span>  That  differences  of  a  serious  character</span><span>  will  arise  there  is  only  lo  much  reason</span><span>  to  dread,  but  it  may  be  hoped  that  there</span><span>  is  enough  patriotism  among  our  public</span><span>  men  to  prevent  a  repetition  in  any  form</span><span>  of  the  evils  arising  from  so  unjustifiable</span><span>  a  departure  from  constitutional  practice.</span></p> <p><span>  In  thus  referring  to  the  conflicts  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  past,  we  have  no  desire  to  rekindle  old  *</span><span>  animosities.  But  in  simple  justice  to  our  j</span><span>  departing  GOVERNOR,  we  are  bound  to</span><span>  contrast'""thc  peace  and  contentment  of</span><span>  the  present  with  the  hostilities  and  violent</span><span>  party  feeling  of  former  years.  His  EX-</span><span>  CELLENCY,  immediately  after  taking  the</span><span>  oaths  of  office,  was  called  upon  to  act</span><span>  entirely  upon  his  own  discretion.  There</span><span>  was  not  a  man  in  the  colony  to  whom  he</span><span>  could  look  for  advice.  There  was  the</span><span>  recommendation  of  his  responsible  ad-</span><span>  visers,  no  doubt,  but  it  became  his  duty</span><span>  to  decide  whether  they  were,  as  alleged,</span><span>  mere  usurpers  of  power,  and  deserving</span><span>  of  ignominious  dismissal.  The  current</span><span>  of  public  opinion  in  thc  southern  part  of</span><span>  the  colony  had  already  pronounced  in  the</span><span>  affirmative,  and  the  Press  were  almost</span><span>  unanimous  abettors  of  the  ""  Liberal</span><span>  Opposition.""  His  EXCELLENCY'S  de-</span><span>  cision  proved  correct,  but  in  the  then</span><span>  attitude  of  parties  he  must  have  watched</span><span>  its  effect  will)  deep  anxiety.  Now  every-</span><span>  one  admits  the  propriety  of  the  course</span><span>  taken,  for  ""  nothing  succeeds  like</span><span>  success.""  But,  it  is  a  fact,  nevertheless,</span><span>  that  at  thc  lime  alluded  lo  there  were</span></p> <p><span>  confident  predictions  of  his  EXCEL-</span><span>  LENCY'S  early  recall.  Instead,  he  has</span><span>  been  rewarded  with  promotion,  and  never</span><span>  was  reward  more  justly  earned.</span></p> <p><span>  The  public  of  the  colony  owe  a  debt</span><span>  of  gratitude  to  the  Marquis  of  NOR-</span><span>  MANDY,  and  we  are  glad  to  observe  that</span><span>  even  in  thc  metropolis  this  conviction  is</span><span>  rapidly  gaining  ground,  and  that  his</span><span>  EXCELLENCY,  if  not  quite  a  popular</span><span>  Governor,  is  one  almost  universally</span><span>  respected  and  esteemed.  In  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  he  has  always  been  highly</span><span>  appreciated,  and  the  reception  given  on</span><span>  this  his  farewell  visit  cannot  have  been</span><span>  otherwise  than  gratifying.  His  EXCEL-</span><span>  LENCY  departs  this  morning  willi  tho</span><span>  best  wishes  of  all  classes  amongst  us.</span><span>  That  he  may  have  a  long  and  prosperous</span><span>  career  is,  we  are  persuaded,  the  heartfelt</span><span>  desire  of  thousands  of  residents  in  this</span><span>  part  of  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  visit  of  the  PREMIER  to  Rock-</span></p> <p><span>  hampton  can  liardly  fail  to  &e  productive</span><span>  of  good.  He  came  here  as  the  head  of</span><span>  the  Government,  il  is  true,  bul  also  as</span><span>  the  leader  pf  a  political  party  which  has</span><span>  been  uniformly  unfriendly  towards  the</span></p> <p><span>  central  and  northern  districts  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  colony  ;  and  tile  honorable  gentleman</span><span>  was  personally  unpopular,-so  much  sa,</span><span>  indeed,  that  at  one  time  rudeness  was</span><span>  deemed  necessary  lo  vindicate  thc  con-</span><span>  sistency  of  the  town,  and  to  mark  the</span><span>  resentment  felt  for  past  injuries.  Hut,</span><span>  happily,  on  reconsideration,  more  worthy</span><span>  counsels  prevailed,  and  it  was  deter-</span><span>  mined  to  entertain  our  Ministerial  visitor</span><span>  with  becoming  cordiality.  This  deter-</span><span>  mination  once  arrived  at,  our  leading</span></p> <p><span>  citizens  treated  Mr.  MACALISTER  as</span></p> <p><span>  their  guest,  and  a  stranger  would</span><span>  have  found  it  difficult  to  discern  even  a</span><span>  trace  of  party  feeling  in  their  deport-</span><span>  ment  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  due  to</span><span>  the  PREMIER  to  say  that  he  also  waived</span><span>  personal  and  political  differences,  and</span><span>  accepted  the  attentions  of  his  entertainers</span><span>  with  perfect  good  feeling.  Thus  a  truce</span><span>  was  not  only  declared,  but  possibly  the</span><span>  foundation  of  a  better  understanding  in</span><span>  future  was  laid.  If  Mr.  MACALISTER</span><span>  has  not  felt  called  upon  to  confess</span><span>  penitence  for  past  neglect,  our  citizens</span><span>  have  equally  avoided  committing  them-</span><span>  selves  to  any  ratification  of  the</span><span>  Ministerial  policy,  past,  present,  or</span><span>  future.  There  is  the  mutual  understand-</span><span>  ing  that  we  shall  agree  to  differ,  and  thal</span><span>  we  shall  give  support  to  any  Administra-</span><span>  tion  which  shows  itself  capable  and</span><span>  desirous  of  meting  out  equal  justice  to</span><span>  all  parts  of  the  colony.  Still  there  is</span><span>  reason  to  believe  that  Mr.  MACALISTER</span><span>  has  been  gratified  with  the  progress  of</span><span>  the  town  and  the  energy  of  ¡ls  inhabilan  ts  ;</span><span>  and  probably,  among  other  facts,</span><span>  he  has  discovered  that  wc  are  not</span><span>  undeserving  of  some  attention  from</span><span>  he  Government.  He  has  found  that</span></p> <p><span>  _  a  community  we  are  characterised  by</span><span>  singular  unanimity  in  public  matters,</span><span>  and  that  we  are  not  unacquainted  with</span><span>  the  duties  and  privileges  appertaining  to</span><span>  citizens  of  a  free  and  prosperous  country.</span><span>  He  has  not  been  bored  by  money</span><span>  begging  deputations,  and  he  tells  us  that</span></p> <p><span>  such  as  did  wait  upon  him  have  departed  ;</span><span>  ""perfectly  satisfied.""  Perhaps  we  may</span><span>  infer  that  the  satisfaction  is  mutual,</span><span>  although  it  has  not  transpired  that  our</span><span>  guest  has  made  a  single  promise  beyond</span><span>  the  perfectly  safe  one  thal  all  matters</span><span>  laid  before  him  shall  receive  ""  careful</span><span>  consideration.""  Our  hope  is,  however,</span><span>  thal  a  renewed  personal  acquaintance</span><span>  with  the  town,  its  prospects  and  its</span><span>  wants,  will  enable  Mr.  MACALISTER  lo</span><span>  judge  of  the  reasonableness  or  otherwise</span><span>  of  fuñiré  applications.  We  are  not</span><span>  likely  hereafter  to  bc  told,  at  any  rate,</span><span>  that  Rockhampton  has  fallen  to  thc</span><span>  position  of  a  third  or  fourth  rate  town,</span><span>  or  that  it  has  been  pampered  by  unjusti-</span><span>  fiable  government  expenditure.  Mr.</span><span>  MACALISTER  has  failed  to  discern  thc</span><span>  evidence  of  that  extravagant  outlay  which</span><span>  his  party  declare  has  been  lavished  upon</span><span>  our  district,  for  the  very  simple  reason</span></p> <p><span>  that  no  such  evidence  exists.  Thc  ex-</span></p> <p><span>  penditure  which  figures  so  largely  in</span><span>  official  returns  has  been  upon  thc</span><span>  Northern  Railway,  and  thc  Government</span><span>  have  «Teated  a  valuable  asset  from  which</span><span>  the  Treasury  will  soon  derive  a  large</span><span>  revenue.

Tlie  designation  of  the</span><span>  Company  is  somewhat  less  pretentious</span><span>  than  was  at  first  suggested,  but  the</span><span>  change,  wc  think,  will  generally  be</span><span>  deemed  an  improvement  In  fact,  the</span><span>  effort  is  and  professes  to  be  a  modest</span><span>  one.  It  does  not  contemplate  taking</span><span>  the  colony  by  storm,  or  provoking</span><span>  active  opposition  from  the  A.S.N.</span><span>  Company.  It  seeks  to  provide  steam-</span><span>  boats  for  a  trade  which  that  Company</span><span>  does  not  deem  worth  cultivating,  and</span><span>  consequently  no  feeling  of  antagonism</span><span>  ought  to  be  created  when  the  little</span><span>  vessels  of  the  new  Company  make  their</span><span>  appearance  in  our  waters.  There  is  no</span><span>  desire,  we  believe,  on  the  part  of  the</span><span>  promoters  to  take  up  an  aggressive</span><span>  attitude  towards  the  A.S.N.  Company.</span><span>  It  is  held  that  the  want  of  means  of</span></p> <p><span>  shipping  cargo  to  the  northern  ports  is  a</span><span>  grievous  injury  to  the  mercantile  com-</span><span>  munity  here.  So  far  as  steam  communi-</span><span>  cation  is  concerned,  our  merchants  are</span><span>  absolutely  cut  off  from  all  the  ports  north</span><span>  of  Bowen,  and  to  restore  that  com-</span><span>  munication  is  the  primary  object  of  the</span><span>  Northern  Steamboat  Company.  It  is,</span><span>  therefore,  simply  a  defensive  movement,</span><span>  and  as  such  ought  not  to  provoke</span><span>  hostility.  .</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  unnecessary  for  us  to  occupy</span><span>  space  to-day  in  pointing  out  the</span><span>  advantages  the  proposed  Company  is</span><span>  likely  to  confer,  both  upon  Rockhampton</span><span>  and  the  ports  farther  north.  The  pro-</span><span>  spectus  will  be  found  to  supply  con-</span><span>  clusive  arguments  on  that  matter  ;</span><span>  indeed,  no  business  man  ought  to</span><span>  to  need  instruction  on  a  subject</span><span>  in  winch  he  is  so  deeply  interested.  But</span><span>  others  amongst  us  have  also  an  impor-</span><span>  tant  indirect  interest  in  the  question  of</span><span>  steam  communication  with  the  north.</span><span>  The  more  the  trade  of  Rockhampton</span><span>  expands,  thc  greater  will  be  thc  value  of</span><span>  its  warehouses,  shops,  and  business  sites.</span><span>  If,  therefore,  our  property-holders  per-</span><span>  ceive  their  true  interests,  they  will  not</span><span>  only  wish  success  to  the  movement  to</span><span>  establish  the  new  company,  but  also  take</span><span>  care  that  their  names  appear  on  the  list</span><span>  of  shareholders.  The  capital  needed  is</span><span>  not  great,  and  if  all  join,  the  amount</span><span>  required  from  each  shareholder  will  not</span><span>  press  heavily  on  any.  Of  course,  we</span><span>  assume  that  all  engaged  in  trade</span><span>  will  do  their  best,  and  not  expect  out-</span><span>  siders  to  do  everything  for  them.</span><span>  The  gentlemen  present  at  yesterday's</span><span>  meeting  did  not  shirk  their  responsi-</span><span>  bilities  in  this  matter,  at  any  rate,  and</span><span>  we  hope  those  traders  who  were  not  in</span><span>  attendance,  will  show  their  sympathy</span><span>  with  the  movement  in  a  practical  shape.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have,  however,  no  intention  to</span><span>  make  an  ad  miscricordiam  appeal  on</span><span>  behalf  of  the  new  Company.  If  well</span><span>  managed,  it  can  hardly  fail  to  prove  a</span><span>  financial  success,  and  we  think  that,  on</span><span>  glancing  at  fhe  names  on  the  provisional</span><span>  board,  the  most  fastidious  person  might</span><span>  select  some  half-dozen  directors  whose</span></p> <p><span>  j  presence  is  a  tolerably  good  guarantee</span></p> <p><span>  for  effective  management.  The  necessity</span><span>  for  the  formation  of  a  company  at  all,</span><span>  vre  take  it,  is  found  in  the  circumstance</span><span>  t'tiat  the  placing  of  a  merchant's  name</span><span>  on  the  share  list  gives  him  a  direct</span><span>  personal  interest  in  assisting  to  provide</span><span>  cargo  for  the  Company's  boats  ;  and  if,</span><span>  as  we  hope,  the  business  men  of  all  the</span><span>  northern  ports  can  be  induced  to  join  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  venture,  the  Northern  Steamboat</span></p> <p><span>  Company  cannot  fail  to  be  a  complete</span></p> <p><span>  success.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  lion.  thc  Premier,  tho  Courier  under-</span><span>  stands,  denied  himself  the  delights  of  tho  hall</span><span>  at  Townsville,  given  to  celebrate  His  Excel-</span><span>  lency's  visit,  and  set  out  adventurously  to  visit</span><span>  Charters  Towers  and  thc  adjoining  gold-fields.</span><span>  So  much  zeal  is  worthy  of  record,  and  in</span><span>  fu  ture  Mr.  Macalister  will  be  able  to  speak</span><span>  wi  th  inore  authority  concerning  our  northern</span><span>  gold-fields.</span></p> <p><span>  'TIIE  ""(iracio  Anglo-American  Oompany  of</span><span>  Minstrels  and  fiyninasts""  arrived  by  the</span><span>  Ti  nonee  from  tho  north  on  Tuesday.

At  first  sight  it  may  seem</span><span>  presumptuous  for  a  small  community  like</span><span>  ours  to  attempt  the  establishment  of  a</span><span>  local  steam  navigation  company.  Bris-</span><span>  bane,  the  capital  of  the  colony,  recently</span><span>  made  a  similar  attempt  and  failed,  it  is</span><span>  true  ;  but  the  causes  of  failure  are</span><span>  manifold  and  various,  and  when  fairly</span><span>  looked  at  do  not  supply  ground  for</span><span>  despairing  of  a  more  satisfactory  result</span></p> <p><span>  here.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  first  place  it  was  proposed  to</span><span>  purchase  four  suitable  steamboats,</span><span>  specially  constructed  for  the  trade,  and</span><span>  furnished  with  compound  engines  and</span><span>  all  the  latest  improvements.  In  the</span><span>  nature  of  things  this  would  have  caused</span><span>  great  delay,  and  two  years  would  have</span><span>  elapsed  before  the  Company  could</span><span>  have  been  in  the  position  to  commence</span><span>  operations.  Two  years  is  a  long  time</span><span>  to  look  forward  to  in  this  colony,  and</span><span>  the  merchants  who  saw  their  goods  shut</span><span>  out  by  every  steamer  naturally  felt  dis-</span><span>  couraged  by  the  proposal.  ""  In  two  years</span><span>  hence,""  they  argued,  ""circumstances  may</span><span>  have  altogether  changed,  and  what  shall</span><span>  wc  do  in  thc  meantime  ?  Unless  some-</span><span>  thing  be  done  immediately,  Sydney  and</span><span>  Melbourne  will  grasp  at  our  expanding</span><span>  northern  trade,  will  know  their  customers,</span><span>  and  will  have  formed  such  connexions  as</span><span>  it  will  bc  difficult  to  sunder  in  favour  ol</span><span>  new  competitors,  even  though  they  hai!</span><span>  from  the  capital  of  the  colony.  It  ii</span><span>  not  relief  two  years  hence  that  we  seek</span><span>  but  relief  now.  If  the  proposed  com</span><span>  pany  is  to  do  us  any  good  at  all,  it  mus</span><span>  be  done  immediately.""  The  force  of  thii</span><span>  reasoning  was  at  once  seen,  and  th«</span><span>  provisional  directors  found  it  necessary</span><span>  to  announce  their  intention  to  charte!</span><span>  boats,  in  order  to  commence  business  a</span><span>  once.  That  would  have  been  a  ven</span><span>  sensible  determination,  had  it  no</span><span>  unfortunately  proved  impracticable</span><span>  Only  two  vessels  were  to  be  procured</span><span>  and  neither  was  suitable  for  the  trade</span><span>  One  was  disliked  by  passengers  as  slow</span><span>  and  she  drew  too  much  water  for  severa</span><span>  of  the  northern  ports  with  which  it  wa</span><span>  desired  to  trade.  The  other  was  not  de</span><span>  ficient  in  speed,  but  she  was  objection</span><span>  able  as  a  great  coal-eater,  and  i</span><span>  employed  to  go  as  far  north  as  Cooktown</span><span>  would  have  had  no  storage  capacity  fo</span><span>  cargo.  These  boats,  therefore,  toidi</span><span>  not  be  availed  of  with  any  reasonabl</span></p> <p><span>  prospect  of  success,  and  the  new  com-</span><span>  pany  could  not  afford  to  damage  their</span><span>  prestige  by  starting  an  inefficient  andunre</span><span>  tnunerative  interim  service.  The  proposal</span><span>  to  begin  with  chartered  boats  consequently</span><span>  fell  through.  This  result  only  showed</span><span>  the  futility  of  the  movement,  and  aroused</span><span>  the  suspicion  that  the  promot.-rs  of  the</span><span>  company  had  launched  their  project</span><span>  without  first  connting  its  cost  The  pro-</span><span>  moters  struggled  on  for  a  time,  but  the</span><span>  scheme  really  broke  down  when  it  was</span><span>  found  impossible  to  charterboats.</span></p> <p><span>  There  were,  however,  other  causes  of</span><span>  non-success.  The  A.S.N.  Company,  with</span><span>  the  true  instinct  of  self-preservation,  made</span><span>  prodigious  efforts  to  conciliate  the</span><span>  Brisbane  merchants.  They  offered  to</span><span>  run  steamers  fortnightly  from  Brisbane</span><span>  to  Cooktown,  and  to  make  Brisbane  one</span><span>  of  the  termini,  if  the  Government  would</span><span>  only  give  them  a  reasonable  subsidy  for</span><span>  mail  conveyance.  Here  was  a  sub-</span><span>  stantial  advantage,  and  the  metropolitan</span><span>  merchants,  who  are  wise  in  their  genera-</span><span>  tion,  influenced  the  Government  in  favour</span><span>  of  the  proposal.  They  reasoned  that  a</span><span>  local  steam  navigation  company  might</span><span>  be  a  very  good  thing  two  years  hence,</span><span>  but  a  fortnightlyservice  with  commodious</span><span>  boats  to  Cooktown  was  a  much  better</span></p> <p><span>  thing  now.  The  Company's  offer  was</span><span>  consequently  accepted  by  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  and  the  promoters  of  the  Northern</span><span>  Steam  Navigation  Company  no  doubt</span><span>  accepted  their  defeat  with  resignation.</span><span>  They  had  got  less  than  they  asked,  but</span><span>  far  more  than  they  had  hoped,  for</span><span>  facilities  for  northern  trade  had  been</span></p> <p><span>  provided  for  them  at  the  public</span><span>  expense,  and  they  could  henceforward</span><span>  ship  by  the  mail  boats,  or  take  advantage</span><span>  of  any  stray  opportunity  that  might  offer,</span><span>  without  the  slightest  risk  of  a  depre-</span><span>  ciated  share  list.  And  when  the  A.S.N.</span></p> <p><span>  Company  conferred  the  additional  boon  j</span><span>  of  placing  the  Black  Swan  regularly</span></p> <p><span>  on  the  line  between  Brisbane  and</span></p> <p><span>  Mackay,  it  was  naturally  felt  that  every</span><span>  concession  that  could  be  reasonably,</span><span>  sought  had  been  made.</span></p> <p><span>  To  the  merchants  of  Rockhampton,</span></p> <p><span>  in  a  different  light.  They  discovered  in</span><span>  them  a  design  to  rob  them  of  their</span><span>  northern  trade,  and  to  alienate  them</span><span>  from  customers  who  would  certainly</span><span>  have  given  them  a  slight  preference.</span><span>  To  the  northern  people  it  was  imma-</span><span>  terial  whether  their  goods  came  from</span><span>  Brisbane  or  Rockhampton.  Their  desire</span><span>  was  the  cheapest  market.  But  there  were</span><span>  collateral  considerations  in  favour  of</span></p> <p><span>  Brisbane.  It  was  the  larger  market,  and</span></p> <p><span>  it  was  the  seat  of  Government.  These</span><span>  two  considerations  reconciled  them  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  change,  and  induced  them  to  approve</span><span>  of  the  public  money  being  devoted  to</span><span>  subsidising  vessels  to  pass  our  port.  The</span><span>  new  contract  consequently  gave  satis-</span><span>  faction,  both  to  north  and  south,  and</span><span>  noone  complained  except  the  ""discon-</span><span>  tented  people  of  the  Great  Central</span><span>  Division.""</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  plain  that  we  cannot  look  to  the</span><span>  Government  for  any  complete  redress  of</span><span>  our  -  grievance  in  this  respect,  and  it</span><span>  therefore  becomes  a  question  whether</span><span>  our  traders  shall  sit  contentedly  down</span><span>  while  business  drifts  away  from  them.</span><span>  Of  course-if,  after  due  consideration,  no-</span><span>  thing  can  be  done,  we  must  accept  the</span><span>  inevitable.  But  it  does  really  appear  as</span><span>  though  fortune  were  about  to  befriend  us</span><span>  in  an  unexpected  manner.  Two  of  our</span><span>  local  firms  have,  in  fact,  already  taken</span><span>  steps  to  meet  the  requirements</span><span>  of  the  port,  and  it  is  some-</span><span>  what  remarkable  that  each,  acting  inde-</span><span>  pendently  of  the  other,  lias  arranged</span><span>  for  placing  upon  our  river  a  new  steam-</span></p> <p><span>  boat  of  about  one  hundred  tons  burden.</span><span>  The  Messrs.  THOMSON  have  procured</span><span>  theirs  from  England,  and  she  (the  Norse-</span><span>  man)  is  expected  to  arrive  in  about  a</span></p> <p><span>  month.  She  is  fitted  with  compound</span><span>  engines,  steam  winch,  etc.,  and  was</span><span>  built,  we  understand,  specially  for  this</span><span>  port.  Messrs.  HUNTER  and  Co.'s</span><span>  steamer  is  being  built  in  Sydney,  and</span><span>  ?will  be  equipped  similarly  to  the  Norse-</span><span>  man.  These  vessels  will  be  both  good</span><span>  sea  boats,  and  while  possessing  consider-</span><span>  able  power,  will  be  small  consumers  of</span><span>  coal.  They  will  be  quite  equal  to  the</span><span>  trip  to  Cooktown  and  back,  and  being</span><span>  worked  at  little  more  expense  than  a</span><span>  schooner,  will  be  able  to  carry  cargo  at</span><span>  moderate  rates  of  freight.  Being  of</span><span>  light  draught,  they  will  run  into  Broad</span><span>  sound,  Mackay,  and  Ross'  Creek  at</span><span>  Townsville  with  great  facility.  They</span><span>  will,  it  is  believed,  navigate  the  placid</span><span>  waters  inside  the  Barrier  Reef  with  regu-</span><span>  larity,  and  make  quicker  trips  than  the</span><span>  Tinonee.  They  are  not  intended  to  carry</span><span>  passengers,  it  is  true,  but  will  probably</span><span>  afford  accommodation  quite  equal  to  that</span><span>  in  the  steerage  ofjthe  A.S.N.  Co.'s  vessels.</span><span>  The  question  then  arises,  Is  there  trade</span><span>  for  these  two  boats  in  the  event  of  their</span><span>  being  put  on?  We  have  made  inquiries</span><span>  amongst  those  who  ought  to  know,  and</span><span>  the  reply  is,  yes.  The  Tinonee,  it  is</span></p> <p><span>  argued,  is  often  obliged  to  shut  out  ;</span><span>  goods,  although  her  rates  of  freight  are</span></p> <p><span>  prohibitory,  and  although  she  seldom  :</span><span>  goes  beyond  Mackay.  Transhipments</span></p> <p><span>  from  southern  steamers  are  ol  course  .</span></p> <p><span>  provided  for  first,  and  the  local  merchant  !</span><span>  has  not  only  to  contend  against  high</span><span>  freights,  but  also  to  take  the  chance  of</span><span>  getting  his  goods  away.  This  is  a  most</span><span>  humiliating  position,  and  it  must  be</span><span>  positively  destructive  to  trade.</span></p> <p><span>  We  are  assured  that  were  regular</span><span>  communication  established  between</span><span>  Rockhampton  and  the  northern  ports,  at</span><span>  moderate  rates  of  freight,  a  good  trade</span></p> <p><span>  could  at  once  be  done.  In  the  matter  of</span></p> <p><span>  flour  and  Tasmanian  produce,for  example,</span><span>  our  traders  can  do  business  just  as</span><span>  -well  as  Brisbane  or  Sydney.  We  import</span><span>  from  Adelaide  and  Hobart  Town,  and</span><span>  can  re-export  on  just  as  good  terms</span><span>  as  the  Sydney  or  Brisbane  people,  and</span><span>  .we  have  the  important  advantage  of  being</span><span>  geographically  within  half  the  distance  of</span><span>  Brisbane,  a  consideration  of  great  im-</span><span>  portance  in  dealing  with  perishable</span><span>  goods.  Again,  there  is  a  good  trade  to</span><span>  be  done  with  Cooktown,  in  live</span></p> <p><span>  j  stock.  No  port  in  Queensland  is  so</span><span>  j  favourably  situated  as  Rockhampton</span><span>  j  for  exporting  fat  sheep,  and  the</span><span>  '  Cooktown  people  will  not  always  be</span></p> <p><span>  content  with  beef.  Already,  consider-</span><span>  able  numbers  of  both  sheep  and  horses</span><span>  have  been  shipped  here  for  the  north,</span><span>  and  business  of  this  nature  has  only  been</span><span>  limited  by  the  want  of  proper  means  of</span><span>  conveyance.  In  general  merchandise,</span><span>  too,  lhere  is  a  trade  to  be  done,  as  is</span><span>  proven  by  the  large  shipments  made  and</span><span>  cargo  shut  out  by  the  Tinonee.  These</span><span>  are  facts,  which  are  worth  bushels  of</span><span>  mere  arguments-such  as  that  ""  it  is  im-</span><span>  possible  for  Rockhampton  merchants  to</span><span>  compete  with  Brisbane  and  Sydney.""</span><span>  They  have  done  so  in  the  past  despite</span><span>  exorbitant  freights,  and  the  uncertainly</span><span>  and  inadequacy  of  means  of  communi-</span><span>  cation.  And  that  they  will  do  so  in  the</span><span>  future,  when  direct  importations  from</span><span>  England  enable  them  to  compete  in</span><span>  price  with  the  southern  merchants,  no</span><span>  one  who  looks  at  the  facts  impartially</span></p> <p><span>  can  doubt.</span></p> <p><span>  In  conclusion,  we  repeat  that  an</span><span>  opportunity  now  offers  to  the  business</span><span>  men  of  Rockhampton  which  it  is  of  the</span><span>  highest  importance  they  should  take</span><span>  advantage  of.  They  can,  by  concerted</span><span>  action,  provide  at  least  a  temporary</span><span>  service  with  the  northern  ports,  and  so</span><span>  lay  the  foundation  of  a  trade  whicli  must</span><span>  ere  long  assume  important  dimensions.</span><span>  The  owners  of  the  steamboats  proposed</span><span>  to  be  employed  are  themselves  deeply</span><span>  interested  in  the  matter,  and  may  be</span><span>  expected  to  join  heartily  in  the  venture.</span><span>  The  risk  need  not  be  great  at</span><span>  first,  and  the  trade  once  estab-</span><span>  lished  on  a  remunerative  footing,  there</span><span>  will  be  no  difficulty  in  raising  the</span><span>  capital  necessary  to  secure  first-class</span><span>  vessels.  If  all  join,  failure  is  impossible,</span><span>  and  we  shall  have  the  proud  satisfac-</span><span>  tion  of  showing  how  much  may  be</span><span>  accomplished  by  a  small  community</span><span>  whem  it  is  resolved  to  unite  as  one  man</span><span>  to  promote  the  common  weal.</span></p> <p><span>  SERMONS  on  behalf  of  the  Wesleyan  Mis-</span><span>  sionary  Society  will  be  preached  to-morrow</span><span>  (Sunday),  in  the  Kent-street  Wesleyan  Church,</span><span>  in  the  morning,  at  11,  by  the  Rev.

Years  ago</span><span>  a  Little  J'eddlington  spirit  permeated  all</span><span>  public  matters  at  Brisbane,  and  now  that</span><span>  the  eily  bas  in  many  respects  outgrown</span><span>  its  early  weaknesses,  the  old  taint  still</span></p> <p><span>  adheres  to  its  civic  institutions.  The</span></p> <p><span>  City  Council  is  a  bear-garden,  the  public</span><span>  streets  arc  disgracefully  kepi,  and  the</span><span>  character  of  the  Corporation  is  a  reproach</span><span>  to  the  citizens.  No  wonder  lli.il  in  such</span><span>  circumstances  all  hope  of  restoring  the</span><span>  reputation  of  the  Council  has  been</span><span>  abandoned,  or  that  relief  is  sought</span><span>  through  the  intervention  of  Parliament,</span><span>  and  the  reincorporation  of  the  city</span><span>  under  a  special  Act.</span></p> <p><span>  il  is  in  no  spirit  of  exultation  that  we</span><span>  write  thus  of  the  metropolitan  Counc  il.</span><span>  On  the  contrary,  we  observe  its  degrada-</span><span>  tion  with  genuine  reg.et.  Thc  example</span><span>  so  set  cannot  but  have  a  deteriorating</span><span>  effect  upon  municipal  institutions  in</span><span>  otherparlsofQueensl.md.  and  tend  tobring</span><span>  the  beneficent  principle  of  self-govern-</span><span>  ment,  upon  the  healthy  development  of</span><span>  which  thefulureprosperity  of  thecolony  is</span><span>  largely  dependent,  into  haired  and  con-</span><span>  tempt.  \Vhen,  as  occurred  at  the  recent</span><span>  election  of  mayor  al  Brisbane,  one</span><span>  alderman  was  permittee!  lo  make  a  bur-</span><span>  lesque  of  the  proceedings  by  a  disorderly</span></p> <p><span>  motion  to  the  effect  that  another  alder-</span></p> <p><span>  man  be  appointedchaplain  to  the  Council,</span><span>  and  when  a  disappointed  candidate  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  chair  was  allowed  lo  instill  the</span><span>  MAYOR  elect  with  impunity,  it  is  im-</span><span>  possible  not  lo  feel  that  in  a  measure  the</span><span>  whole  colony  is  disgraced  by  sucb  pro-</span><span>  ceedings.  Had  a  proper  feeling  existed</span><span>  amongst  thc  aldermen,  such  irregularities</span></p> <p><span>  would  not  have  been  tolerated  for  a</span><span>  moment,  and  such  men  as  Messrs.</span><span>  GRAYSON  and  BII.I.KIT  would  have  dis-</span><span>  covered  thal  the  taproom  and  not  the</span><span>  council  chamber  was  their  proper  sphere</span></p> <p><span>  of  action.</span></p> <p><span>  .Much  might  be  done  to  redeem  the</span><span>  civic  reputation  of  Brisbane,  were</span><span>  greater  public  spirit  displayed  by  the</span><span>  citizens.  lint  politics  alone  seem</span><span>  capable  of  exciting  the  people  of  the</span><span>  metropolis  to  energetic  action.  They</span><span>  are  ever  ready  to  hold  an  indignation</span><span>  meeting  to  denounce  a  ""  sipialting</span><span>  government,""  or  abuse  a  representative</span><span>  'who  bas  dared  to  vole  against  the</span><span>  popular  wish,  but  the  discreditable</span><span>  conduct  of  aldermen  is  always  deemed</span><span>  beneath  notice.  Il  is  naught  that  the</span><span>  city  rivals  Cologne  for  the  variety  and</span><span>  pungency  of  its  slinks,  or  that  lhere  is</span><span>  not  a  well-kept  gutter  within  the  whole</span><span>  civic  boundary,  lt  is  liol  in  such  matters</span><span>  that  thc  metropolitan  nose  scents  corrup-</span><span>  tion,  bul  in  the  circumstance  that</span><span>  Conservative  politicians  have  dared</span></p> <p><span>  to  exert  an  influence  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  legislation  of  the  country.  lt</span></p> <p><span>  would  be  far  more  creditable  lo  our</span></p> <p><span>  Brisbane  friends  if,  without  neglecting  to</span><span>  display  an  enlightened  interest  in  the  po-</span><span>  litical  affairs  of  the  colony,  they  would</span><span>  reserve  their  vials  of  oratorical  «Tath  for</span><span>  the  heads  of  their  civic  functionaries,</span><span>  whose  ill  conduct  and  incapacity</span><span>  threaten  to  not  only  make  shipwreck</span><span>  of  municipal  government,  but  also  en-</span><span>  danger  the  health  and  lives  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  citizens.</span></p> <p><span>  Of  course  il  would  be  unbecoming  to</span><span>  the  metropolitans  to  follow  (he  example</span><span>  of  the  second  (own  in  the  colony  in  any</span><span>  maller,  and  especially  so  in  dealing  with</span><span>  their  public  institutions.  Yet  we  may  he</span><span>  permitted  lo  suggest  lhai  a  leaf  or  two</span><span>  might  be  taken  out  of  our  book  willi</span><span>  great  advantage  1o  the  ciii/ens  of  Bris-</span><span>  bane.  If,  for  instance,  the  present  me-</span><span>  tropolitan  aldermen  could  be  induced  by</span><span>  the  pressure  of  public  opinion  to  resign</span><span>  in  a  body,  it  is  very  unlikely  (hal  an</span><span>  entirely  new  Council'  would  not  prove</span><span>  a  vast  improvement  on  any  Corporation</span><span>  thal  Brisbane  has  yet  been  blessed  willi.</span><span>  New  blood  cimwi  he  introduced  with</span><span>  advantage  where  there  has  been  a  loo</span><span>  free  admixture  of  had  blood,  and  hence</span><span>  the  nou-vecupei  alive  effect  of  the  ordi-</span><span>  nary  annual  elections.  But  once  stall</span><span>  willi  a  clean  sheet,  and  the  names  at-</span><span>  tached  lo  it  would  be  found  lo  represent</span><span>  men  not  only  of  purer  blood,  but  also</span><span>  of  vasily  improved  intellectual  and  moral</span><span>  perceptions  and  capacities.</span></p> <p><span>  ll  appears,  however,  thal  a  bill  for  the</span><span>  Incorporation  of  thc  City  of  Brisbane</span><span>  has  already  been  prepared,  and  will  be</span></p> <p><span>  submitted  to  Parliament  during  next</span><span>  session.  What  the  general  character  of</span><span>  this  measure  is  has  not  yet  transpired.  '</span><span>  Hut  it  contemplates  one  alteration  which</span><span>  can  hardly  fail  to  prove  beneficial.  It</span><span>  provides  that  the  MA  VOR  shall  be  elected</span><span>  by  the  general  body  of  ratepayers,</span><span>  instead  of  by  the  aldermen  from</span><span>  among  themselves.  After  the  recent</span><span>  display  al  Brisbane,  it  is  evidently  time</span><span>  that  some  change  of  the  kind  were  made  ;</span><span>  and  in  Rockhampton  circumstances</span><span>  have  occurred  which  indicate  that  even</span><span>  here  thc  present  mode  of  electing  the</span><span>  MAVOR  sometimes  furnishes  an  occasion</span><span>  for  undignified  intrigues  and  ill-concealed</span><span>  jealousies.  The  question  therefore  arises</span><span>  -Wily  is  a  special  bill  of  incorporation</span><span>  necessary  for  thc  metropolis  ?  and  why-</span><span>  not  extend  the  advantages  of  reform  to</span><span>  municipalities  generally  ?  This  inquiry,</span><span>  it  may  be  presumed,  will  be  pertinently</span><span>  suggested  in  thc  Legislature  when  thc</span><span>  Brisbane  Incorporation  Hill  comes  under</span><span>  consideration,  and  it  will  have  to  be</span><span>  conclusively  answered  before  the  measure</span><span>  is  permitted  to  become  law.</span></p> <p><span>  In  several  other  respects  the  municipal</span><span>  laws  of  thc  colony  are  in  need  of</span><span>  amendment.  This  was  fully  acknow-</span><span>  ledged  by  the  late  (  jovernment,  whose</span><span>  intention  il  was  to  introduce  an  amend-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  and  consolidating  measure  on  the</span><span>  first  good  opportunity.  Hut  for  sonic</span><span>  years  past  the  redistribution  question,</span><span>  and  the  factious  obstruction  offered  to  the</span><span>  late  Government,  prevented  legislation  on</span></p> <p><span>  so  comparatively  trifling  a  matter  as  muni-  j</span><span>  cipal  reform.  Happily  the  redistribution</span></p> <p><span>  question  is  now  disposed  of  for  a  time,  j</span><span>  and  factious  obstruction  is  a  thing</span><span>  of  the  ¡last  It  may  therefore  be  hoped</span><span>  that,  despite  the  declared  urgency  of</span><span>  land  legislation,  and  the  two  sets  of</span><span>  Estimates  requiring  lobe  dealt  with  next</span></p> <p><span>  session,  il  may  be  found  practicable  to  j</span><span>  secure  consideration  for  a  new  Munici-  j</span><span>  polities  Hill,  and  legislation  on  other  j</span><span>  important  subjects  of  domestic  reform,  j</span></p> <p><span>  'Chere  is  just  one  point  on  which  ;</span><span>  observation  wan-ants  us  in  pointing  out</span><span>  a  widely-spread  error.  The  practice  in</span><span>  this  colony  has  been  to  require  purely</span><span>  honorary  service  in  the  Mayoral  chair.</span></p> <p><span>  This  we  believe  to  be  one  cause  of  the</span><span>  general  inefficiency  of  municipal  govern-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  in  the  colony.  A  Mayor's  duties  ;</span><span>  are  onerous  and  constant.  The  honour  |</span><span>  attached  lo  the  office  is  certainly  a</span><span>  trifling  compensation,  but  docs  r.ot  out-</span><span>  weigh  the  discomfott  and  anxiety</span><span>  encountered  by  its  occupant.

FEBRUARY  25,  1874.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  meeting  convened  by  the  MAYOR</span><span>  for  this  afternoon  should  attract  a  good</span><span>  attendance  of  our  business  men.  As</span><span>  yet  the  project  of  a  new  Queensland</span><span>  Steam  Navigation  Company  is  in  the</span><span>  initial  stage,  and  the  plans  of  its  pro-</span><span>  moters  have  not  been  made  known</span><span>  probably  have  not  been  laid.  Thc  meet-</span><span>  ing  at  Brisbane  appears  to  have  been</span><span>  prompted  by  the  palpable  want  of</span><span>  steamboat  accommodation  between  the</span><span>  various  Queensland  porLs,  and  especially</span><span>  between  Brisbane  and  the  new  settle-</span><span>  ments  on  the  northern  coast.  It  is</span><span>  reported  that  one  thousand  lons  of  mer-</span><span>  chandize  are  lying  at  Brisbane  awaiting</span><span>  transit  northwards,  and  that  the  want  of</span><span>  steam  conveyance  is  seriously  crippling</span><span>  the  trade  of  thc  metropolis.  The</span><span>  A.  S.  N.  Company  secure  freightage  at</span><span>  Sydney  for  all  their  available  vessels,</span><span>  and  Brisbane  merchants  consequently</span><span>  find  their  goods  shut  out.  It  would  be</span><span>  unreasonable  to  expect  a  Sydney  steam-</span><span>  ship  company  to  cultivate  the  trade  of</span><span>  Brisbane  at  the  expense  of  their  own</span><span>  port,  and  if  a  sudden  expansion  through</span><span>  thc  Palmer  rush  makes  their  fleet  unequal</span><span>  to  the  demands  upon  it,  they  are  bound</span><span>  to  give  a  preference  to  the  interests  of</span><span>  their  own  shareholders.  The  circum-</span><span>  stance  that  several  large  sailing</span><span>  vessels  arc  loading  at  Sydney  for</span></p> <p><span>  I  the  Endeavour  River  goes  to  prove</span></p> <p><span>  the  insufficiency  of  steam  conveyance  ;</span><span>  and  the  probabilityis  that  thc  movemcntsof</span><span>  thc  southern  merchants  are  scarcely  less</span><span>  hampered  than  arc  those  of  their  con-</span><span>  temporaries  at  Brisbane.  The  A.  S.  N.</span><span>  Company  are  not  to  be  blamed  for  their</span><span>  inability  to  cope  with  thc  increased</span><span>  trade.  It  could  not  have  been  foreseen</span><span>  or  provided  against  without  entering</span><span>  upon  thc  region  of  speculative  ship-</span><span>  building.  Twelve  months  ago  the</span><span>  Company's  fleet  was  equal  to  .ill  ordinary</span><span>  requirements  of  the  trade.  If  many  of</span><span>  their  steamers  were  old,  while  nearly  all</span><span>  frere  insatiable  coal-caters,  they  were</span><span>  gradually  remodelling  and  converting</span><span>  them  into  good  economical  vessels  of  very</span><span>  respectable  speed,  even  in  these/lays  of</span><span>  rapid  steaming.  The  late  accident  to</span><span>  the  James  Paterson  occurred  at  an  un-</span><span>  fortunate  time,  and  has  greatly  compli-</span><span>  cated  the  Company's  arrangements.  So</span><span>  that,  if  our  merchants  find  trade  brought</span><span>  nearly  to  a  deadlock  through  insufficiency</span><span>  of  means  of  transit,  no  blame  is  attach-</span><span>  able  to  anyone  in  particular.  The</span><span>  simple  truth  appears  to  be  that  more</span><span>  coasting  steamers  must  be  procured,  and</span><span>  tile  question  lo  bc  solved  now  is  whether</span><span>  the  Queensland  trading  community  shall</span><span>  patiently  await  thc  movements  of  the</span><span>  A.  S.N.  Com]  ¡any,  or  pul  their  own</span></p> <p><span>  shoulders  to  the  wheel.</span></p> <p><span>  The  greatest  difficulty  in  thc  way  of</span><span>  establishing  a  second  Queensland  Steam</span><span>  Navigation  Company  is  thc  lamentable</span><span>  failure  which  resulted  from  the  opera-</span><span>  tions  of  the  first.  The  gauntlet  was</span><span>  thrown  down  to  ""  Old  Monopoly  ""</span><span>  twelve  years  ago,  and  the  Queenslanders</span><span>  trusting  to  their  government  subsidy</span><span>  were  confident  of  an  easy  victory.  The</span><span>  warfare  was  spirited  and  long-continued,</span><span>  and  although  the  older  Company  came</span><span>  triumphantly  out  of  the  struggle,  another</span><span>  such  victor)'  would  have  been  ruinous.</span><span>  Before  thc  collapse  of  the  Queenslander.1;,</span></p> <p><span>  A.  S.  N.  Company's  stock  had  receded</span><span>  far  below  par,  and  insolvency  loomed</span><span>  in  the  distance.  The  turning-point</span><span>  was  gained  when  the  Queensland</span><span>  boats  were  purchased  al  a  low  figure,</span><span>  and  began  to  run  under  the  Austral-</span><span>  asian  flag.  Since  that  time  the  Com-</span><span>  pany's  affairs  have  been  steadily  im-</span><span>  proving;  but  even  now,  after  several</span><span>  years'  command  of  the  Queensland</span><span>  trade,  it  has  barely  recovered  the  losses</span><span>  incurred  in  crushing  the  rival  company.</span></p> <p><span>  That  thc  operations  of  steamship  com-</span><span>  panies  are  not  necessarily  conducted  at</span><span>  a  loss  is  shown,  by  the  brokers'  ((nota-</span><span>  tions  of  steam  stocks.  The  A.  S.  N.</span><span>  Company's  shares  realise  par,  but  the</span><span>  Hunter  River  Company-its  successful</span><span>  competitor-is  in  a  much  better  position,</span><span>  for  its  £10  shares  are  quoted  at  ¿£13</span><span>  10s.  The  capital  of  the  latter  cornpany</span><span>  is  only  .£55,000,  and  it  has  been</span><span>  for  many  years  a  dividend-paying  con-</span><span>  cern,  despite  thc  severest  competition  of</span><span>  the  old  Company  in  time  past.  The</span><span>  Clarence  River  Company  made  heavy</span><span>  losses  rill  lately,  and  its  £10  shares</span><span>  fell  to  forty  shillings  ;  but  better  times</span><span>  have  dawned  upon  that  Company  also.</span><span>  At  thc  proprietors'  meeting,  held  on  the</span><span>  9th  instant,  thc  net  profits  of  the  half</span><span>  year  were  shown  to  have  been  .£2733,</span><span>  out  of  total  gross  earnings  of  ,£12,570.</span><span>  Ten  per  cent  dividend  was  then  dcclaed,</span><span>  and  .£1500  carried  to  reserve  fund.</span></p> <p><span>  These  facts  go  to  prove  that  there  is</span><span>  room  for  a  new  company  in  Queensland,</span><span>  and  that  with  good  management  il  would</span><span>  soon  become  a  dividend-paying  concern.</span><span>  If  formed  now  its  object  would  be  to</span><span>  undertake  business  which  the  A.  S.  N.</span><span>  Company  finds  itself  unable  to  do,  and</span><span>  therefore  it  possibly  might  escape  the</span><span>  uncompromising  opposition  manifested</span><span>  towards  the  late  Queensland  Company.</span><span>  Rivalry  of  course  there  would  be,  but</span><span>  even  thc  Directors  of  the  A.S.N.</span><span>  Company  must  admit  the  healthfulness</span><span>  of  competition  in  trade,  and  experience</span><span>  has  probably  taught  them  the  folly  of</span><span>  cut-throat  opposition.  There  would  be</span><span>  abundant  scope  for  both  companies,</span><span>  and  there  is  no  good  reason  why</span><span>  their  proceedings  should  not  be</span><span>  distinguished  by  honourable  rivalry,  such</span><span>  as  for  years  past  has  marked  the  compe-</span><span>  tition  of  the  A.  S.  N.  and  Hunter  River</span><span>  Companies.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  very  unlikely  that  any  important</span><span>  business  will,  be  transacted  at  to-day's</span><span>  meeting.  Hs  object  principally  is  to</span><span>  obtain  an  expression  of  public  opinion</span><span>  in  reference  to  the  projected  company.</span><span>  That  obtained,  further  steps  must  be</span><span>  deferred  until  the  plans  and  proposals  of</span><span>  thc  promoters  in  Brisbane  are  made</span></p> <p><span>  known.</span></p> ",Article,1874-02-25,"The Rockhampton Bulletin, WITH WHICH IS INCORPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER.

I</span><span>  Wc  learn  from  Mr.  Graham  Macdonald  that</span><span>  a  snip's  yard  drifted  ashore  on  thc  coast  at  his</span></p> <p><span>  station,  Balnagowan,  two  days  after  thc  recent  J</span><span>  heavy  gale.  It  is  about  thirty  feet  long,  sud</span><span>  has  ropes  attached,  also  two  chains,  one  block,</span><span>  ?nd  portions  of  a  sail  torn  into  shreds.  And</span><span>  on  Sunday  some  tracery  in  wood,  bealing  the</span><span>  emblem  of  a  wheat-sheaf  and  sickle,  washed</span><span>  ashore  only  a  short  distance  from  Mr.  Mac-</span><span>  donald's  house.  After  making  inquiries,  we</span></p> <p><span>  are  inclined  to  think  that  t!u  yard  is  the  fore-  :</span><span>  yard  of  a  steamer.  It  did  not  come  from  tho</span><span>  Landsborough,  os  the  spars  of  that  ship  were</span><span>  painted  buff  colour,  whilst  this  one  is  black  ;</span><span>  and  supposing  tho  Landsborough  to  bc</span><span>  wrecked,  thc  drifting  fragments  from  her  course</span><span>  would  not  be  likely  to  reach  the  mainland.  We</span><span>  cannot  identify  tho  wheat-sheaf  tracing  but</span><span>  possibly  some  of  our  readers  may  be  able  to</span><span>  throw  light  upon  tho  subject.

So</span><span>  that,  on  the  whole,  thc  appointments  may</span><span>  bc  deemed  to  supply  guarantees  for  an</span><span>  impartial  and  comprehensive  inquiry.</span></p> <p><span>  One  of  the  chief  duties  of  the  Com-</span><span>  mission,  wc  apprehend,  will  be  to  ascer-</span><span>  tain  the  true  comparative  values  of  what</span><span>  are  respectively  known  as  the  national</span><span>  and  the  denominational  systems.  The</span><span>  members  will,  it  maybe  presumed,  inquire</span><span>  into  the  working  of  the  vested  schools  in</span><span>  this  colony,  and  let  the  public</span><span>  know  whether  in  points  of  efficiency</span><span>  and  economy  those  institutions</span><span>  are  sucli  as  the  public  are  entitled  to</span><span>  expect.  The  non-vested  schools  will</span><span>  receive  attention,  and  it  will  bc  shown</span><span>  whether  these  institutions  impart,  ai</span><span>  alleged  by  their  advocates,  an  education</span><span>  equal  to  that  given  in  the  vested  schools</span><span>  and  at  a  much  less  cost.  We  shall  alsr</span><span>  leam  whether  clerical  influence  succeed;</span><span>  in  attracting  to  these  schools  childrer</span><span>  who  would  otherwise  grow  up  in  ignor</span><span>  ance.  And  finally,  we  shall  also  lean</span><span>  whether  the  scandals  prevalent  will</span><span>  regard  to  such  schools  have  any  founda</span></p> <p><span>  tion  in  fact.  The  Board  iias  issued  a</span><span>  strict  mandate  against  teachers  in  non</span><span>  vested  schools  givingreligious  instruction,</span><span>  yet  it  is  broadly  declared  that  such  in-</span><span>  struction  is  still  imparted,  and  that</span><span>  lesson-books  arc  still  used  which  have</span></p> <p><span>  an  unmistakeably  proselyting  tendency.</span><span>  These  imputations  are  either  true  or</span><span>  false,  and  it  will,  we  presume,  be  the</span><span>  duty  of  the  Commission  to  set  all  doubts</span><span>  at  rest  with  respect  to  them.  If  true,</span><span>  no  further  proof  will  be  required  of  the</span><span>  viciousness  of  the  system,  as  one  sup-</span><span>  ported  by  the  public  moneys,  for  it  is</span><span>  monstrous  that  in  State  -  endowed</span><span>  schools  parents  should  incur  the  risk  of</span><span>  having  their  children  taught  doctrines</span><span>  which  they  believe  to  be  essentially  per-</span><span>  nicious  and  soul-destroying.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  important  question  for  the</span><span>  Commission  to  pronounce  upon  is  how</span><span>  to  prevent  the  abuses  which  have  crept</span><span>  into  our  grammar  school  system,  and</span><span>  which  have  given  to  our  secondary</span><span>  schools  the  character  of  class  institu-</span><span>  tions.  Knotty  points  will  also  arise  in</span><span>  connection  with  the  proposed  extension</span><span>  of  free  education  to  the  higher  schools,</span><span>  and  with  the  establishment  of  the</span><span>  contemplated  university.  There  is  a</span><span>  wide  divergence  of  opinion  as  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  propriety  ot  free  education  irom  top</span><span>  to  bottom.""  It  seems  to  be  now</span></p> <p><span>  universally  admitted  that  essential</span><span>  elementary  instruction  must  bc  imparted</span><span>  absolutely  free  of  cost,  but  the  balance</span><span>  of  opinion  appears  to  be  in  favour  of</span><span>  making  a  charge  for  secondary  education,</span><span>  and  providing  for  the  wants  of  genius  in</span><span>  humble  life  by  the  granting  of  liberal</span><span>  scholarships.  Mr.  LILLEY,  as  is  well</span><span>  known,  advocates  gratuitous  education</span><span>  from  the  infant  school  to  thc  university,</span><span>  and  we  confess  to  much  sympathy  with</span><span>  that  principle.  Its  uniform  application</span><span>  and  simplicity  are  important  considera-</span><span>  tions  in  its  favour.  On  the  other  hand,</span><span>  the  imposition  of  fees  for  the  more</span><span>  advanced  instruction  is  beset  with</span><span>  innumerable  complications,  and  cal-</span><span>  culated  to  foster  class  jealousies.  The</span><span>  standard  for  the  free  schools  could  not</span><span>  be  fixed  without  much  heart-burning.</span><span>  Most  people  admit  that  educa-</span><span>  tion  now-a-days  must  comprise  some-</span><span>  thing  beyond  the  three  Rs,  and  it</span><span>  would  be  hopeless  to  recommend</span><span>  that  free  instruction  should  be  contracted</span><span>  within  such  limits  ;  and,  if  it  be  deter-</span><span>  mined  that  elementary  education  of  all</span><span>  kinds  shall  be  imparted  free  of  cost,  the</span><span>  standard  will  embrace  studies  which  to  a</span><span>  large  proportion  of  scholars  must  be</span></p> <p><span>  deemed  non-essentials.  We  are  at  a</span></p> <p><span>  loss  to  discover  any  satisfactory  point  at</span></p> <p><span>  which  the  State  shall  draw  the  line</span><span>  between  free  and  paid  education,  and  it</span><span>  is  not  very  probable  that  the  Royal  Com-</span><span>  mission  will  succeed  in  finding  it.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  one  very  important  branch  of</span><span>  the  question,  however,  on  which  good</span><span>  may  be  anticipated  from  the  labours  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  Commission.  It  has  been  with  j</span><span>  the  existing  Board  of  Education  an  j</span><span>  insoluble  problem  how  to  procure  j</span><span>  a  supply  of  trained  and  skilful</span><span>  teachers,  -and  the  consequence  is  that</span><span>  many  of  our  public  schools  are  lament-</span><span>  ably  deficient  in  teaching  power.  It  is,</span><span>  we  think,  less  a  question  of  number  than</span><span>  of  quality,  for  the  percentage  of  incom-</span><span>  petent  teachers  is  generally  believed  to</span><span>  be  unduly  great.  Surely  there  must  be</span><span>  some  practicable  means  of  grappling</span><span>  with  this  difficulty.  Our  present  educa-</span><span>  tional  system  is  costly  enough,  in  ail  con-</span><span>  science,  but  without  competent  teachers</span><span>  we  can  only  expect  the  minimum  of</span><span>  instruction  with  the  maximum  of  expense.</span><span>  The  remedy  will  probably  be  found  in</span><span>  better  training  schools  for  one  thing,  and</span><span>  in  the  offering  of  prize  appointments  for</span><span>  another.  Possibly  our  school  teachers</span><span>  are  not  as  a  body  much  under-paid  ;  but</span><span>  theirs  is  a  hopeless  calling.  They  appear</span><span>  to  have  no  chance  of  rising  beyond  the</span></p> <p><span>  monotonous  level  of  head-master  of  one</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  larger  schools,  a  position  which,</span><span>  after  all,  is  barely  worth  attaining.  Were</span><span>  there  a  few  well-paid  appointments  open</span><span>  to  men  of  unusual  industry  and  talent,  !</span></p> <p><span>  a  better  class  of  men  would  be  found  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  ranks  of  our  school  teachers,  and  the  I</span><span>  whole  tone  of  our  educational  system</span><span>  would  be  raised.  But  without  such  an</span><span>  attraction  thc  walk  of  life  trodden  by  the</span><span>  school  teacher  will  be  availed  of  only  by</span><span>  youths  of  inferior  intellectual  power;  and</span><span>  parents  who  find  their  sons  not  equal  to</span><span>  the  strain  of  one  of  the  higher  professions,</span><span>  will  fall  back  upon  school  teaching  as  a</span><span>  pursuit  in  which  mediocrity  forms  no</span><span>  insuperable  barrier  to  success  within  its</span><span>  own  narrow  sphere.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Commission,  it  may  be  antici-</span><span>  pated,  will  not  confine  its  attention  to</span><span>  Queensland,  but  extend  its  inquiries  to  the</span><span>  other  colonies,  to  Europe,  and  America.</span><span>  In  Victoria,  alone,  is  a  wide  field  for  iu</span><span>  !  vestigation,and  it  lias  the  advantagcof  not</span></p> <p><span>  being  inconvenientlvdistant.  There  is  one</span></p> <p><span>  thing  to  be  borne  in  mind,  however.</span><span>  The  question  of  education,  throughout</span><span>  the  civilised  world,  is  in  a  transition  state,</span><span>  the  duty  of  the  Government  instructing</span><span>  tlie  people  being  but  a  modem  doctrine.</span><span>  Wc  must  not  therefore  too  lavishly</span><span>  follow  precedent  in  the  matter,  but</span><span>  endeavour  to  take  advantage  of  the</span><span>  experience  of  other  countries,  and  resolve</span><span>  upon  founding  an  educational  system  cal-</span><span>  culated  to  place  our  youth  in  the  van  of</span><span>  intellectual  progress.</span></p> <p><span>  THC  want  of  more  frequent  steam  com-</span><span>  munication  between  Rockhampton  and</span><span>  the  northern  ports  has  induced  a  number</span><span>  of  gentlemen  interested  to  convene  a</span><span>  meeting  for  Tuesday  nest,  the  object</span><span>  being  to  arrange  for  chartering  or</span><span>  purchasing  a  suitable  steamer  for  the</span><span>  northern  trade.  Wc  gladly  notice  this</span><span>  determination  on  the  part  of  our  trading</span><span>  community  to  help  themselves,  for  tiiat</span><span>  there  is  business  to  be  done  if  means  of</span><span>  quick  transit  be  provided,  no  one</span><span>  acquainted  with  the  circumstances  can</span><span>  doubt.  The  local  agent  of  thc  A.S.N.</span><span>  Company  have  for  years  reported</span><span>  that  the  Tinonee,  s.s.,  is  inadequate  to  the</span><span>  wants  of  the  trade,  and  have  urged  the</span><span>  putting  on  of  another  steamer.  And</span><span>  that,  we  have  every  reason  to  believe,</span><span>  would  have  been  done  had  not  the</span><span>  Government  stepped  in  and  subsidised</span><span>  the  Company's  steamboats  lo  give  our</span></p> <p><span>  port  the  go-by.  The  geographical  posi-</span><span>  tion  of  Rockhampton,  however,  gives</span><span>  our  merchants  advantages  in  carrying  on</span><span>  the  northern  trade  that  Brisbane  does</span><span>  not  possess,  and  there  is  not  the</span><span>  slightest  doubt  that  if  a  suitable  steamer</span><span>  be  put  on  she  will  pay  well,  and  mate-</span></p> <p><span>  rially  help  in  developing  the  trade  of  our  :</span><span>  port.  Because  Brisbane  has  failed  in  !</span></p> <p><span>  the  late  attempt  to  get  up  a  local  steam  !</span><span>  navigation  company  it  by  no  means  ;</span><span>  follows  that,  in  beginning  on  a  more</span><span>  modest  scale,  we  should  fail  also.  We</span><span>  have  found  means  to  carry  on  our</span><span>  Municipal  Council,  oar  School  of  Arts,</span><span>  and  our  Hospital,  in  a  most  successful</span><span>  manner,  while  the  Brisbane  people  have</span><span>  most  notoriously  failed  in  maintaining</span><span>  similar  institutions  -  the  metropolitan</span><span>  council  being  overwhelmed  in  debt,  the</span><span>  school  of  arts  bereft  of  its  buildings,</span><span>  and  the  hospital  necessarily  taken  over</span><span>  by  the  Government.  We  do  not  make</span><span>  these  remarks  for  the  purpose  of  self</span><span>  glorification,  but  to  inspire  confidence</span><span>  and  encourage  our  community  to  culti-</span><span>  vate  that  spirit  of  self-reliance  which,</span><span>  combined  with  united  action,  has  been</span><span>  hitherto  the  secret  of  success.  We  hope</span><span>  this  matter  of  steam  communication  will</span><span>  be  taken  up  with  animation,  in  which</span><span>  case  the  truth  of  the  adage  that  ""  Heaven</span><span>  helps  those  who  help  themselves,""  will</span><span>  be  speedily  exemplified.</span></p> ",Article,1874-08-12,"The Rockhampton Bulletin, WITH WHICH IS INCORPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER.

Of  the</span><span>  47,450  persons  so  brought  under  the</span><span>  influence  of  local  self-government,  the</span><span>  municipality  of  Brisbane  is  estimated  to</span><span>  contain  15,000,  Rockhampton  and  Mary-</span><span>  borough  each  5500,  Ipswich  4821,</span><span>  Toowoomba  3200,  Warwick  3000,</span><span>  Copperfield  and  Dalby  2000  each,</span><span>  Mackay  1200,  Townsville  800,  Bowen</span><span>  700,  and  thc  remaining  six  still  smaller</span><span>  numbers.  The  return  which  furnishes</span><span>  these  figures,  however,  although  officiai,</span><span>  contains  internal  evidence  of  inaccuracy,</span><span>  for  in  an  adjoining  column  the  number</span><span>  of  dwellings  in  each  municipality  is  also</span><span>  given.  Tested  by  these,  the  population</span><span>  of  the  respective  towns  will  present  a</span><span>  very  different  appearance.  The  return,</span><span>  we  presume,  is  compiled  from  municipal</span><span>  records,  which  should  give  the  number</span><span>  of  dwellings  with  exactness,  but</span><span>  the  stated  population  is  evidently</span><span>  the  merest  guess-work.  If,  therefore,</span><span>  we  make  an  estimate  of  the  population</span><span>  by  multiplying  the  number  of  dwellings</span><span>  by  four  and  a-half-assuming  that  to  be</span><span>  the  average  number  of  persons  living  in</span><span>  each  house-we  ought  to  arrive  at  a</span><span>  pretty  accurate  conception  of  the  actual</span><span>  population  of  each  municipality  some</span><span>  twelve  months  ago.  Allowances,  oi</span><span>  course,  must  be  made  for  empty  dwell-</span><span>  ings  in  towns  in  a  state  of  decadence,  but</span><span>  only  two  or  three  in  the  list  come  undei</span><span>  that  head.  Again,  thc  population  even</span><span>  thus  ascertained  will  not  give  a  true  con-</span><span>  ception  of  the  population  of  the  towns</span><span>  named,  owing  to  the  varying  sizes  of  the</span><span>  different  municipalities.  For  example,</span><span>  the  municipality  of  Brisbane  contains</span><span>  only  2183.acres,  which  indicates  thal</span><span>  although  South  Brisbane  is  included  with-</span><span>  in  the  civic  boundaries,  the  environs  ol</span><span>  North  Brisbane  must  be  excluded.  Geo-</span><span>  graphically  again,  Maryborough,  with</span><span>  25,000  acres,  is  nearly  twelve  times  as</span><span>  large  as  the  metropolitan  municipality,</span><span>  while  Rockhampton,  with  15,000  acres,</span><span>  does  not  include  that  part  ol  the  town</span><span>  situated  on  the  north  side.  The  ap-</span><span>  pended  table  will  assist  the  reader  in</span><span>  testing  the  official  return"",  but  we  cannot</span><span>  claim  that  either  column  represents  the</span><span>  actual  population  :</span></p> <p><span>  r.itlmalcd  Ksttmmod  IVi|iiil«tlor,</span><span>  Dwellings.  l'oimlHiiun.  mi;  ciel</span><span>  .

Since  then  dozens  of  houses  have</span><span>  been  erected,  and  yet  the  return  now</span><span>  before  us  states  the  number  of  dwellings</span><span>  at  1100,  and  the  population  at  5500,  the</span><span>  latter  exactly  the  same  as  Maryborough  ;</span><span>  while,  curiously  enough,  the  dwellings</span><span>  within  the  municipality  of  Maryborough</span><span>  are  estimated  to  number  only  820.</span><span>  According  to  the  census  of  1871,  Mary-</span><span>  borough  contained  733dwellingsand3542</span><span>  persons.  How  the  figures  in  the  return  are</span><span>  arrived  at  we  are  at  a  loss  to  discover,</span><span>  but  it  looks  as  though  some  ambitious</span><span>  alderman  had  set  down  the  population</span><span>  of  Maryborough  as  5500,  in-order  to</span><span>  make  that  town  appear  equal  to</span><span>  Rockhampton.  Bowen,  again,  accord-</span><span>  ing  to  thc  census  of  1871,</span><span>  contained  188  houses  and  715</span><span>  persons.  Since  that  time  the  town  has</span><span>  certainly  not  been  progressing,  yet  the</span><span>  return  just  issued  states  the  dwellings  at</span><span>  225-an  increase  of  37  ;  and  the</span><span>  population  at  700-a  decrease  of  15.</span><span>  Other  instances  might  be  given  to  prove</span><span>  that  the  return,  so  far  as  population  is</span><span>  concerned,  is  absolutely  valueless.</span></p> <p><span>  The  difficulties  of  corporations  in  the</span><span>  formation  of  streets  is  indicated  by  the</span><span>  total  mileage  within  each  municipality.</span><span>  In  Brisbane  there  are  only  47  miles  of</span><span>  streets,  while  in  Ipswich  there  are  33,  in</span><span>  Maryborough  74,  and  in  Rockhampton</span><span>  76.  And  as  in  Rockhampton  our  streets</span><span>  are  half  a  chain  broader  than  in  the  other</span><span>  towns  named,  their  formation  and</span><span>  repair  will  form  a  heavy  permanent</span><span>  charge  upon  the  municipal  funds.  It</span><span>  must  not  bc  forgotten,  however,  that</span><span>  our  streets  are  nearly  level,  and  that  we</span><span>  have  close  at  hand  an  abundant  supply</span><span>  of  the  very  best  road  metal.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  table  contained  in  the  return</span><span>  shows  the  financial  position  of  the</span><span>  various  municipalties,  with  their  receipts</span><span>  and  expenditure.  Thc  total  estimated</span><span>  value  of  all  rateable  properly  in  the</span><span>  colony  slightly  exceeds  three  and  a-Iialf</span><span>  millions  sterling.  On  this  the  total</span><span>  amount  of  rates  levied  last  year  was</span><span>  ^16,476.  The  cash  assets  of  the</span><span>  various  municipalties  on  the  date  of</span><span>  balancing  amounted  to  .£11,171,  while</span><span>  the  liabilities  and  loans  reached  the</span></p> <p><span>  respectable  total  of  ¿£58,852.  The</span><span>  total  receipts  for  last  year  were  slightly</span><span>  under  .¿55,000,  but  less  titan  one-fourtli</span><span>  of  this  was  realised  from  rates,  theGovern</span><span>  mcnt  contributing  ¿£19,000,  and  the  re-</span><span>  ceipts  from  other  sources,  presumably</span><span>  from  tolls  and  dues,  being  ¿£2  2,000.</span><span>  The  rates  collected  at  Brisbane  amounted</span><span>  TO  J£5348;  at  Ipswich,  .£1000;  at</span><span>  Maryborough,  ,£761  ;  at  Rockhampton,</span><span>  ^1741  ;  at  Toowoomba,  1182;  at</span><span>  Mackay,  .£510  ;  and  at  Townsville,</span><span>  jCil3-  The  total  receipts  for  the  year</span><span>  from  all  sources  were  :  By  Brisbane,</span><span>  13,364  ;  by  Ipswich,  .£1407  ;  by  Mary-</span><span>  borough,  ,£10,144;  by  Rockhampton,</span><span>  .¿6970  :  by  Toowoomba,  5739  ;  by</span><span>  Mackay,  .£2712;  and  by  Townsville,</span><span>  ,£1877.

Mis  argu-</span><span>  ments  in  favour  of  financial  separation</span><span>  are  just  a  recapitulation  of  those  which</span><span>  have  been  suited,  iterated,  and  reiterated</span><span>  'in  these  columns  for  years  past  in  advo-</span><span>  cating  financial  as  a  prelude  lo  territorial</span><span>  separation,  bul  the  writer  carefully</span><span>  omits  to  common!  upon  the  objec-</span><span>  tionable  and  illogical  feature  of  this</span><span>  part  of  tho  northern  programme.  His</span><span>  reasoning  may  go  lo  prove  tho  necessity</span><span>  of  decentralisation,  bul  we  tail  to  lind  in</span><span>  il  a  single  valid  argument  in  favour  of</span><span>  financial  separation  al  Cape  Palmerston,</span><span>  with  a  view  to  the  ultim  ito  removal  of</span><span>  tho  capital.  Such  lop  sided  legislation</span><span>  will  certainly  nut  lind  favour  with  the</span><span>  present  Parliament,  however  stoutly  en-</span><span>  forced  hythe  ""  ingenuity  and  coah'jion''</span><span>  of  the  newly  formed  party.</span></p> <p><span>  The  chango  of  &lt;¿ipil.il  is  no  new</span><span>  remedy  for  the  grievances  of  Northern</span><span>  Queensland,  but  we  hav  e  always  failed</span><span>  to  perceive  the  force  of  the  arguments</span><span>  used  in  its  favour.  It  is  scarcely  rea-</span><span>  sonable  to  ask  that  the  grievances  of  tho</span><span>  small  minority  in  the  North  shall  be  re-</span><span>  dressed  at  the  expense  of  the  overwhelm-</span><span>  ing  majority  in  tho  South,  lt  would  be</span><span>  a  great  convenience  la  the  three  northern</span><span>  members  lo  attend  a  Parliament  al</span><span>  lïowoii.  but  it  would  homme  an  intolera-</span><span>  ble  grievance  with  the  thirty-nine  other</span><span>  members  lo  be  compelled  to  reside  for</span><span>  half  tho  year  in  thal  remólo  place,</span><span>  liven  the  load  representatives  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Central  districts^in  which  we  include</span><span>  Rockhampton,  Blackall,  Port  Curtis,  and</span><span>  the  five  inland  electorates  of  'which</span><span>  Rockhampton  is  the  port-would  find</span><span>  it  much  more  inconvenient  and  less</span></p> <p><span>  agreeable  to  perform  their  legislative</span></p> <p><span>  ditties  at  Bowen  than  at  Brisbane.</span><span>  And  in  lite  matter  of  administration</span></p> <p><span>  the  proposed  change  of  capital  is  equally</span><span>  objectionable.  Except  that  thc  extreme</span><span>  North  may  now  be  cntitjed  to  another</span><span>  member  on  thc  ground  of  recent</span><span>  accessions  of  population,  the  present</span><span>  distribution  of  the  representation  is  fail</span><span>  to  all  parts  of  the  colony.  Therefore,</span><span>  just  as  Brisbane  is  the  most  convenient</span><span>  point  for  the  majority  in  the  matter  of</span><span>  legislation,  it  must  also  be  deemed  the</span><span>  most  convenient  in  that  of  administra-</span><span>  tion.  Thc  arguments  against  a  change</span><span>  of  capital  lo  Howen  apply  in  an  inferior</span><span>  degree  to  Gladstone  ami  Maryborough  ;</span><span>  and  on  thc  whole  lhere  can  be  no  doubt</span><span>  that  Brisbane  is  the  most  convenient</span><span>  capital  site  for  the  bulk  of  the  popula-</span><span>  tion.  In  consulting  the  greatest  good  of</span><span>  the  greatest  number,  therefore,  we  shall</span><span>  be  obliged  to  leave  the  scat  of  govern-</span><span>  ment  for  tlie  present  undisturbed.  The</span><span>  time  will  come,  however,  and  is  probably</span><span>  not  very  far  distant,  when  the  conditions</span><span>  will  be  altogether  changed.  In  a  few</span><span>  years  it  may  be  expected  that  Brisbane</span></p> <p><span>  «ill  cease  to  be  the  most  convenient</span></p> <p><span>  capital  for  thc  majority  of  thc  population,</span><span>  but  then  if  all  parts  of  the  colony  be</span><span>  fairly  represented  the  required  change</span><span>  will  be  easily  made  by  a  vole  of  the</span><span>  majority  in  the  Legislative  Assembly.</span></p> <p><span>  When  the  numerical  balance  of  members</span><span>  is  in  favour  of  the  North,  thc  Souih  will</span><span>  lind  it  no  longer  practicable  to  retain  the</span><span>  «?al  of  government  at  lirisbane.  For</span><span>  these  reasons  we  conclude  that  this  part</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  northern  programme  lays  down  a  !</span><span>  course  of  action  thal  is  neither  just  nor</span><span>  politic  at  the  present  juncture.</span></p> <p><span>  The  alternative-territorial  separation</span><span>  at  Cape  Palmerston-is  an  entirely  diffe-</span><span>  rent  matter  ;  bul  it  will  be  found  equally</span><span>  repugnant  to  the  groat  majority  of</span><span>  members  in  the  new  Assembly.  If  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  central  districts  wc  look  forward  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  lime  when  the  seat  of  government</span><span>  shall  be  removed  to  a  ¿nore  convenient</span><span>  position,  we  can  hardly  be  expected  to</span><span>  assent  lo  a  policy  which  would  .preclude</span><span>  all  hope  of  our  ever  securing  the  desired</span><span>  change.  Our  demand  in  years  past  was</span><span>  for  Separation  at  Dawes'  Range,  and  for</span><span>  a  new  colony  whose  constitution  should</span><span>  form  a  guarantee  against  the  centralisa-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  of  which  the  northern  members</span></p> <p><span>  complain.  Rightly  or  wrongly,  the</span><span>  petitioners,  prayed  for  the  initial  establish-</span><span>  ment  of  provincial  institutions.  And</span><span>  now  that  the  Imperial  Government  have</span><span>  refused  even  to  consider  the  prayer  of</span><span>  our  petition,  our  hope  is  that  the  rapid</span><span>  How  of  population  northward  will  be  the</span><span>  most  certain  remedy  for  existing  griev-</span><span>  ances,  and  the  best  security  for  future</span><span>  justice.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  thus  been  insensibly  led  into</span></p> <p><span>  the  consideration  of  a  ""  Northern  Man's""</span><span>  fourth  paper,  which  we  regret  lo  say  is</span><span>  the  most  injudicious  of  the  series,  and  is</span><span>  calculated  lo  rendel'  nugatory  the</span><span>  ""  resultant  advantages  ""  expected  to</span><span>  accrue  from  the  premature  publication  of</span><span>  the  triumvirate  programme.

Firstly,  Separation</span><span>  was  only  urged  ;ts  a  means  to  an  cud  -</span><span>  thal  end  being  justice.  Secondly,  as</span><span>  soon  as  thc  petition  was  sent  home,  ami</span><span>  Mr.  AKCHKK  appointed  to  lay  it  ""at  the</span><span>  fool  of  the  Throne,""  the  local  Parlia-</span><span>  ment  passed  a  measure  giving  substantial</span><span>  guarantees  of  future  justice-we  refer</span></p> <p><span>  lo  the  Electoral  Districts  Arl</span></p> <p><span>  of  iS/2,  which  gave  lo  the</span><span>  country  north  of  Dawes'  Range</span><span>  five  ailiiition.il  representatives,  and</span><span>  twelve  vciles  in  a  House  of  forty-two</span><span>  members.  Thirdly,  the  legislature  ful-</span><span>  filled  a  previously  disregarded  pledge  by</span><span>  voling  a  sum  for  our  railway  extension  ;</span><span>  and  fourthly.  Earl  KiMiucRl.r.v  informed</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  ARCHKR  that  he  could  not  recom-</span><span>  mend  Ili.u  MAJKSTV  to  consider  our</span><span>  petition  until  an  expression  of  opinion</span><span>  upon  il  had  been  obtained  from  the</span><span>  Queensland  Legislature  or  Govemmenl.</span><span>  Surely  these  circumstances  fully  justified</span><span>  a  discontinuance  of  the  separation</span><span>  agitation.  Indeed,  had  it  bcea  con</span></p> <p><span>  linued,  the  epithets  applied  to  1</span></p> <p><span>  the  leaders  of  thc  movement  by</span><span>  our  southern  opponents  would  not  have  ?</span><span>  been  altogether  undeserved.  Having</span></p> <p><span>  started  with  tile  Announcement  that</span></p> <p><span>  justice  and  not  Separation  was  our  pri-</span><span>  mary  aim,  we  could  not  reasonably  per-</span><span>  sist  after  justice  was  conceded.</span></p> <p><span>  With  regard  lo  thc  ""half-million  of</span><span>  money""  which  appears  to  be  the  stumb-</span><span>  ling-block  of  the  northern  members,  we</span><span>  can  only  repeat  that  this  part  of  the</span><span>  colony  is  prepared  to  take  the  full  re-</span><span>  sponsibility  of  that  expenditure  ;  and  we</span><span>  have  no  doubt  that  the  representatives</span><span>  of  the  constituencies  benefiting  by  the</span><span>  railway  will  join  cordially  with  thc  nor-</span><span>  thern  members  in  passing  a  measure  for</span><span>  equitably  re  adjusting  the  loan  burdens</span><span>  of  the  colony.  It  may  also  be  hoped</span><span>  that  the  members  for  the  central  districts</span></p> <p><span>  mil,  despite  the  vagaries  of  the  triumvi-</span><span>  rate,  unite  heartily  with  it  in  demanding</span></p> <p><span>  a  full  share  of  administrative  attention</span></p> <p><span>  and  expenditure  for  the  ""vast  territory</span><span>  lying  to  the  north  of  Cape  Palmerston.""</span></p> ",Article,1874-02-23,"The Rockhampton Bulletin, WITH WHICH IS INCORPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER.

As  may  be  pre-</span><span>  sumed,  it  is  the  long-promised  measure</span><span>  which  is  to  compel  the  dummiers  of  the</span><span>  Darling  Downs  to  disgorge  their  ill-gotten</span><span>  principalities.  At  first  sight  the  bill</span><span>  appears  to  create  a  new  and  inquisitorial</span><span>  tribunal,  which  ought  to  bc  wholly  un-</span><span>  necessary  if  the  Government  and  the</span><span>  existing  law  courts  did  their  strict  duty.</span><span>  But  this  both  arc  said  to  bc  unable  to  do,</span><span>  and  hence  the  necessity  to  create  a</span><span>  special  court,  to  be  presided  over</span><span>  by  an  official  created  for  that  purpose,</span><span>  and  designated  the  ""Judicial  Commis-</span><span>  sioner.""

The  bill</span><span>  seems  to  make  no  provision  for  a  renewal</span><span>  of  the  appointment,  from  which  it  may</span><span>  be  concluded  that  Mr.  STEPHENS  expects</span><span>  within  three  years  to  extirpate  the  whole</span><span>  dummy  fraternity,  in  which  wc  hope  he</span><span>  »rill  not  be  so  unfortunate  as  to  be  dis-</span><span>  appointed.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Judicial  Commissioner  will  hold</span><span>  inquiries,  in  open  Court,  in  any  of  the</span><span>  following  cases  :</span></p> <p><span>  Where  any  person  ia  charger!  with  having</span><span>  obtained  a  lease  of,  or  possession  of  Grown</span><span>  land,  or  any  certificate  or  other  document  by</span><span>  any  violation  of,  fraud  upon,  or  evasion  of  any</span><span>  of  thc  provisions  of  thc  ""Agricultural  Ueserves</span><span>  Act  ot  18G3,""  ortho  ""  Leasing  Act  oí  lSlili""</span></p> <p><span>  or  the  ""Crown  Linds  Alienation  Act  of</span><span>  18GS""  or  ""The  Homestead  Arcas  Act  of</span><span>  1872.""</span></p> <p><span>  Whore  auy  person  who  has  obtained  any</span><span>  lease,  certificate,  or  other  document,  not  being</span><span>  a  deed  of  grant  under  the  groat  seal  of  tho</span><span>  colony,  under  any  of  tho  said  Acts,  is  charged</span><span>  with  having  done  or  omitted  to  do  anything</span><span>  the  doing  or  omission  of  which  would  under</span><span>  tho  said  Acts  or  any  of  them  take  away  or</span><span>  deprive  him  of  the  right  to  such  lcaso,  certifi-</span><span>  cate,  or  other  document.</span></p> <p><span>  Thc  GOVERNOR  in  Council  is  to  ap-</span><span>  point  by  proclamation  the  times  and</span><span>  i  places  for  holding  said  enquiries,  and  the</span></p> <p><span>  SECRETARY  FOR  PUIILIC  LANDS  is  alone</span></p> <p><span>  !  to  be  empowered  to  make  charges  under</span></p> <p><span>  the  bill.

It  is  also  1</span><span>  provided  that  rules  may  be  made  by  the</span><span>  Commissioner,  to  be  approved  by  the</span><span>  GovF.RNOR-in-Council,  for  carrying  ont</span><span>  the  provisions  of  the  new  statute.</span></p> <p><span>  That  in  the  event  of  this  bill  becoming</span><span>  law  a  remedy  will  bc  provided  against</span><span>  the  evil  of  dummying  may  perhaps  be</span><span>  admitted.  Hut  there  is  too  much  reason</span><span>  to  fear  that  the  ""Judicial  Commissioner""</span><span>  will  be  selected  because  of  the  sound-</span><span>  ness  of  his  opinions  upon  the  land</span><span>  question;  that  inquiries  may  be  so  ordered</span><span>  as  to  vex  and  worry  political  opponents  ;</span><span>  and  that,  while  the  law  may  hamper</span><span>  the  great  monopolist,  it  may  also</span><span>  become  a  means  of  oppressing  the</span><span>  struggling  settler  who  in  the  hope  of</span><span>  improving  his  condition  of  life  has</span><span>  perhaps  unconsciously  violated  some</span><span>  provision  of  the  land  laws.  It  may  be</span><span>  admitted  that  the  intentions  of  the</span><span>  present  MINISTER  FOR  LANDS  are  good,</span><span>  but  his  new  law  must  be  one  for  both</span></p> <p><span>  rich  and  poor  alike,  and  although  the</span><span>  Minister  alone  can  set  the  machinery  in</span><span>  motion,  the  public  will  not  tolerate  its</span><span>  partial  administration.  If  applied  at  all,</span><span>  its  provisions  must  be  brought  to  bear</span><span>  upon  all  classes  of  offenders,  and  it</span><span>  therefore  becomes  a  question  whether</span><span>  thc  benefit  it  is  likely  to  confer  will  not</span><span>  be  more  than  balanced  by  the  general</span><span>  harrassment  and  uncertainty  of  tenure</span><span>  which  it  will  carry  in  its  train.  Were</span><span>  the  inquiries  conducted  personally  by</span><span>  the  Minister,  there  would  be  direct</span><span>  responsibility  to  Parliament,  but  the</span><span>  Commissioner  will  be  an  irresponsible</span><span>  functionary,  and  against  his  decision</span><span>  there  will  be  practically  no  appeal.</span><span>  The  fact  that  all  inquiries  are  to</span><span>  be  held  in  open  court  is  the</span><span>  only  guarantee  of  strict  justice  afforded</span><span>  by  the  bill,  but  even  that  is  insufficient</span><span>  where  the  judge  is  the  servant  of  the</span><span>  plaintiff.  It  would  be  rash  to  venture</span><span>  an  opinion  as  to  the  probability  of  the</span><span>  measure  becoming  law,  but  it  is  tolerably</span><span>  certain  that  its  course  through  both</span><span>  Houses  will  be  contested  inch  by  inch.</span></p> <p><span>  Upon  their  success  in  passing  this  Frauds  j</span></p> <p><span>  Hill  and  the  Land  Sales  Bill  the  fate  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  Ministry  unmjslakeably  hangs,  and</span></p> <p><span>  no  one  who  has  watched  the  course  of</span></p> <p><span>  land  legislation  in  the  colonies  would  be</span><span>  surprised  at  an  appeal  to  the  country</span></p> <p><span>  being  necessary  to  solve  the  knotty  j</span><span>  questions  suggested  by  these  twin</span></p> <p><span>  measures.</span></p> <p><span>  Wr.  understand  tLat  the  Police  Magistrate  j</span><span>  has  written  to  thc  authorities,  at  tho  instiga-  j</span><span>  tion  ot  th«  Health  Oflieer.  drawing  their  j</span><span>  attention  to  thc  dilapidated  condition  of  thc</span><span>  weatherboard  shod,  dignified  in  these  Franco</span><span>  English  times  by  the  expression-morgue.</span><span>  The  fences  enclosing  tho  structure  arc  very</span><span>  much  ont  of  repair,  and  the  building  itself,  in</span></p> <p><span>  its  present  stato  especially,  is  a  positive  dis-  j</span><span>  grace  to  the  town.  !</span></p> <p><span>  Tur.  sale  of  general  merchandise  in  thc</span><span>  estate  of  tho  late  Mr.  H.  .1.

In  the  first  place,  members</span></p> <p><span>  had  to  be  assured  before  taking  it  in  |</span><span>  hand,  that  they  might  alter  it  to  please</span><span>  their  fancy,  save  the  provision  for  the  re-</span><span>  sumption  of  the  ten  years'  leases  in  the</span><span>  Settled  Districts.  The  House  certainly</span><span>  used  the  liberty  thus  given  with  great</span><span>  freedom,  and  patched  and  cobbled  the</span><span>  bill  almost  clause  by  clause  before  they</span><span>  could  make  up  their  minds  to  let</span><span>  it  pass.  However,  it  did  in  a  manner</span><span>  pass  thc  Lower  House  ;  but  only</span><span>  to  undergo  even  rougher  treatment</span><span>  in  the  Council.'  On  Wednesday,  the</span><span>  Council  were  in  committee  on  the  bill,</span><span>  and  made  ""numerous  amendments,""</span><span>  not  sparing  intact  the  one  vital  provision</span><span>  which  Mr.  STEPHENS  had  so  carefully</span><span>  guarded  in  the  Commons.  For  we  leam</span><span>  that  an  amendment  was  made  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  ninth  clause,  which  provided  for  the</span><span>  resumption  of  the  leased  halves,  stipu-</span><span>  lating  that  by  way  of  compensation  for</span><span>  the  cancellation  of  leases,  the  lessee</span><span>  shall  be  permitted  to  select  one-tenth  of</span><span>  thc  land  resumed.  The.Hcusc  seems</span><span>  to  have  shirked  the  direct  responsibility</span><span>  of  rejecting  the  bill  altogether  by  making</span></p> <p><span>  an  amendment  which  the  Government</span><span>  cannot  accept.  The  bill  in  its  emasculated</span><span>  slate  has  been  referred  back  to  thc</span><span>  Assembly,  where  it  was  last  night  under</span><span>  discussion,  and  we  learn  that  the</span><span>  principal  amendments  made  by  the</span><span>  Upper  House  were  being  rejected.  The</span><span>  upshot  of  all  this  will  surely  be  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  Crown  Lands  Sale  Bill  will  meet  with  a  j</span><span>  similar  fate  to  that  which  overtook  its</span></p> <p><span>  kindred  measure,  the  Land  Frauds  \</span><span>  Bill,  at  an  earlier  period  of  the  session.</span><span>  And  so  the  Land  policy  of  the  present</span><span>  Government  will  pass'away  to  be  no</span><span>  more  seen.-At  least  we  fervently  hope</span></p> <p><span>  so.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  report  of  the  Chief  Inspector  of</span><span>  Distilleries  for  the  year  ending  31st</span><span>  Mardi,  1873,  indicates  that  sugar  grow-</span><span>  ing  continues  to  progress,  and  gives</span><span>  promise  of  soon  becoming  one  of  our</span><span>  most  jmportanl  industries.  The  quantity</span><span>  of  rum  distilled  during  the  year  was</span><span>  164,413  gallons,  just  half  of  which  was</span><span>  manufactured  in  the  Maryborough</span><span>  district.  At  Mackay,  where  the  produce</span><span>  of  sugar  was  325z  tons,  only  49,000</span><span>  gallons  of  rum  was  distilled,  while  at</span><span>  Maryborough  thc  yield  of  sugar  was</span><span>  only  2196,  though  the  rum  produced  was</span><span>  83,000  gallons.  The  Inspector  says</span><span>  thc  contrasl  is  remarkable,  and  attempts</span><span>  to  account  for  it  by  the  luxuriant</span><span>  growth  of  cane  in  the  rich  scrub  soil  of</span></p> <p><span>  me  Maryborough  district  and  thc  more</span><span>  extended  use  of  the  vacuum  pa»  on  thc</span><span>  Mackay  plantations.  No  distilling  has</span><span>  yet  taken  place  in  the  districts  lo  thc</span><span>  north  of  Mackay,  but  it  is  expected  that</span><span>  tliey  before  long  will  be  included</span><span>  amongst  the  licensed  distilling  districts.</span><span>  The  yield  of  sugar  has  increased  from</span><span>  (>zG(>  tons  in  1872-3  to  7987  tons</span><span>  in  1873-4.  Thc  greatest  increase  is</span><span>  sh  omi  al  Mackay,  but  proportionately</span><span>  Cardwell,  which  produced  only  38  tons</span><span>  in  1S72,  and  290  in  1873-4,  shows  thc</span><span>  greatest  progress.  The  Chief  Inspector</span></p> <p><span>  anticipates  that  the  coming  season  will  ?</span><span>  show  a  total  of  to,ooo  tons,  worth,  at  j</span><span>  £:¡  per  ton  all  round,  £250,000.  This</span><span>  displays  a  rate  of  progress  which  must</span><span>  bc  highly  gratifying,  seeing  that  in  1868</span><span>  the  total  yield  of  sugar  was  only  619</span></p> <p><span>  tons.  Il  may  be  hoped  thal  some  of1</span></p> <p><span>  our  landowners  will  take  steps  to  intro-</span></p> <p><span>  duce  the  cultivation  and  manufacture  of</span><span>  sugar  into  the  Rockhampton  district,</span><span>  now  that  the  famous  dry-belt  bugbear</span><span>  has  been  exploded.  That  this  valuable</span><span>  product  may  be  profitably  grown  here</span><span>  no  one  acquainted  with  its  cultivation  in</span><span>  otherparts  of  the  colony  appears  to  doubt.</span><span>  Had  half  the  money  been  invested  in</span><span>  sugar  that  we  have  squandered  in  quartz</span><span>  our  district  would  be  in  a  much  more</span><span>  prosperous  condition  than  it  is  at  pre-</span></p> <p><span>  sent,</span></p> <p><span>  i  '  ""</span></p> ",Article,1874-07-10,"The Rockhampton Bulletin, WICH WHICH IS INCORPORATED THE GLADSTONE OBSERVER.
