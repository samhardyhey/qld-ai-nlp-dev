The  swiftest  racehorse  in</span><span>  the  world  becomes  a  costly  lia*</span><span>  bility  if  he  is  kept  eating  his</span><span>  weight  in  feed  every  ten  weeks  or</span><span>  so  when  he  should  be  racing.  Ex-</span><span>  pensive  machinery  ia  economic  or</span><span>  not  according  to  the  ratio  of  acti-</span><span>  vity  to  idleness.  Unskilled  labour,</span><span>  which  really  pits  itself  against</span><span>  the  machine,  must  work  full  time</span><span>  if  it  is  to  escape  the  bare  susten-</span><span>  ance  of  the  dole.  All  of  these</span><span>  things  are  elementary  truths  that</span><span>  apply  equally  if  a  country  is  under</span><span>  a  dictatorship  and  its  people  are</span><span>  mere  slaves,  or  if  it  is  carried  on</span><span>  by  a  much-despised  capitalism.</span><span>  There  vere  mighty  few  idle  fac-</span><span>  tories  in  Germany  before  and</span><span>  during  the  war,  and  there  are</span><span>  mighty  few  idle  industrial  plants</span><span>  in  Russia  today.  By  whatsoever</span><span>  means  they  are  kept  going  or</span><span>  I  whatever  may  be  the  name  given</span></p> <p><span>  to  auch  measures  so  as  not  to</span><span>  offend  delicate  western  ears  makes</span><span>  Tory  little  difference  to  the  man</span><span>  who  would  throw  a  spanner  into</span><span>  tho  works,  for  he  does  not  remain</span><span>  for  long  in  a  condition  to  know,</span><span>  what  happened  to  him.  That  is  a</span><span>  Russian  institution  to  which  they</span><span>  are  entitled  if  it  suits  them,  ""but</span><span>  it  is  different  in'Australia.</span></p> <p><span>  The  '  last  year  or  so  has  been</span><span>  one  of  steady  industrial  declen-</span><span>  sion,  when  men  in  their  thousands</span><span>  were  thrown  out  of  work  that  was</span><span>  crying  to  be  done  for  people  who</span><span>  aro  desperately  in  need  of  all</span><span>  lands  of  commodities.  Ko  country</span><span>  can  for  long  afford  to  feed  armies</span><span>  of  striking  men,  and  Australia  is</span><span>  no  exception  to  the  rule.  All  sta*</span><span>  tisticg  are  lagging^badly  -indus-</span><span>  trial  by  nine  and  financial  by  four</span><span>  months--but  all  things  point  to  an</span><span>  %3-time  record  of  idle  men  over</span><span>  Tie  past  -year.  Being  on  strike  is</span><span>  regarded  differently  statistically</span><span>  from  being  unemployed,  though</span><span>  the  cost  to  the  nation  differs  only</span><span>  on  degree.  Nor  can  '  the  loss  be</span><span>  reckoned  solely  in  days  of  idleness,</span><span>  for  industry  cannot  be  stopped</span></p> <p><span>  and  started  like  a  clock.  Much  un-</span><span>  productive  dead  work  has  to  be</span><span>  done,  and  such  are  the  ramifica-</span><span>  tions,  of  industry  that  in  some</span><span>  cases  it  is  montis  ere  the  wheels</span><span>  are  again  in  consonance,  while</span><span>  many  commodities  deteriorate</span><span>  through  being  held  and  so  are  a</span><span>  total  lose.  These  losses  are  na-</span><span>  tional  losses,  there  being  no  fairy</span><span>  god  mother  to  drop  along  and  level</span><span>  them  off.  They  come  out  of  the</span><span>  resources-of  the  State  no  matter</span><span>  who  pays  them  or  who  loses  them.</span></p> <p><span>  But  all  losses  are  not  of  man-</span><span>  power.  Millions  of  pounds  worth</span><span>  of  ^production  plant  and  machinery</span><span>  of  every  description,  rolling  stock</span><span>  and  i  steaming  ships  are  rendered</span><span>  lifeless  when  this  union  or  that</span><span>  walks  out  of  its  occupation  'instead</span><span>  of;  walking  into  the  Arbitration</span><span>  Court.  Over  the  last  year  it  has</span><span>  been  a  commonplace  for  fleets  of</span><span>  ships  to  be  rendered  idle  on  a</span><span>  frivolous  excuse  or  on  none  at  all.</span><span>  Whole  systems  of  railways  and</span><span>  strings  of  rpad  transport  have</span><span>  been  rendered  useless,  and  vast</span><span>  production  systems  of  every  kind</span><span>  of  commodity  necessary  to  man's</span><span>  I  comfort  and  well-being  have  been</span></p> <p><span>  rendered  inert  and  useless.

Idle  men,  idle  machines,</span><span>  ?  idle  ships  and  trains  and  idle  plant</span><span>  '  of  every  description  are  a  luxury</span></p> <p><span>  or  madness-that  no  nation  can</span><span>  afford,  and  none  knows  that  bet</span><span>  I  ter  than  the  Communists  who  arc</span><span>  engineering  it  alL  It  all  tends  tc</span><span>  I  a  spiralling  inflation  and  a  sense</span><span>  lof  frustration,  it  inspires  defeat-</span></p> <p><span>  ism  and  confusion,  and  tends  tc</span><span>  j  break  down  confidence  in  the  Aus</span></p> <p><span>  I  tralian  way  of  life.

About  the  same  time,  at</span><span>  the  annual  meeting  of  the  Boy</span><span>  Scouts  Association  of  N.S.W.,  Sir</span><span>  John  Northcott  had  occasion  to  ex-</span><span>  press  regret  at  the  slow  growth  of</span><span>  Scouting  in  that  State,  something</span><span>  that  possibly  is  indicative  of  a</span><span>  general  trend  throughout  the</span><span>  Commonwealth,  though  no  evidence</span><span>  was  offered  on  the  point.  The</span><span>  Governor  laid  stress  upon  the  fact</span><span>  that  a  total  membership  of  only</span><span>  21,000  for  the  whole  of  N.S.W.</span><span>  meant  that  the  movement  was</span><span>  touching  only  a  small  percentage</span><span>  of  the  youth  of  the  State.</span></p> <p><span>  If  this  apparent  apathy  to-</span><span>  wards  our  youth  movements  was</span><span>  all  that  had  to  be  recorded  it</span><span>  would  still  be  a  matter  for  grave</span><span>  concern,  but  there  is  a  more  sinis-</span><span>  ter  aspect.  Whilst  the  membership</span><span>  of  the  Girl  Guides  declines  and</span><span>  the  Boy  Scouts  manage  to  do  little</span><span>  better  than  hold  their  ground,</span><span>  %here  is  a  steady  growth  in  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  of  other  youth  movements</span><span>  whose  objectives,  in  the  words  of</span><span>  Sir  John  Northcott,,  ""are  not  so</span><span>  worthy  and  have  not  6iich  good  in-</span><span>  tentions.""  ""Let  us  not  blind  our-</span><span>  selves  to  the  fact  that  they  aw</span><span>  strong  and  growing,""  said  the</span><span>  chairman  of  the  Scout  meeting.  ""If</span><span>  we  cannot  be  as  effective  and</span><span>  thorough  in  building  up  our  own</span><span>  movement  we  can  have  only  our-</span><span>  selves  to  blame  if  the  next  genera-</span><span>  tion  has  not  been  wisely  guided.</span><span>  We  should  not  rest  until  we  hava</span><span>  at  least  half  of  the  youth  of  the</span><span>  country  in  the  Scouts  and  Guides</span></p> <p><span>  movements.""</span></p> <p><span>  This  is  something  that  bolds  :</span><span>  responsibility  for  others  beside</span><span>  those  directly  concerned  in  the  con</span><span>  duct  of  youth  organisations.  It  ii</span><span>  all  too  ""true  that  the  future  o</span><span>  Australia  resides  in  the  hands  o</span><span>  the  youth  of  the  Commonwealth</span><span>  On  the  actions  and  thoughts  o:</span><span>  the  next  and  .  succeeding  genera'</span><span>  tions  will  depend  whether  Austia</span><span>  Ma  is  to  be  a  Democratic,  or  :</span><span>  Fascist,  or  a  Communist  nation,  o:</span><span>  whether  it  is  to  be  a.  nation  al</span><span>  all.  Youth  movements  founded  01</span><span>  democratic  principles  and  whosi</span><span>  sole  object  is  to  mould  the  char</span><span>  acter  of  its  members  to  manliness</span><span>  and  true  womanliness,  and  incul</span><span>  cate  the  principles  of  good  citizen</span><span>  ship,  should  be  encouraged  to  thc</span><span>  utmost  at  :  this  time  when  thc</span><span>  world  is""  in  process  of  reshaping</span><span>  Jib  plea  of  preoccupation  wit!</span><span>  graver  matters  should  serve  as  au</span><span>  excuse  for  neglect  of  this  public</span><span>  duty.  _</span></p> <p><span>  It  might  be  .worth  while  to  con-</span><span>  duct  an  examination  into  possible</span><span>  reasons  for  the  Scout  and  Guide</span><span>  movements  doing  little  better  than</span><span>  mark  time  at  a  period  when  there</span><span>  is  so  strong  a  call  for  their  ex-</span><span>  pansion.  Certainly  it  cannot  be  at-</span><span>  tributed  to  any  lack  of  appeal  in</span><span>  .objective,  and  there  is  no  question</span><span>  of  the  earnestness  and  devotion  oi</span><span>  those  who  have  dedicated  them-</span><span>  selves  as  leaderg  in  the  work.  Yet</span><span>  it  may  be  that  in  the  competing</span><span>  interests  and  diversions  of  an  ex-</span><span>  citing  scientific  age  even  the  Scout</span><span>  and  Guide  movements  will  find</span><span>  themselves  under  the  necessity  oí</span><span>  inarching  with  the  times  and  en-</span><span>  suring  that  their  methods  are</span><span>  made  as  modern  as  possible.</span></p> <p><span>  Thc  real  cause  of  the  slow  pro-</span><span>  gress  of  these  movements  may  be</span><span>  laid  at  the  door  of  a  lack  of  sym-</span><span>  pathetic  interest  on  the  part  of  the</span><span>  people  at  large.  There  is  nothing</span><span>  which  John  Citizen  is  more  prone</span><span>  to  leave  to  the  willing  few.  Hence</span><span>  the  responsibility  of  stimulating</span><span>  our  organisations  is  not  only  one</span><span>  for  Australian  youth,  but  it  rests</span><span>  upon  parents  and  the  com-</span><span>  munity  as  a  whole.

One  age  group  for</span><span>  which  most  requires  to  be  done  is</span><span>  the  15-21  group,  especially  those</span><span>  who  have  left  school  and  do  not</span><span>  belong  to  any  kind  of  youth  or-</span><span>  ganisation.  Often  they  feel  that</span><span>  they  belong  to  no  one-not  even</span><span>  their  homes.  At  the  present  time</span><span>  many  nations,  including  our  own,</span><span>  are  alarmed  at  the  rebirth  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Comintern,  Little  stress  has  been</span><span>  laid  upon  the  fact  that  the  only</span><span>  way  to  meet  the  challenge  of  an</span><span>  unwelcome  ideology  is  to  convince</span><span>  ourselves  and  make  it  clear  that</span><span>  our  own  system  2s  best.

Combined</span></p> <p><span>  with  sinrnar  disturbances  else</span><span>  where,,  and  the  by  no.  means  en-</span><span>  couraging  spirit  prevalent  at  tnt</span><span>  meeting  of  the  Big  Four  in  Mos-</span><span>  cow,  it  lays  emphasis  on  a  question</span><span>  that  has  been  raised1  more  than</span><span>  once-whether  the  world  was  ready</span><span>  for  peace  when  it  came?</span></p> <p><span>  The  protracted  delay  in  ratifica-</span><span>  tion  by  the  Netherlands  and  In-</span><span>  donesian  Governments  of  the  agree-</span><span>  ment  initialled  last  October  was</span><span>  bound  to  hold  possibilities  of  a</span><span>  fresh  crop  of  disorders,  and  the</span><span>  British  Government  has  felt  con-</span><span>  strained  to  urge  upon  both  sides</span><span>  the  necessity  of  a  speedy  settle-</span><span>  ment  of  outside  issues.  Britain  has</span><span>  a  special  interest  in  wishing  to  see</span><span>  the  October  agreement  imple-</span><span>  mented,  since  8he  played  a  big  part</span><span>  in  bringing  the  Dutch  and  Indo-</span><span>  nesians  together,  and  one  of  her</span><span>  diplomats  presided  over  the  crucial</span><span>  meeting  at  which  the  agreement</span><span>  wa»  reached.  It  is  a  tragedy  that,</span><span>  when  a  mutually  accepted  formula</span><span>  was  found,  there  should  remain  so</span><span>  many  formidable  obstacles,  most  of</span><span>  them  based  on  national  pride  and</span><span>  suspicion.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Dutch  are  held  to  be  not  al-</span><span>  together  blameless  for  the  delay  in</span><span>  signing  the  agreement,  as  they  are</span><span>  insisting  that  there  should  be  at-</span></p> <p><span>  tached  a  memorandum  of  inter-</span><span>  pretation  by  the  Minister  for  Over-</span><span>  seas  Territories.  Thi8  the  Indo-</span><span>  nesians  will  not  accept,  and  argue</span><span>  that  the  Dutch  would  not  have</span><span>  been  prepared  to  accept  the  incor-</span><span>  poration  of  an  Indonesian  interpre-</span><span>  tation  had  its  inclusion  been</span><span>  sought.  Neither  side  has  been  wil-</span><span>  ling  to  acknowledge  that  questions</span><span>  of  interpretation  are  of  secondary</span><span>  importance  to  the  ratification  of</span><span>  the  agreement  and  can  be  thrashed</span><span>  out  afterwards.  Through  these*</span><span>  things  there  is  a  danger  of  months</span><span>  of  fruitful  negotiation  having  been</span><span>  lost,  and  the  whole  Indonesian  sit-</span><span>  uation  thrown  back  to  where  it</span><span>  was.  It  requires  no  more  than  a</span><span>  few  incidents  of  the  character  re-</span></p> <p><span>  ported  this  week  to  bring  about</span></p> <p><span>  such  a  state  of  affairs.</span></p> <p><span>  The  interests  of  Holland  and</span><span>  Indonesia  demand  that  there  shall</span><span>  be  no  more  fighting,  that  the  im-</span><span>  passe  over  the  agreement  shall  be</span><span>  overcome  and  the  earliest  possible</span><span>  start  made  with  the  building  of  the</span><span>  United  States  of  Indonesia,  in</span><span>  union  with  the  Netherlands,  as  is</span><span>  provided  for  in  the  agreement  that</span><span>  awaits  ratification.  The  real  cause</span><span>  of  the  drift  is  the  absence  of  that</span><span>  cooperative  attitude  on  the  crea-</span><span>  tion  of  which  so  much  time  and</span><span>  trouble  were  expended.  The  con-</span><span>  tinued  absence  of  a  cooperative  at-</span><span>  titude  will  play  into  the  hands  of</span><span>  the  extremists  in  Indonesia  and  the</span><span>  reactionaries  in  Holland  who  would,</span><span>  prefer  to  see  the  future  of  Indo-</span><span>  nesia  settled  not  by  negotiation  but</span><span>  hy  force  of  arms.</span></p> <p><span>  The  effect  of  the  present  situa-</span><span>  tion  on  a  large  section  of  the</span><span>  native  population  is  not  the  least</span><span>  of  the  reasons  why  things  should</span><span>  be  encouraged  to  settle  down  in</span><span>  this  greatly  disturbed  country.  As</span><span>  recently  as  this  week  Australian</span><span>  Press  correspondents  in  Java  de-</span><span>  scribed  harrowing  scenes  of  half</span></p> <p><span>  starved  native  men  and  women  and</span></p> <p><span>  children  seeking  Red  Cross  aid.</span><span>  Nothing  that  emerged  from  the</span><span>  Nazi  concentration  camps  of  Europe</span><span>  was  any  worse  than  the  emaciated</span><span>  human  beings  which  are  the  result</span><span>  of  two  year's  strife  in  what  was</span><span>  formerly  known  a8  one  of  the  most</span><span>  bountiful  lands  on  the  face  of  tho</span></p> <p><span>  earth.</span></p> <p><span>  Australia  may  consider  that,</span><span>  having  enough  troubles  of  her  own,</span><span>  she  can  remain  indifferent  to  the</span><span>  wranglings  of  the  Dutch  and  a</span><span>  former  subject  native  race.  We</span><span>  will  not  be  the  first  country  who</span><span>  has  taken  the  view  that  a  neigh-</span><span>  bour's  quarrel  ÍB  not  their</span><span>  concern,  only  to  find  out  how  gre</span><span>  yiously  mistaken  wo  were.  The</span></p> <p><span>  disturbances  in  Indonesia  is  no</span><span>  business  of  Australia  insofar  as  we</span><span>  can  take  any  practical  measures  to</span><span>  hasten  a  settlement.  But  it  is  a</span><span>  matter  of  concern  in  other  ways.</span><span>  Indonesia  is  one  of  the  near  neigh-</span><span>  bour  countries  which  Australia</span><span>  would  wish  to  see  politically  tran-  j</span><span>  quil  and  enjoying  a  peaceful,  pros-  j</span><span>  perous  development,  because  our  j</span></p> <p><span>  own  development  and  trade  ex-</span><span>  pansion  are  linked  therewith.  In</span><span>  addition,  there  is  the  tremendously</span><span>  important  aspect  of  a  mutual  de-</span><span>  fence  pact,  advantageous  to  both.</span></p> <p><span>  An  unsettled  neighbour  torn  .by</span><span>  civil  war  has  no  value  from  either</span><span>  a  commercial  or  defence  point  of</span><span>  view,  but  is  a  potential  source  of</span><span>  danger  in  the  latter  sense.  There</span><span>  is  little  that  Australia  can  do</span><span>  about  it  except  discourage  the  med-</span><span>  dlesome  interference  that  was  in-</span></p> <p><span>  troduced  into  NEI  affairs  last  year</span><span>  by  waterfront  elements,  and  to'</span></p> <p><span>  join  in  the  hope  that  now  that  I</span><span>  pointed  attention  has  been  directed</span><span>  to  the  danger  of  a  relapse  to  hos-</span><span>  tilities,  open  or  covert,  the  sane</span><span>  elements  of  both  Dutch  and  Indo-</span><span>  nesians  will  get  on  with  the</span></p> <p><span>  business  of  working  together.  j</span></p> ",Article,1947-03-21,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON FRIDAY, MARCH 21, 1947.

It  appears  that-not  un</span><span>  naturally-«ie  first  element  to</span></p> <p><span>  impress'itself  upon  folk  from  an  j</span><span>  English  climate  was  temperature,</span><span>  for  in  a  despatch  to  Viscount</span><span>  Castlereagh  dated  October  31,</span></p> <p><span>  1807  Governor  Bligh  included  the,</span><span>  temperatures  at  Sydney  over  the</span><span>  previous  months.  It  is  not  re-</span><span>  corded  what  His  Lordship  thought</span><span>  of  them,  nor  does  it  appear  that</span><span>  the  series  of  readings  was  con-</span></p> <p><span>  tinued.  ,  ...  i</span></p> <p><span>  Then  came  Governor  Brisbane  m  j</span><span>  1821,  whose  scientific  leanings  were</span><span>  so  well  known  to  Lord  Bathurst</span><span>  that  he  received  the  first  recom-</span><span>  mendation  of  the  appointment  with</span><span>  a  testy:  ""I  want  à  man  to  govern</span><span>  the  earth,  not  the  heavens.""

Bat  their  observa-</span><span>  tions  were  confined  to  rain  records,</span><span>  sind  in  the  same  year  rainfall  re</span><span>  cords  began  at  Melbourne,  Port</span><span>  Macquarie  and  Sydney.  This  was</span><span>  an  encouraging  beginning,  even</span><span>  though  it  took  shape  more  than</span><span>  half  a  century  after  the  first  es-</span><span>  tablishment  of  white  settlement  in</span><span>  Australia,  but  after  all  it  got  no</span></p> <p><span>  farther  than  the  measurement  of</span><span>  rainfall.

It</span><span>  is  also  a  reflex.of  the  mounting</span><span>  cost  of  goods.  The  average  work</span><span>  ing  person  cannot  afford.  to  pay</span><span>  cash  and  is  restoring  to  the  time</span><span>  payment  facilities  offered  by  the</span><span>  cash  order  syBtem.

He  asks</span><span>  for  them.  It  has  been  said  that</span><span>  the  best  way  to  losei  the  whole</span><span>  atmosphere  and  purport  of  a  book</span></p> <p><span>  is  to  have  it  translated  into  an-</span></p> <p><span>  other  language,  and  if  any  trace</span><span>  of  it  remains,  to  have  it  re-trans-</span><span>  lated  into  the  original  tongue.</span></p> <p><span>  After  all,  this  is  really  not  sur-</span><span>  prising.  The  author  strives  through</span><span>  the  wizardry  of  his  mother  tongue</span><span>  to  infe>v*et  in  pron  linea  of  words</span><span>  the  spasmodic  creations  of  bis</span><span>  brain,  fi«  starts  with  an  idea  ona</span><span>  ends  with  platoons  of  words,</span><span>  where  the  translator  starts  with.</span><span>  the  platoons  of  words  and  ends</span><span>  with  something  that  reads  like  the</span><span>  wrong  side  of  a  Turkish  tapestry</span><span>  Even  discounting  the  pitfalls  and</span><span>  vagaries  of  the  English  language,</span><span>  the  translator  who  tries  to  create</span><span>  in  French  the  impression  he  got</span><span>  from  an  English  work  should  take</span><span>  caution  as  his  guide  and  arrange</span><span>  for  sympathetic  stretcher  bearers</span><span>  at  the  end  of  the  road.  He</span><span>  would  also  show  consideration  for</span><span>  human  tribulation-not  to  mention</span><span>  discretion  in  his  own  well-being</span><span>  did  he  await  the  decease  of  the</span><span>  author  ere  he  started  his  fell  work.</span></p> <p><span>  Maybe  because  the  wella  ox</span><span>  human  optimism  are  never  dry,  the</span><span>  number  of  people  who  believe  most</span><span>  ardently  in  their  ability  to  undef</span></p> <p><span>  take  tais  most  exacting  work  is</span><span>  legion,  while  the-  number  who  have</span><span>  not  been  overwhelmed  with  despair</span><span>  at  their  abyssmal  failure  is  small</span><span>  indeed.  There  exists  no  greater</span><span>  fallacy  than,  that  mere  knowledge</span><span>  of  &  fjrretgn  language  is  aU-suffiei</span><span>  ert  for  successful  translations.  The</span><span>  first  essential  is  .to,  be  able  to  write</span><span>  one's  own  language,  the  next  is  a</span><span>  thorough  grip  of  either  the  plot</span><span>  if  a  novel-br  the  principie»  with</span><span>  which  the  .work  deals,  and  the  next</span><span>  is  a  peoiliar'quality  or  detachment</span></p> <p><span>  which  enables'one  to  write  another</span><span>  mair's  book  and  preserve  his  style</span><span>  and  colour.  Many  translations  fail</span><span>  because  they  end  in  the  book  be-</span><span>  coming  more  a  work  of  the  trans-</span><span>  lator  than  of  its  author.  It  is  this</span><span>  element,  no  doubt,  which  gave  rise</span><span>  to'  the  Italian  phrase  that  transla-</span><span>  tor  is  another  name  for  traitor.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  a  tribute  to  the  rising  stan-</span><span>  dard  of  literature  in  British  coun-</span><span>  tries*  that'  the  quality  of  transla-</span><span>  tions  from  foreign  languages  into</span><span>  ?  English  has  improved  considerably</span></p> <p><span>  during  the  past  half  century.  It</span><span>  abo  demonstrates  the  soundness  of</span><span>  the  lille  that,  with  very  few  ex-</span><span>  ceptions,  translations  should  al-</span><span>  ways  be  into  the  mother  tongue</span><span>  of  the.  translator.  An  instance  of</span><span>  the  latter  was  the  pretty  confusion</span><span>  of  the  French  teacher  of  English</span><span>  at  the  University  at  Tunis  who</span><span>  invited  guests  to  lunch  with:</span></p> <p><span>  ""Come  and  take  some  erubs.**  On</span></p> <p><span>  being  tactfully  reminded  that  sin-</span><span>  gular  or  plural  made  a  world  of</span><span>  difference  in  the  sense  of  the  slang</span><span>  use  of  the  word,  grub:  ""Ah-  Of</span><span>  course,""  she  laughed  in  intense</span><span>  relief.  ""Your  barbarous  English.  1</span><span>  should  have  said  maggot.""</span></p> <p><span>  But  the  reverse  process  is  les«</span><span>  happy,  and  the  very  heavy  demand</span><span>  in  Portugal  and  Spain  for  trans-</span><span>  lations  oí  .RmglfoTh  works  from  thal</span><span>  language  vastly  exceeds  the  num-</span><span>  ber  and  quality  .of  available  trans</span><span>  latón.  The  result  has  been  no  lest</span><span>  astonishing  to  Portuguese  anc</span><span>  Spanish  readers  than  it  has  beer</span><span>  disconcerting  to  English  writers</span><span>  Por  instance,  the  author  wrote:  ""à</span><span>  girl  with  a  face  like  that  coule</span><span>  get  away  with  murder/'  but  th«</span><span>  translator  mystified.  Spanish  read</span><span>  era  with:  ""A  girl  with  a  face  Uk«</span><span>  that  had  to  travel  -with  a  murder</span><span>  er.""  Another  gentle  character,  de</span><span>  scribed  by  the  author  as  havinj</span><span>  ""the  run  of  the  village""  is  depictec</span><span>  to  approving  Portuguese  reader</span><span>  as  ""drinking  all  the  village's  rum.1</span><span>  Everybody  in  a  country  of  lighl</span><span>  wines  knows  the  insatiable  passioi</span><span>  of  the  English  for  rum.  Then  i</span><span>  translator  of  technical  works  sail</span><span>  of  a  patient  whom  the  author  de</span><span>  scribed  as  ""fit  only  r  for  Ugh</span><span>  work,""  that  he  was  ""fit  only  fo</span><span>  work  by  artificial  light.""

After  all,  that  is  a  matt«</span><span>  between  author  and  translator,  ac</span><span>  not  between  rival  translators.  ]</span></p> <p><span>  I  also  points  to  yet  another  form  &lt;</span><span>  [  censorship,  of  which  most  countrii</span><span>  have  more:  than  enough  airead</span><span>  and  in  any  case  only  a  very  weec</span><span>  culture  exists  under  any  form  &lt;</span><span>  literary  censorship  that  is  n</span><span>  based  upon  informed,  free  pub!</span></p> <p><span>  opinion.  -  '</span></p> <p><span>  Another  inspired  thought  wi</span><span>  that  translators  should  be  ad</span><span>  quately  paid,  and  their  rewa</span><span>  should  take  precedence  over  th</span><span>  of  the  author.

But  public  fai</span><span>  is  a  fleeting  thing  prone  neitl</span><span>  to  thrive  on  a  diet  of  stemmy  ch</span><span>  grown  on  unredeemed  promises</span><span>  the  past,  nor  to  be  dazzled  by  ni</span><span>  chum  gold  used  to  burnish  tb</span><span>  of  the  future.

Extolling  at  Ye</span><span>  poon  the'  ardency  of  Labour's  d</span><span>  centralising  policy  he  went  to  tl</span><span>  dairying  industry  in  the  Daws«</span><span>  Valley  to  draw  his  parable,</span></p> <p><span>  seemed  odd  to  him,  apparent!,</span><span>  that  dairy  cows  should  be  fian</span><span>  in  rural  surroundings  and  not  i</span><span>  Brisbane  which  Labour's  deed</span><span>  tralisation  policy  has  packed  wh</span><span>  71  out  of  every  100  of  Queensland'</span><span>  increased  population  between  193</span><span>  and  1944.  The  subtlety  of  Mr  Lai</span><span>  combe's  humour  lies  in  the  fae</span><span>  that  the  average  increase  of  popi</span><span>  lation  in  Brisbane  was  -2.55  pe</span><span>  cent  per  annum,  and  that  for  th</span><span>  rest  of  Queensland  was  û-47  pe</span><span>  cent  per  annum!  Nor  will  the  haj</span><span>  less  Mr  Foley  thank  his  Divisiona</span><span>  Trainer  for  picking  hie  electorat</span><span>  -which  lies  largely  in  Dawsoi</span><span>  Valley  -  for  a  demonstration  o</span><span>  Labour's  decentralisation,  becaus</span><span>  there  are  1499  fewer  electors  oi</span><span>  the  roll  in  Normanby  for  thi</span><span>  election  (  than  there  were  thre</span><span>  years  ago.  Despite  this,  however</span><span>  Mr  Larcombe  showed  that  dair;</span><span>  production  had  increased  out  a</span><span>  sight,  though'  his  sorry  follower</span><span>  are  wondering,  no  doubt,  why  h&lt;</span><span>  selected  for  illustration  of  hi</span><span>  theme  the  industry  which  require</span><span>  the  dairyman's  wife  and  childrei</span><span>  to  bear  a  hand  so  that  betweei</span></p> <p><span>  the  whole  of  them  they  may  raak«</span><span>  the  basic  wage  for  one.  His  fol</span><span>  lowers  know,  as  does  Mr  Larcombe</span><span>  that  none  of  them  would  survivi</span><span>  the  attempt  to  establish  a  like</span><span>  principle  in  the  Trades  Hall.</span></p> <p><span>  A  strange  medley  of  colour«  in</span></p> <p><span>  dicates  runners  from  the  Franl</span><span>  Barnes  Labour  Party  stable,  and</span><span>  a  stranger  medley  of  claims</span><span>  charges,  denunciations  and  proies</span><span>  «ions  of  faith  purports  to  inform</span><span>  electors  whence  came  this  stable</span></p> <p><span>  and  whither  it  is  going.  The  ""of-</span><span>  ficial  platform  is  based  on  the  real</span><span>  Labour  principles  of  the  Hon.

Further</span><span>  doubt  arises  out  of  the  leader  of</span><span>  this  new  star  on  the  political</span><span>  firmament  announcing,  per  policy,</span><span>  ""It  is  recognised  that  the  Federal</span><span>  Parliament  has  control  over  bank-</span><span>  ing,  credit  and  currency,""  and  his</span><span>  first  disciple  in  this  district  (Mr</span><span>  Harding)  assuring  a  ""Bulletin""</span><span>  correspondent  on  the  28th  ultimo</span><span>  that  ""monetary  reform  can  be  put</span><span>  into  action  by  a  sovereign  State</span><span>  like  Queensland.""  Both  leader  and</span><span>  disciple  cannot  be  right.  Either</span><span>  a  sovereign  State  has  or  has  not</span><span>  constitutional  power  to  do  a  cer-</span><span>  tain  thing,  and  nothing  short  of</span><span>  a  civil  war  or  *a  change  of  the  con-</span><span>  stitution  can  get  over  that.  The</span><span>  civil  war  is  most  unlikely,  but  even</span><span>  it  might  come  more  Teadily  than</span><span>  would  permission  of  the  other  five</span><span>  States  to  allow  the  Constitution  of</span><span>  the  Commonwealth  to  be  altered</span><span>  so  that  Mr-Harding  might  experi-</span><span>  ment  on  them  with  Douglas  Credit.</span></p> <p><span>  Incidentally,  selling  the  Douglas</span><span>  Credit  idea  is  not  what  it  was.</span></p> <p><span>  'and  with  banks  cramniorl  with,</span><span>  paper  money  available  to  tni'Jions</span><span>  of  depositors  on  demand,  ii  U  ""ike</span><span>  trying  to  sell  refrigerator  spacp</span><span>  at  the  South  Pole.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  AUGUST  12,  1947.</span></p> <p><span>  ST  CHRISTOPHER'S</span></p> <p><span>  Forty-five  years  ago  a  preacher</span><span>  in  a  little  church  at  Benicia,  an</span><span>  arsenal,  grain-loading  city  at  tje</span><span>  mouth  of  the  Sacramento  River</span><span>  near  San  Francisco,  U.S.A.,  took</span><span>  for  his  test  the  theme  from  the</span><span>  Book  of  the  Prophet  Ezekiel  :  i.e.,</span><span>  the  story  of  the  dry  bones  that</span><span>  were  made  to  live.  The  back-</span><span>  ground  to  the  preacher  and  pulpit,</span><span>  the  towering  masts  and  yards,</span><span>  carrying  a  tracery  of  cordage  and</span><span>  spars,  of  a  great  ship  at  the  load-</span><span>  ing  berth,  was  suggestive  of  a</span><span>  waiting  force  to  carry  the  message</span><span>  over  tempestuous  waters  to  the</span><span>  uttermost  parts  of  the earth.</span></p> <p><span>  Remote  as  it  may  seem,  there</span><span>  was  a  distinct  link  between  that</span><span>  preacher  and  that  ship  and  the</span><span>  preacher  at  St  Christopher's</span><span>  Chapel  on  Sunday  last,  where  part</span><span>  of  the  background  was  a  two-</span><span>  stranded  wire  which  carried  to</span><span>  Brisbane  the  audible  part  of  the</span><span>  service  and  all  its  implications,</span><span>  there  to  be  converted  by  the</span><span>  wizardry  of  science  on  to  a  disc</span><span>  that  will  be  flown  to  America  for</span><span>  broadcasting  there.  Methods  have</span><span>  changed,  but  not  the  purpose  to</span><span>  spread  far  and  wide  a  spiritual</span><span>  message.  The  Divine  truth  came</span><span>  to  Ezekiel  in  '  ""the  valley  that</span><span>  was-full  of  bones"";  that  emanat-</span><span>  ing  from  St  Christopher's  sprang</span><span>  from  amidst  a  collection  of  relics</span><span>  which,  to  but  a  few  moments  pre-</span><span>  viously,  had  been  merely  inert</span><span>  matter  crumbling  under  the erod-</span><span>  ing  fingers  of  Time.  The  sub-</span><span>  stance  of  dead  things  was  different,</span><span>  but  the  revivifying  force  was</span><span>  still  the  same.  Years  have  sped</span><span>  on,  but  the  gospel  enunciated  by</span><span>  the  Prophet  Ezekiel,  by  the  name-</span><span>  less  preacher  in  the  little  church</span><span>  at  Benicia  45  years  ago,  and  by</span><span>  Rev.  Stewart  Lang  in  St  Chris-</span><span>  topher's  Chapel  two  days  ago  has</span></p> <p><span>  altered  not  at  all.</span></p> <p><span>  There  may  be  many  interpreta-</span><span>  tions,  but  no  changes  in enduring</span><span>  truths  on  which  is  based  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  Christian  faith,  nor  does  it  matter  &nbsp;</span><span>  greatly  what  is  the  interpretation</span><span>  if  the  enduring  truth  lies  at  the</span><span>  end.  But  there  can  be  many  im-</span></p> <p><span>  plications  which  are  brought  to  &nbsp;</span><span>  life  by  the  faith  and  constancy  of</span><span>  man.  It  was  Ezekiel's  faith  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  which  brought  a  new  and  wider  &nbsp;</span><span>  life  to  men  who  were  dead  spiri-</span><span>  tually;  it  will  be  the  spiritual</span><span>  faith  of  people  of  all  denomina-</span></p> <p><span>  tions  that  will  breathe  '  life  '  into  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  Nerimbera  relic.  Without</span><span>  that  spiritual  faith  St  Chris-  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  topher's  Chapel  will  disintegrate</span><span>  and  mingle  with  the  forest  litter;</span><span>  with  that  faith  it  can  become  a</span><span>  place  of  mental  pilgrimage  to</span><span>  many  thousands  of  American</span><span>  people  who  sent  their  sons  and</span><span>  daughters  that  we  might  remain</span><span>  free.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  St  .  Christopher's  Chapel  is  no</span><span>  relic,  of  U.SJA.  army  law  or</span><span>  organisation,  was  no  part  of  offi-</span><span>  cial  plans  for  the  preparation  of</span><span>  America's  -sons  for  an  impending</span><span>  ordeal.  But  it  is  maybe  the  most</span><span>  powerful  of  all  mementoes  that</span><span>  might  have  been  left  as  the</span><span>  American  armies  marched  away  to</span><span>  carry  defeat  -to  the  homeland  of  the</span><span>  enemy,:  because  it  is  in  fact  a</span><span>  memento  of  the  voluntary  spiri-</span><span>  tual  preparation  made  by  free</span><span>  men  who  came  to  our  rescue.  Many</span><span>  of  those  men  were  about  to  give</span><span>  their  lives,  as  our  men  gave-theirs,</span><span>  in  the  service  of  the  Christian</span><span>  faith.  It  is  thus  in  two  senses  a</span><span>  sacred  trust  that  we  hold  :  one</span></p> <p><span>  so  that  our  posterity  may  know</span><span>  the  quality  -  of  American  service</span><span>  personnel  who  fought  beside  that</span><span>  of  Australia  to  beat  hack  the  on-</span><span>  coming  Japanese  invader  ;  and</span><span>  one  as  an  earnest  to  our  English</span><span>  speaking  American  cousins  that</span><span>  we  share  their  memories  and  are</span><span>  1  not  unmindful  of  their  sacrifices.</span></p> <p><span>  A  succession  of  like  commemor-</span><span>  ative  observances,  to  that  held  on</span><span>  i  Sunday  last,  will  each  build  up  its</span></p> <p><span>  section  of  spiritual  remem-</span><span>  brance,  and  will  go  forth  as  an</span><span>  earnest  that  we  in  this  district  do</span><span>  not  forget.  Making  the  most  of</span><span>  'our  limitations  we  may  do  no</span><span>  I  more  ;  and  if  we  are  to  face  un-</span></p> <p><span>  afraid  the  judgement  of  history</span></p> <p><span>  we  dare  not.  do  less.  .</span></p> ",Article,1947-08-12,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON TUESDAY, AUGUST 12, 1947.

When  toys  .had  to  be</span><span>  handled  with  extreme  care  if  they</span><span>  were  tc  survive  many  play  hours,</span><span>  the  spirit  of  toydom  was  a  colour-</span><span>  less,  inert  thing,  and  it  is  not  re-</span><span>  markable  '  that  evolution  of  the</span><span>  unbreakable  doll  and  the  ""build</span><span>  your  own""  toys  carried  unqualified</span><span>  satisfaction  .  among  millions  of</span><span>  very  important  people.</span></p> <p><span>  Notwithstanding  this,  however,</span><span>  the  transition  was  not  a  rapid  one,</span><span>  in.  the  main  because  educators</span><span>  wanted  to  cram  too  much  of  the</span><span>  class-room  into  the  designs,  so</span><span>  that  manufacturers  were  often  left;</span><span>  with  stacks  of  impractical  toye  on</span><span>  their  shelves.  In  their  turn  manu-</span><span>  facturers  became  suspicious  of</span><span>  things  tagged  educational,  and  it</span></p> <p><span>  was  Borne  time  ere  manufacturers</span><span>  and  teachers  mastered  lessons  in</span></p> <p><span>  adaptability  and  realised  that  they</span></p> <p><span>  had  much  in  common.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON  j</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  MAY  14,  1947.  ¡</span></p> <p><span>  PRICE  EQUILIBRIUM</span></p> <p><span>  On  October  31  last  tue  United</span><span>  States  abolished  1642  local  price</span><span>  control  'boards,  more  than  10,000</span><span>  price-control  employees  went  off  the</span><span>  public  pay  roll/  and  less  than  40  per</span></p> <p><span>  cent  of  USA  manufacturers  were</span></p> <p><span>  left  under  any  kind  of  control.  On</span><span>  December  5  the  head  of  the  prices</span><span>  organisation  moved  out  of  the  third</span><span>  floor  of  the  Empire  Building  and  an  ;</span><span>  lanny  atomic  bomb  group  moved  in.</span></p> <p><span>  Canberra  comment  on  this  develop-</span><span>  ment  was  to  the  effect  that  atomic</span><span>  power  would  be  needed  to  keep  pace</span><span>  with  ascending  prices.</span></p> <p><span>  But  there  is  more  to  curbing  in-  '</span><span>  nation  than  throttling  the  patient,  :</span><span>  which  is  the  Canberra  specific  for</span></p> <p><span>  ¡this  malady.  That  is  to  say,  there  j</span><span>  ?  is  much  to  be  said  for  easing  the  j</span><span>  j  safety  valve  as  against  sitting  on</span><span>  j  it.  It  brings  into  play  more  factors</span><span>  that  may  tend  to  spread  the  trouble</span><span>  and  60  disperse  it.  Sitting  on  the</span><span>  safety  valve  not  only  is  a  check</span><span>  upon  spending,  but  it  throttles  pro-</span><span>  duction  and  piles  up  unsatisfied</span><span>  wants.  It  makes  goods  scarce  and'</span><span>  brings  joy  to  the  black  marketeer.</span><span>  On  the  other  hand,  the  greatest</span></p> <p><span>  check  against  rising  prices  is  pleni-</span><span>  tude  of  goods  and  the  black  mar-</span><span>  keteer  is  starved  out  of  existence.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  not  always  quite  a6  easy  as</span><span>  that  in  practice,  because  demand  for.</span><span>  a  wide  range  of  different  goods  is</span><span>  not  always  the  same,  neither  is</span><span>  their  cost  of  production  nor  the</span><span>  manner  and  cost  of  their  distribu-</span><span>  tion.  But  in  principle  USA  followed</span><span>  the  policy  of  easing  the  safety</span><span>  valve,  because  very  many  of  these</span><span>  conflicting  influences  and  tendencies</span><span>  when  brought  into  the  open  can-</span><span>  celled  oPt  each  other  where  under</span><span>  close  restriction  they  remained</span><span>  open,  spreading  sores.  There  was</span><span>  for  a  time,  after  lifting  price  con-</span></p> <p><span>  trol,  more  ontcry  against  rising</span><span>  prices,  but  there  was  a  diminishing</span><span>  chorus  of  complaints  against  lack  of</span><span>  commodities.  Canberra  on  the  other</span><span>  hand  employs  ceilings  to  prevent</span><span>  runaway  prices,  but  the  effect  is  to</span><span>  create  bottle-necks  blocking  other</span><span>  production.  In  this  effort  to  avoid</span><span>  deflation  and  give  an  incentive  to</span><span>  labour  this  process  contributed  -</span><span>  and  still  contributes-to  wage-price</span><span>  inflation,  and  in  the  effort  to  cush-</span><span>  ion  unemployment  Canberra  has  a</span><span>  firm  belief  in  subsidies  on  not  work-</span><span>  ing.</span></p> <p><span>  With  the  lifting  of  price  controls</span><span>  in  USA  there  was  an  upward  rush</span><span>  of  prices,  when  a  great  many</span><span>  prophets  believed  their  worst  fore-</span><span>  cast  would  be  overwhelmed  by  the</span><span>  rising  tide.  But  the  rush  ran  into</span><span>  full  delivery  pipe  lines  of  commodi-</span><span>  ties  and  eager  competition,  and  the</span><span>  price  curve  started  to  flatten  out.</span><span>  This  was  intensified  by  the  fact</span><span>  that  when  towering  prices  put-one</span><span>  commodity  out  of  reach  there  w&lt;as</span><span>  always  another  at  lower  price  to</span><span>  meet  the  demand.  That  is  not  to</span><span>  say  that  these  powerful  inflationary</span><span>  conditions,  confronting  the  free</span><span>  countries  of  the  world,  always</span><span>  stopped  at  precisely  the  right  point</span><span>  where  things  were  corrected  with-</span><span>  out  hurting  someone.  The  move-</span><span>  ment  was  too  vast  for  exact  blue-</span></p> <p><span>  print  planning,  but  the  simple  fact</span><span>  was  that  ere  the  end  of  the  year</span><span>  the  economic  problems  of  USA  were</span><span>  at  least  within  the  scope  of  USA</span><span>  folk  to  control  them.  There  was  no</span></p> <p><span>  runaway  inflation,  and  the  increase</span><span>  in  wages  was  well  above  the  price</span></p> <p><span>  increase.</span></p> <p><span>  A  joint  House-Senate  Committee</span><span>  on  the  Economic  Report  hag  now</span><span>  announced  that  it  is  about  to  in-</span><span>  quire  into  the  prevailing  prices  for</span><span>  consumer  goods  and  industrial  pro-</span><span>  ducts.  It  has  sent  out  questionnaires</span><span>  to.  folk  in  every  walk  in  life,  but</span><span>  in  the  meantime  is  looking  over</span><span>  some  stabilising  factors  now  that</span><span>  price  control  operates  only  over</span><span>  rents,  rice  and  sugar.  The  first  of</span><span>  these  is  the  USA  Treasury,  which</span><span>  is  retiring  each  week  about  £66,</span><span>  000,000  of  government  securities,</span><span>  and  is  otherwise  taking  steps  to</span><span>  lower  the  ""public  debt.  That,  inci-</span><span>  dentally,  is  going  on  too  in</span><span>  Australia,  there  being  a  drop</span><span>  of  £122,000,000  .  in  the  volume</span><span>  of  Treasury  Bills  held  at  the</span><span>  end  of  February  last  as  com-</span><span>  pared  with  the  amount  a  year</span><span>  earlier.  Another  USA  precaution</span><span>  against  unstable  buying  applies  to</span><span>  15  major  durable  goods  ranging</span><span>  from  refrigerators  to  motor  cars.  On</span><span>  such  goods  consumers  are  compelled</span><span>  at  the  outset  to  make  a  cash  pay-</span><span>  ment  of  one-third  of  the  purchase</span><span>  price,  and  the  balance  must  be  paid</span></p> <p><span>  off  in  15  months.</span></p> <p><span>  An  even  stronger  factor  is  Presi-</span><span>  dent  Truman's  recent  statement</span></p> <p><span>  that,  having  abandoned  price  control</span><span>  and  limited  its  action  to  ""moral</span><span>  suasion,""  the  Government  is  en-</span><span>  titled  now  to  look  for  manufactur-</span><span>  ers  and  distributors  to  make  a  con-</span><span>  tribution  by  cutting  prices.  At  the</span><span>  same  time  he  said  that  care  had  to</span><span>  be  taken  to  avoid  a  price  war</span><span>  which  would  bring  them  into  con</span><span>  flict  with  anti-trust  laws.  He</span><span>  warned  them  that  the  alternative</span><span>  would  be  goods  pouring  from  Amer-</span><span>  ican  factories  in  so  great  a  flow</span><span>  that  they  would  commence  to  ""back</span><span>  up  in  clearance  sales,  inventory  pile-</span><span>  ups  and  occasional  factory  shut-</span><span>  downs""  often  because  high  prices</span><span>  kept  goods  from  moving  out  into</span><span>  consumption.  Truman  said  it  is  en-</span><span>  couraging  that  on  a  higher  level  of</span><span>  output  and  prices  a  peacetime</span><span>  economy  had  been  largely  restored</span><span>  after  1$  years  of  reconversion.</span><span>  Finally,  to  sweeten  generally  the</span></p> <p><span>  temper  of  wage-earners  and  wage-,</span><span>  payers,  of  consumers  and  of  pro-</span><span>  ducers  there  is  to  be  a  generous  tax</span><span>  cut  of  over  £1,000,000/10.</span></p> <p><span>  There  are  many  bewildering  un-</span><span>  certainties,  of  course,  in  which</span><span>  many  economic  observers  delight  to</span><span>  enfold  themselves.

That  is  on</span><span>  glorious  winter  sunshine,  to  sa</span><span>  nothing  of  additional  boufliteov.</span><span>  gifts  in  endless  miles  of  sal</span><span>  bathing  beach,  well  stocked  fis!</span><span>  ing  grounds  and  innumerab]</span></p> <p><span>  islands  that  lend  themselves  t</span><span>  habitation.</span></p> <p><span>  But  there  requires  to  be  som&lt;</span><span>  thing  more  than  the  things  s</span><span>  lavishly  provided  by  Nature.  Ma</span><span>  does  not  live  by  bread  alone,  an</span><span>  the  southern  holiday  maker  wi!</span><span>  not  enjoy  a  winter  visit  to  Queeni</span><span>  land  if  he  finds  nothing  but  sui</span><span>  shine  and  safe  bathing  beachei</span><span>  Nor  will  his  cup  be  filled  if  th</span><span>  most  elaborate  sporting  fixture</span><span>  are  scheduled  for  his  beguilement</span><span>  Only  last  week  there  was  som</span><span>  very  terse  criticism  of  the  accom</span><span>  modation  arranged  for  a  party  o</span><span>  interstate  tourists  who  had  to  sta;</span><span>  overnight  in  Brisbane  on  thei</span><span>  way  to  one  of  the  northern  islam</span><span>  resorts.  No  hot  meal  awaited  them</span><span>  the  bed  linen  was  such  that  the;</span><span>  preferred  to  sleep  in  their  owl</span><span>  travelling  rugs,  and  they  wer&lt;</span></p> <p><span>  told  there  was  no  one  to  call  then</span><span>  in  time  to  catch  the  early  morn</span><span>  ing  plane  to  take  them  to  theil</span></p> <p><span>  destination.  This  was  no  ""doss</span><span>  house""  into  which  they  had  chance&lt;</span><span>  by  accident,  but  was  the  régulai</span><span>  accommodation  recommended  by  th</span></p> <p><span>  Tourist  Bureau  officer  who  booker</span><span>  them  up.  This  batch  of  tourists  al</span><span>  all  events  were  more  concerne*</span><span>  with  clean  sheets  than  with  addi</span><span>  tional  sport  fixtures.</span></p> <p><span>  Let  the  Premier  convene  his  con</span><span>  ference  hy  all  means,  but  it  shoulc</span><span>  be  open  to  the  widest  representa</span><span>  tion,  and  not  confined  to  Brisbant</span><span>  interests  only,  since  they  are  un</span><span>  likely  to  concern  themselves  wit!</span><span>  anything  that  is  not  of  benefit  tc</span></p> <p><span>  the  southern  resorts.  Central  anc</span></p> <p><span>  North  Queensland  are  as  deeplj</span><span>  interested  in  bringing  southerr</span><span>  visitors  to  the  State,  more  so  per</span><span>  haps  than  Brisbane  since  thpj</span><span>  have  more  to  offer.'  Their  problem</span><span>  involves  something  more  than  ad</span><span>  ditional  sport  fixtures.  One  of  thc</span><span>  first  things  it  involves  is  the  de-</span><span>  velopment  of  roads,  so  that  motor-</span><span>  ists  can  travel  to  their  holiday</span><span>  resorts  with  speed  and  comfort.</span><span>  In  that  case  the  Main  Roads  Com-</span><span>  mission  should  be  given  a  front</span><span>  seat  at  the  conference.  Â  second</span><span>  important  consideration  is  that  of</span><span>  accommodation,  and  the  licensing,</span><span>  health  and  other  appropriate  auth</span><span>  I  orities  should  be  there  to  advise</span><span>  on  minimum  requirements.  If  the</span><span>  southern  visitor  is  catered  for  in</span><span>  these  matters  he  is  not  likely  to</span><span>  complain  of  any  slight  inade-</span><span>  quacies  in  the  sport  Urogramme.</span></p> <p><span>  One  thing  the  proposed  confer-</span><span>  ence  should  do  is  to  wake  up  Cen-</span><span>  tral  and  Northern  centres  to  seeing</span><span>  that  their  own  houses  are  in  order.</span><span>  This  applies  particularly  to  Rock-</span><span>  hampton.  Almost  every  week  we</span><span>  read  of  parties  of  schoolboys  and</span><span>  others  passing  through  this  city</span><span>  either  going  to  or  returning  from</span><span>  one  of  the  islands  in  the  north.</span></p> <p><span>  They  have  gone  there  because  of</span><span>  the  facilities  for  travel  by  launch</span><span>  and  of  accommodation  .  Off  our</span><span>  own  coast  are  numerous  islands</span></p> <p><span>  equal  to  any  and  superior  to  most,</span><span>  but  lacking  accommodation  for</span><span>  holiday  makers,  and  accessible</span><span>  only  at  certain  states  of  the  tide</span><span>  due  to  the  absence  of  landing</span><span>  facilities  even  on  the  mainland.</span><span>  From  time  to  time  the  question</span><span>  of  a  suitable  anchorage  and  land</span><span>  stage  crops  up,  becomes  the</span><span>  subject  of  a  report  by  a  Marine</span><span>  Department  officer,  and  then  lapses</span><span>  for  a  further  term.</span></p> <p><span>  Last  week  a  seven-day  tourist</span><span>  coach  service  was  inaugurated</span><span>  between  Brisbane  and  Bundaberg</span><span>  (via  Toowoomba),  returning  via</span><span>  Maryborough  and  Gympie.  AU  the</span><span>  points  visited  realised  the  com-</span><span>  mercial  value  of  the  enterprise  and</span><span>  they  accorded  the  visitors  civic  re-</span><span>  ceptions  and  showed  them  every-</span><span>  thing  they  had,  from  peanut</span><span>  pilos  to  cane  crushing.  Given</span><span>  the  roads  a  tourist  coach  itiner-</span><span>  ary  could  be  arranged  to  Rock-</span><span>  hampton,  traversing  the  inland</span><span>  route  one  way  and  the  coast  road</span><span>  on  the  return  trip.  A  live  local</span><span>  tourist  body  could  be  already</span><span>  mapping  out  an  itinerary  and  en-</span><span>  deavouring  to  interest  one  of  the</span><span>  tourist  travel  agencies.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  meantime  the  import-</span><span>  ant  question  of  the  incorporation</span><span>  of  the  nearby  seaside  resorts  into</span><span>  a  Greater  Rockhampton  in  orfler</span><span>  to  ensure  the  early  acquisition  of</span><span>  electricity,  water  supply  and</span><span>  sewerage  is  shelved  because  it  is</span><span>  no  one's  business  to  take  the  in-</span><span>  itiative  to  have  the  matter  de-</span><span>  cided  one  way  or  the  other.  Whilst</span><span>  Central  Queensland  adopts  this</span></p> <p><span>  dilatory  attitude  we  will  continue</span><span>  to  read  of  tourist  parties  going</span><span>  north  and  of  conferences  being</span></p> <p><span>  convened  to  make  South  Queens-  i</span><span>  land  resorts  a  winter  playground  I</span><span>  for  southern  visitors.</span></p> ",Article,1947-05-23,The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON MAY 23 1947....

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  FEBRUARY  1,  1947</span></p> <p><span>  GLADSTONE'S  CENTENARY</span></p> <p><span>  This  is  centenary  week  at  Glad-</span><span>  stone.  One  hundred  years  ago  on</span><span>  Friday  last  Colonel  Barney  landed</span><span>  with  his  staff  on  Settlement  Point,</span></p> <p><span>  Facing  Island,  from  the  stranded</span><span>  barque  Lord  Auckland,  the  swear-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  in  ceremony  which  created  the</span><span>  colony  of  North  Australia  and</span><span>  Barney  to  be  Commandant  of  it</span></p> <p><span>  took  place,  and  a  Legislative  As-</span></p> <p><span>  sembly was  formed. The colony</span></p> <p><span>    &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  of  North  Australia  was  to  include</span><span>  all  land  north  of  the  26th  parallel</span><span>  of  latitude,  which  parallel  runs</span><span>  through  Double  Island  Point  and</span><span>  Theebine  railway  station.</span></p> <p><span>  But  Gladstone  goes  back  in</span><span>  Australian  history  much  farther</span><span>  than  that.  It  emerged  from  the</span><span>  list  of  unknown  lands  on  August</span><span>  5,  1802,  on  which  day  Flinders</span><span>  discovered  and  entered  the  port.</span><span>  He  had  already  named  Mt  Larcom</span><span>  ""in  compliment  to  Captain  Larcom</span><span>  of  the  Navy,""  and  he  named  his</span><span>  new  discovery  Port  Curtis  in</span><span>  honour  of  Admiral  Sir  Roger  Cur-</span><span>  tis  who,  at  the  Cape  of  Good</span><span>  Hope,  ""had  been  so  attentive  to  &nbsp;</span><span>  our  wants.""  He  coined  a  word</span><span>  with  which  to  christen  Gatcombe</span><span>  Head,  i.e.,  gat,  an  opening  or  gap;</span><span>  and  combe,  a  valley  or  hollow  be-</span><span>  tween  two  hills.  Anyone  who  has</span><span>  seen  it  from  seaward  will  agree</span><span>  that  the  name  so  bestowed  ad-</span><span>  mirably  suited  the  view.  Flinders</span><span>  also  named  Facing  Island  ""which</span><span>  protects  it  (the  port)  from  the</span><span>  sea;""  Ship  Hill  and  South  Trees</span><span>  Point,  on  the  last-named  of  which</span><span>  there  stood  for  many  years  a  tree</span><span>  marked:  ""M.F.  August  5,  1802.""</span></p> <p><span>  ""Excepting  that  Flinders  entered</span><span>  Port  Curtis  from  Keppel  Bay  via</span><span>  the  Narrows  a  few  days  after</span><span>  leaving  to  ""prosecute  examination</span><span>  of  the  coast""  the  solitude  of  the</span><span>  new  port  remained  unbroken  by</span><span>  white  men  for  19  years.  The  next</span><span>  visitor  was  Oxley,  sent  by  Gover-</span><span>  nor  Brisbane  to  explore  Moreton</span><span>  Bay  and  Port  Curtis  as  likely</span></p> <p><span>  sites  for  a  new  settlement.  He</span><span>  arrived  in  Port  Curtis  on  Novem-</span><span>  ber  5,  1823  ""after  a  tedious  pas-</span><span>  sage""  and  applied  himself  at</span></p> <p><span>  once  to  examination  of  the  coun-</span></p> <p><span>  try,  in  the  course  of  which  he</span><span>  discovered  and  named  the  Boyne</span><span>  River,  but  does  not  appear  to</span><span>  have  bestowed  any  other  names</span><span>  that  have  survived.  After  16</span></p> <p><span>  days'  examination  Oxley  decided</span></p> <p><span>  that:</span></p> <p><span>  "".  .  taking  it  in  an  extended  sense,</span><span>  the  country  could  not  afford  sub-</span><span>  stance  to  or  supply  the  means  of</span><span>  profitable  labour  for  a  large estab-</span><span>  lishment,  and  even  one  on  the</span><span>  smallest  scale.""</span></p> <p><span>  That  report,  and  his  more  favour-</span><span>  able  one  on  Moreton  Bay,  rang</span><span>  down  the  curtain  on  Port  Curtis</span></p> <p><span>  for  another  23  years,  even  though</span></p> <p><span>  there  persisted  an  undercurrent  of</span><span>  speculation  regarding  the  source</span><span>  of  the  Boyne  River,  presumably</span><span>  as  to  the  possibility  of  it  drain-</span><span>  ing  good  pastoral  country.</span></p> <p><span>  In  December,  1845,  Mr  W.  E.</span><span>  Gladstone  became  Secretary  of</span><span>  State  for  the  Colonies,  and  at  once</span><span>  applied  himself  to  finding  some-</span><span>  where  to  send  convicts,  as  free  &nbsp;</span><span>  settlement  was  squeezing  out  the</span><span>  convict  settlement  in  New  South</span><span>  Wales  and  Tasmania.  On  avail-</span><span>  able  reports  he  selected  Port  Cur-</span><span>  tis,  and  chose  Colonel  George</span><span>  Barney  to  be  commandant  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  new  settlement  of  North  Aus-</span></p> <p><span>  tralia.  Barney  arrived  at  Sydney</span><span>  on  September  15,  1846,  and  pro-</span><span>  ceeded  almost  immediately  to  in-</span><span>  spect  his  kingdom,  while  the</span><span>  barque  Lord  Auckland  was  char-</span><span>  tered  at  the  rate  of  £1  per  ton</span><span>  per  calendar  month,  the  charter  to</span><span>  operate  from  November  15.</span></p> <p><span>  Ten  days  earlier  Earl  Grey,  who  &nbsp;</span><span>  had  succeeded  Gladstone,  wrote  to</span><span>  Governor  Fitzoy  instructing</span><span>  abandonment  of  the  project.  There  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  being  neither  cable  nor  wireless  in  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  those  days,  the  work  of  preparing</span></p> <p><span>  to  establish  the  new  settlement</span></p> <p><span>  went  forward  contemporaneously</span><span>  as  instructions  for  its  abolition</span><span>  dawdled  their  leisurely  way  from</span><span>  London  to  Sydney.  The  Lord</span><span>  Auckland  sailed  from  Sydney  with</span><span>  Barney  and  his  staff  on  January</span><span>  8,  1847,  and  there  being  no  such</span><span>  things  as  admiralty  charts  or</span><span>  channel  markings  in  those  days,</span><span>  she  ran  on  a  sand-bank  at  the</span><span>  entrance  to  Port  Curtis  on  the</span><span>  25th  idem,  and  it  was  from  here</span></p> <p><span>  that  the  official  party  landed  for</span><span>  the  historic  ceremony.  The  Lord</span><span>  Auckland  was  floated  off  on  Janu-</span><span>  ary  31,  and  for  many  years  the</span><span>  logs  of  the  improvised  grid  on  &nbsp;</span><span>  which  she  was  placed  for  repair</span></p> <p><span>  could  be  seen  on  the  bank  of</span><span>  Auckland  Creek.  On  February  26</span><span>  the  barque  Thomas  Lowry  sailed</span><span>  from  Port  Jackson  for  Port  Cur-</span><span>  tis,  carrying  several  more  families</span><span>  of  colonists  and  50  soldiers.</span></p> <p><span>  Establishment  of  the  new  settle-  &nbsp;</span><span>  ment  quickened  interest  in  the</span><span>  Boyne  River  and  its  source,  so</span><span>  Surveyor  J.  C.  Burnett  was  sent</span><span>  overland  from  Brisbane  on  March  &nbsp;</span><span>  1  to  try  to  clear  up  the  matter.</span><span>  He  failed  in  his  search,  and  was</span><span>  sent  out  again  in  April  with  no</span><span>  better  result  than  that  he  reached  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  present  Burnett  and  believed</span><span>  it  to  be  the  Boyne.  On  May19,  &nbsp;</span><span>  1847,  the  Thomas  Lowry  sailed</span><span>  from  Port  Curtis  with  the  per-</span></p> <p><span>  sonnel  of  the  short-lived  adminis-</span><span>  tration.  But  several  signposts  re-</span><span>  main.  Through  the  ship  Lord</span><span>  Auckland,  George  Eden,  Baron  of</span><span>  Auckland,  is  remembered  in  Auck-</span><span>  land  Creek,  Auckland  Hill  and</span><span>  Auckland  Point;  Barney  Point</span><span>  commemorates  Colonel  Barney  and</span><span>  Gladstone  commemorates  the  name</span><span>  of  its  founder.</span></p> <p><span>  Two  months  after  abandonment</span><span>  of  the  settlement  Burnett  left by</span><span>  sea  to  try  to  clear  up  the  Boyne-</span><span>  Burnett  riddle.  He  reached  and</span><span>  entered  Burnett  River  on  July  11,</span></p> <p><span>  and  in  the  words  of  Govenor</span></p> <p><span>  Fitzroy  he  established  that  the</span><span>  river  which  he  discovered  was</span><span>  ""not  identical  with  that  to  which</span><span>  the  name  of  Boyne  was  given  by</span><span>  Surveyor-General  Oxley.""  And  so</span><span>  Gladstone  became  a  name  long  be-</span><span>  fore  it  became  a  settled  place  of</span><span>  authority,  but  it  was  the  first</span></p> <p><span>  place  in  Queensland  outside  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  Brisbane  to  travel  even  that far</span></p> <p><span>  along  the  road  which  leads  to</span><span>  municipality  and  the  dignities</span><span>  which  such  state  confers.</span></p> ",Article,1947-02-01,"The morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1947  GLADSTONES CENTENARY",56416322,4,4,"{'score': '5305.823', 'value': 'very relevant'}","This is centenary week at Gladstone.

The  Governments</span><span>  are  well  aware  of  this  but  are</span><span>  afraid  to  make  any  serious  move</span><span>  to  eradicate  the  real  cause.  In</span><span>  fact,  «t  present  they  are  busy</span><span>  bringing  about  something  that  will</span><span>  aggravate  rather  ""than  remedy  the</span><span>  situation.

With-</span><span>  out  any  consultation  with  the  mine</span><span>  management  the  employees  at  a</span><span>  NSW  colliery  decided  that  the</span><span>  shot-firers  and  deputies  would  not</span><span>  erect  brattice.  As  a  consequence,</span><span>  the  mine  waa  idle  from  April  21et</span><span>  to  May  6th,  whereupon  the  depu-</span><span>  ties  demanded  payment  for  the.</span><span>  period  they  did  not  work.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  JUNE  20,  1947.</span></p> <p><span>  LAST  PHASE</span></p> <p><span>  With  but  two  days  to  go  the</span><span>  sands  are  rapidly  running  oat  for</span><span>  the  1047  Carnival.  The  uncertain-</span><span>  ties  concerning  the  weather  have</span><span>  been  resolved  and  the  week  prom-</span><span>  ises  to  end  in  a  blaze  of  that  glori-</span><span>  ous  sunshine  of  which  it  ia  our</span><span>  wont  to  boast.  To  be  sure  th«</span><span>  somewhat  prolonged  spell  of  fine</span><span>  weather  has  an  offset  in  the  dust</span></p> <p><span>  created  by  heavy  street  traffic.  A</span><span>  Bmart  overnight  shower  would  do</span><span>  the  world  of  good  in  this  matter,</span><span>  but  these  things  cannot  be  ordered,</span><span>  and  it  must  bc  conceded  that  the</span><span>  City  Council  Works  Department</span><span>  is  doing  much  to  ameliorate  the</span></p> <p><span>  conditions.</span></p> <p><span>  Carnival  week  has  entered  its</span></p> <p><span>  most  vital  phase  for  the  body  to</span></p> <p><span>  whom  it  means  most.  That  is  the</span></p> <p><span>  Agricultural  Society,  whose  annual</span></p> <p><span>  show  must  earn  the  revenue  neces-</span></p> <p><span>  sary  to  keep  the  organisation</span><span>  going  until  the  next  one  comes</span></p> <p><span>  round.  Attendances  thus  far  have</span><span>  been  satisfactory  without  threat-</span><span>  ening  to  make  fresh  records,  but</span><span>  it  is  today  and  tomorrow  that</span></p> <p><span>  will  tell  the  tale  at  the  turnstiles.</span></p> <p><span>  On  these  days  the  neighbouring</span><span>  towns  and  rural  settlements  pour</span><span>  in  their  thousands,  suggesting  that</span><span>  the  Rockhampton  Show  is  a  great-</span><span>  er  event  in  the  year  of  district</span><span>  residents  than  it  is  even  of  city</span><span>  folk.  Rural  residents  who  do  not</span><span>  come  to  the  city  excepting  at</span><span>  Christmas  time  manage  to  get</span><span>  here  for  the  Show.  The  experience</span><span>  brings  something  new  to  the</span><span>  routine  of  their  '  daily  lives  and</span><span>  they  return  home  with  much  to</span></p> <p><span>  relate  and  remember.  It  will  be</span><span>  hoped  they  will  not  go  back  with</span><span>  anything  of  which  to  complain.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  one  aspect  of  the  Car-</span><span>  nival  which  could  give  cause  for</span><span>  uneasiness;  that  is  the  catering</span><span>  arrangements  for  casual  callers.</span><span>  Under  the  rationing  system  no</span><span>  margin  is  allowed  for  the  demands</span><span>  created  by  a  large  influx  of  visi-</span><span>  to».  Some,  caterers  are  far-seeing</span><span>  enough  to  endeavour  to  make  the</span><span>  necessary  arrangement«  for  in-</span><span>  creased  supplies,  but  not  all  will</span><span>  go  to  that  trouble,  and  they  have</span><span>  no  qualms  about  announcing  that</span><span>  there  is  ""nothing  left.""  To  date</span><span>  no  complaint  has  been  made  that</span></p> <p><span>  the  facilities  for  casual  meals  are</span></p> <p><span>  inadequate,  but  a  different  experi-</span><span>  ence  could  be  related  today  and</span><span>  tomorrow  when  several  thousand</span><span>  more  people  will  look  to  be  fed.</span><span>  For  the  credit  of  .  Rockhampton</span><span>  and  for  the  sake  of  future  carni-</span><span>  vals  it  is  hoped  that  the  hotels</span><span>  and  refreshment  rooms  will  strain</span><span>  every  effort  to  meet  the  demands</span><span>  for  meals  from  country  visitors</span><span>  who  are-in  for  the  show.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Rockhampton  show  means</span></p> <p><span>  different  things  to  different  people,  ;</span><span>  but  to  the  juvenile  populace  it,</span><span>  means  only  one  thing-that  it  is  '</span><span>  the  greatest  event  of  the  year,</span><span>  always  excepting  Christmas.  It</span><span>  was  a  happy  idea,  as  well  as  a</span></p> <p><span>  shrewd  stroke  of  business  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  part  of  the  society  to  have  a  free</span><span>  day  for  children,  for  where  thc</span><span>  children  go  there  must  go  the  par-</span><span>  ents,  to  say  nothing  of  the</span><span>  aunts  and  possibly  the  uncles.</span><span>  The  result  is  the  tremendous</span><span>  crowd  that  was  to  be  seen</span></p> <p><span>  on  tile  grounds  yesterday.  Indeed</span><span>  it  is  getting-  eo  that  whilst  the</span><span>  concluding  Saturday  is  the  big</span><span>  day  for  country  visitors,  most</span><span>  townspeople  select  Thursday  as</span><span>  their  day  at  the  show  ""on  account</span><span>  of  the  children.""  Thus  is  the</span></p> <p><span>  aggregate  attendance'  ""staggered*</span><span>  BO  that  the  society  is  no  loser</span><span>  and  there  is  less  risk  of  anyone</span><span>  stopping  away  because  of  over-</span><span>  crowding.</span></p> <p><span>  The  show  is  capable  of  engen-</span><span>  dering  useful  thought  on  the  part</span><span>  of  elder  people.  It  should  not  call</span><span>  for  any  flight  of  imagination  on</span><span>  the  part  of  the  Rockhampton  citi-  {</span></p> <p><span>  zen  to  bring  home  a  realisation  j</span><span>  that  upon  those  sleek  cattle  in  the</span><span>  beef  and  dairy  sections  his  own</span><span>  prosperity  is  dependent.  How  many</span><span>  of  those  employed  at  the  meat-</span><span>  works,  the  district's  largest  gingie</span></p> <p><span>  avenue  of  employment,  bother  to  '</span><span>  visit  the  cattle  pens?  Or,  if  they</span><span>  do,  reflect  that  it  is  because  of</span><span>  the  weather-beaten  men  to  be</span><span>  found  there,  who  labour  in  the</span><span>  improvement  of  their  properties,</span><span>  who  lay  out  their  capital  in  the</span><span>  betterment  of  their  breeds,  and</span><span>  who  never  strike-over  lockers  or</span><span>  more  vital  things-that  their  own</span><span>  highly  paid  employment'  is  there</span><span>  to  run  smoothly  if  they  wish.</span></p> <p><span>  Furthermore,  it  is  possible  in</span><span>  this  good  season  to  see  at  the</span><span>  show  the  results  when  nature  is</span></p> <p><span>  kind  and  when  man  must  rely  on</span><span>  his  own  efforts  to  produce  the</span><span>  fruits  of  the  earth.  And  viewing</span><span>  and  comparing  these  results  it</span></p> <p><span>  becomes  more  manifest  that  the</span><span>  future  of  Central  Queensland's</span><span>  husbandry  must  largely  reside  on</span><span>  the  application  to  the  Boil  of  our</span></p> <p><span>  water  resources.</span></p> <p><span>  The  show  no  doubt  has  short-</span><span>  comings;  one  would  have  liked  to</span><span>  see  more  evidence  of  an  advance</span></p> <p><span>  in  secondary  industry  These  things</span><span>  may  come  later,  and  it  must</span><span>  be  remembered  that  the  war  which</span></p> <p><span>  disrupted  .so  many  things,  includ-</span><span>  ing  agricultural  ehows,  is  not  quite</span></p> <p><span>  two  years  ended.  It  takes  time  to</span><span>  recover  lost  ground  and  to  re-</span><span>  sume  the  momentum  that  leads  to</span><span>  expansion.  The  present  show  in-</span><span>  dicates  that  Rockhampton  is  get-</span><span>  ting  back  to  normal  and  it  should</span><span>  call  for  a  strong  excuse  for  any-</span><span>  one  to  admit  they  have  not  been</span><span>  there  on  at  least  one  day  this  week.</span></p> ",Article,1947-06-20,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON FRIDAY, JUNE 20, 1947.

Thej</span><span>  returns  relate  to  the  vital  matt</span><span>  of  population,  and  it  comes  almo:</span><span>  as  a  shock  to  learn  that  since  tl</span></p> <p><span>  last  census  was  taken  14  years  a&lt;</span><span>  Australia's  population  had  ßhow</span><span>  the  slowest  growth  on  record,  wii</span><span>  one  exception.

Tl</span><span>  increase  during  this  period  wt</span><span>  only  14.34  per  cent  compared  wit</span><span>  an  increase  of  21.97  per  cent  du</span><span>  ing  the  shorter  period  between  tl</span><span>  censuses  of  1921  and  1933.  Tl</span><span>  increase  in  the  1947  census  wf</span><span>  the  loweBt  of  any  excepting  tha</span><span>  in  1911.  The  growth  of  popuh</span><span>  tion  since  1933  has  been  due  ai</span><span>  most  entirely  to  the  excees  c</span><span>  births  over'  deaths.  The  naturi</span><span>  ¿¡.crease  was  889,677  compare</span><span>  with  a  gain  of  61,314  from  nc</span><span>  migration.  The  migration  figure</span><span>  were,  of  course,  affected  by  si</span><span>  years  of  war,  and  one  of  th</span><span>  brighter  features  of  the  report  i</span><span>  the  improvement  in  this  spliei</span><span>  noted  since  the  end  of  hostiÛtie:</span><span>  With  the  resumption  of  migratio</span><span>  since  the  war  the  annual  rat</span><span>  of  population  increase  from  thi</span><span>  source  has  risen  to  1.88  compare</span><span>  with  an  average  of  1.52  befor</span><span>  the  war.  This  trend  is  in  th</span><span>  right  direction,  and  it  should  be</span><span>  come  more  pronounced  as  trans</span><span>  port  to  bring  in  new  immigrant</span></p> <p><span>  becomes  available.</span></p> <p><span>  The  census  permits  of  a  free!</span><span>  examination  of  the  present  stat</span><span>  of  what  is  called  ""the  drift  t</span><span>  the  cities.""  Apparently  it  stil</span><span>  goes  on.  Since  1933  the  growth  o</span><span>  population  in  the  metropolita)</span><span>  areas  has  been  much  greater  thai</span><span>  that  of  the  total  population,  th</span><span>  respective  increases  being  23.7</span><span>  for  the  metropolitan  areas  com</span><span>  pared  with  14.3  in  the  total  pop</span><span>  ulation.  That  i»  not  altogethe</span><span>  desirable  but  the  urban  increas</span><span>  has  not  been  entirely  gained  at  thi</span><span>  expense  of  the  country,  since  pro</span><span>  vincial  population  increased  ty</span></p> <p><span>  17.97  in  the  1947  period  as  agains""</span></p> <p><span>  16.96  per  cent  in  1933.  Anothe</span><span>  noticeable  trend  that  can  hardi]</span><span>  be  considered  as  being  all  for  th</span><span>  best  is  the  ,  preponderance  o</span><span>  females  in  the  population  increase</span><span>  For  the  period  their  numbers  ex</span><span>  ceeded  that  of  males  by  86,897</span><span>  thus  bringing  the  number  of  male:</span><span>  and  females  in  Australia  mud</span><span>  closer  together.  The  abnormal  in</span><span>  crease  in  male  deaths  due  to  ser</span><span>  vice  casualties  was  a  big  facto]</span><span>  in  this  aspect  of  the  census.</span></p> <p><span>  Whilst  there  is  no  cause  for  grati-</span><span>  fication  at  the  general  return</span><span>  Queensland  can  derive  a  good  deal</span></p> <p><span>  of  eatisf~""tion  from  the  advance-</span><span>  ment  recorded.  The  populatioi</span><span>  of  this  State  bas  grown  from</span><span>  947,534  in  1933,  to  1,106,269  ii</span><span>  1947,  represented  by  567,539  malt</span><span>  and  538,730  females.  Queensland</span><span>  alao  shows  the  largest  increase</span><span>  from  immigration  and  there  has</span><span>  been  a  general  rise  in  the  propor-</span><span>  tion  of  the  population  in  rural</span><span>  areas  throughout  the  State.  Bris-</span><span>  bane  has  made  the  greatest  gain</span><span>  of  any  capital  city.</span></p> <p><span>  The  main  lesson  to  be  derived</span><span>  from  the  census  is  the  urgency  of</span><span>  Australia  gaining  more  population.</span><span>  Seven-and-a-half  million  people</span><span>  are  totally  inadequate  either  to</span><span>  hold  or  develop  this  continent.</span><span>  AVhilst  it  is  perfectly  true  that</span><span>  the  native  born  baby  is  the  best</span><span>  immigrant  the  requisite  numbers</span><span>  will  not  be  achieved  by  natural</span><span>  increase.  The  governments  are</span><span>  fully  seized  with  the  necessity  of</span><span>  bringing  in  immigrants,  but  there</span><span>  it  is  not  so  certain  that  the  tra-</span><span>  ditional  opposition  of  the  unions</span><span>  has  undergone  a  radical  change,</span><span>  though  open  antagonism  has  died</span><span>  down.  Moreover,  we  are  badly</span><span>  situated  for  the  reception  of  mi-</span><span>  grants  in  the  matter  of  housing.""</span></p> <p><span>  Even  if  everything  were  fav-</span><span>  ourable  for  their  reception  it  ii</span><span>  questionable  whether  the  migranta</span><span>  of  the  type  desired  by  Australia</span><span>  will  be  available.  We  are  inclined</span><span>  to  be  trifle  choosy  over  the  people</span><span>  we  will  admit.  Only  the  cream</span><span>  of  the  British  population  and  ex</span><span>  American  servicemen  with  plenty</span><span>  of  money  to  spend  here  can  really</span><span>  count  oh  a  welcome.  But  Britain</span><span>  wants  the  cream  of  her  population</span><span>  to  help,  her  out  of  her  own  eco-</span><span>  nomic  difficulties,  and  there  are</span><span>  indications  that  American  GX's</span><span>  will  find  conditions  better  in  their</span><span>  own  land  than  on  the  ""new  fron-</span><span>  tier.""  As  a  consequence  we  shall</span><span>  have  to  be  content  with,  and  may</span><span>  Oe  indeed  be  glad  to  get,  a  suffi-</span><span>  cient  number  of  displaced  persons</span><span>  in  Europe,  which  appears  to  be</span><span>  the  only  reservoir  to  draw  upon</span><span>  by  those  countries  in  need  of  more</span><span>  population.</span></p> <p><span>  The  census  returns  bring  home</span><span>  more  than  anything  else  could  do</span><span>  the  really  serious  problems  which</span><span>  confront  Australia,  and  Which</span><span>  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  na-</span><span>  tionalisation  and  social  questions</span><span>  I  that  are  rending  the  country  at</span></p> <p><span>  the  present  moment.</span></p> ",Article,1947-10-27,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1947.

Viewed</span><span>  I  from  the  outside  the  wind</span></p> <p><span>  I  spiralled  from  left  to  right  like</span></p> <p><span>  nie  hands  of  a  watch  or  racing</span><span>  j  horses  at  Callaghan  Park  and</span><span>  motor  hikes  at  the  show  grounds.</span><span>  Then  are  exceptions  to  this</span><span>  sporting  rule  of  course,  bnt  none</span><span>  in  the  case  of  the  cyclone.  No</span><span>  man  ever  saw  a  cyclone  in  the</span><span>  southern  hemisphere,  be  it  on  sea</span><span>  or  land,  which  did  not  spiral  from</span><span>  left  to  right-or  clockwise-just</span><span>  ag  nobody  in  the  northern  hemi-</span><span>  sphere  ever  saw  one  that  did  not</span><span>  spiral  in  the  opposite  direction,</span><span>  from  right  to  lett.</span></p> <p><span>  When  our  friend  of  last  week</span><span>  started  on  its  travels  it  was  any-</span><span>  body's  cyclone-anybody,  that  is</span><span>  to  say,  in  sunbaked  Queensland.</span></p> <p><span>  terns  its  normal  course,  due  to</span><span>  the  earth's  notation  and  move*</span><span>  ment,  would  be  '  south-west  to</span><span>  cross  the  Queensland  coast  be-</span></p> <p><span>  tween  Cairns  and  Mackay,  after</span><span>  which  it  recurves  to  south  and</span><span>  then  south-east,  moving  off  to</span><span>  end  its  days  as  it  began  them:  on</span><span>  the  bosom  of  Father  Ocean.  In</span><span>  this  case,  however,  a  southern</span><span>  ""high""  had  its  centre  south-east</span><span>  ¡from  Sydney,  and  was  pushing  np</span><span>  fresh  to  strong  south-east  winch)</span><span>  along  the  Queensland  coast,  and</span><span>  thia  ""cushioned""  off  the  cyclone</span><span>  so  that  its  course  was  about</span><span>  south,  and  it  seemed  for  a  time</span><span>  as  if  it  would  spend  the  whole  of</span><span>  its  life-and  waste  its  .precious</span><span>  ufe-giving  water-over  the  ocean.</span><span>  The  best  explanation  of  this</span><span>  ""cushioning  off""  is  to  take  for</span><span>  example  a  swarm  of  bees.  The</span><span>  rate  of  flight  of  each  individual</span><span>  insect  is  very  high,  but  the</span><span>  movement  of  the  whole  swarm  is</span></p> <p><span>  erratic  and.  wmparatively,  slow.</span><span>  The  only  difference  is  that  while</span><span>  none  could  foretell  the  course  of</span><span>  *  -f?*1?1  of  bees»  a  k  Possible,</span><span>  with  knowledge  of  contending</span><span>  pressure  systems,  to  forecast  the</span><span>  track  of  a  cyclone.</span></p> <p><span>  Keeping  in  mind  the  dock-wise</span><span>  au-  movement  at  the  «round  or</span></p> <p><span>  ocean  surface  it  is  easy  to  see</span><span>  that,  giving  the  whole  cyclone</span><span>  system  a  southerly  movement,  the</span><span>  wind  in  the  forward  right-hand</span><span>  quadrant  of  the  system  will  he</span><span>  south-east.  This  is  the  only,  oc-</span><span>  casion  in  Queensland  when  a</span><span>  south-east  wind  is  experienced  on</span><span>  a  low  or  falling  barometer,  the</span><span>  cyclone  being  of  course  a  low</span><span>  pressure  system,  while  the  ordin-</span><span>  ary  south-east  wind  is  the  child</span><span>  of  the  boisterous  high  pressure</span><span>  systems  which  surge  up  from  the</span><span>  great  Southern  Ocean.  That  is</span><span>  how  it  came  that  on  Wednesday</span><span>  last  Rockhampton  opened  the  day</span><span>  with  a  strong  south-east  wind  and</span><span>  a  high  barometer  and  finished,  it</span><span>  with  a  strong,  gusty  south-east</span><span>  wind  and  a  falling  barometer.  Il</span><span>  was  a  perfect  example  of  conflict</span><span>  between  two  diametrically  oppo-</span><span>  site  wind  systems,  one  of  the  main</span><span>  characteristics  of  which-the</span><span>  south-east  wind-was  the  same  in</span><span>  both  in  the  conditions  as  the}</span><span>  affected  this  city.</span></p> <p><span>  By  notr  it  had  become  a  ques-</span><span>  tion  of  the  relative  strength  o</span><span>  conflicting  forces,  and  while  tb</span><span>  cyclone  was  shouldered  off  an</span><span>  made  a  southerly  instead  of  i</span><span>  south-west  course,  we  know  tha</span><span>  it  prevailed  and  crossed  the  coas</span><span>  just  north  of  Brisbane.  While  th</span><span>  benefits  it  brought  would  hav</span><span>  been  welcomed  in  every  part  o</span><span>  the  State,  it  has  to  be  concede</span><span>  that  it  could  not  well  have  falle</span><span>  more  propitiously.

Within  a  month</span><span>  it  is  predicted  that  there  will  be</span><span>  plenty  of  petrol  ticket«  but  no</span><span>  petrol.</span></p> <p><span>  A  certain  amount  of  sympathy</span><span>  can  be  felt  for  private  motoriste</span><span>  who  are  singled  ont  for  special</span><span>  taxation  but  are  allowed  little</span><span>  pleasure  or  satisfaction  from  being</span><span>  a  car-owner.  Seeing  that  the  coun-</span><span>  try  is  no  longer  /at  war  and  there</span><span>  is  no  need  to  build  up  reserves  for</span><span>  that  purpose,  it  should  not  be  too</span><span>  rquch  to  expect  that  the  manipula-</span><span>  tion  of  Australia's  petrol  stocks</span><span>  might  have  been  well  enough  man-</span><span>  aged  for  the  car  owner  desiring  to</span><span>  make  use  of  his  vehicle  during  the</span><span>  holiday  season,  to  be  allowed  a</span><span>  little  more  generous  treatment.  Of</span><span>  course,  if  he  himself  has  prevented</span><span>  that  by  the  purchases  in  September</span><span>  and  October  which  have  inspired</span><span>  the  present  official  action,  then  he</span><span>  has  helped  fashion  a  rod  for  his</span></p> <p><span>  own  shoulders.  '  Some  hint  -of  the  ;</span><span>  extent  of  these  purchases  was  ]</span></p> <p><span>  conveyed  in  the  Federal  -Parliament</span><span>  recently,  whop  it  was  stated  that</span><span>  so  much  petrol  was  stored  in  pri-</span><span>  vate  garages  and  onthouses  that</span></p> <p><span>  it  constituted  a  menace  to  towns  j</span></p> <p><span>  and  cities  in.case  of  fire.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is,  perhaps,  not  beyond  the</span><span>  bounds  of  possibility  that  this  sud</span><span>  den  alarm  at  the  petrol  position</span><span>  on  the  eve  of  '  the  holiday  season</span><span>  has  behind  it  a  wish  tö  divert  to</span><span>  the  railways  and  languishing  gov-</span><span>  ernment  airlines  the  very  remun-</span><span>  erative  passenger  traffic  that  will</span><span>  be  on  the  move  for  the  next  month</span><span>  or  six  weeks.

Guest  of  Honour  session  by</span><span>  hearing  a  strange  voice-none  other</span><span>  than  that  of  their  wandering</span><span>  Attorney-General,  Dr  H.  V.  Evatt.</span></p> <p><span>  It  described  -  with  becoming</span><span>  modesty  -  how  Australia  stood  the</span></p> <p><span>  rest  of  the  nations  to  attention,</span><span>  and  then  told  them  where  they  both</span><span>  got  on  and  off.  Three  days  later-</span><span>  an  ecstatic  New  York  message  told</span><span>  us  of  ""the  World  Citizen  of  ths</span><span>  Month""  who,  finding  nothing  more</span><span>  on  this  planet  to  tidy  np,  was</span><span>  leaving  for  home.  That,  too,  was</span><span>  Dr  Evatt,  who,  said  the  fervid</span><span>  splurge,  left  New  York  unsung  by</span><span>  citizens  any  more  discriminating  of</span><span>  the.  status  of  ""world""  citizenship</span><span>  than  ""a  large  gathering  of  Aus-</span><span>  tralian  officials,""  including  our  own</span><span>  Messrs  Forde  and  Makin.</span></p> <p><span>  But'the  most  astonishing  aspect</span><span>  of  it  all  was  that  it  should  have</span><span>  been  deemed  necessary  to  en-</span><span>  lighten  Australian  citizens  regard-</span><span>  ing  what  was  being  contemplated</span><span>  or  done  abroad  in  their  name.  If</span><span>  anything  has  stood  out  more  clear-</span><span>  ly  than  the  intolerance  and  bluster</span><span>  of  Australia's  foreign  policy</span><span>  under  Labour,  it  was  that  the  Aus-</span><span>  tralian  people  were  the  last  to  be</span></p> <p><span>  consulted  on  informed  thereanent.</span></p> <p><span>  Then  there  came  the  wild  sug-</span><span>  gestion  that  Dr  Evatt  might  don</span><span>  silk  to  lead  .the  bank  case  for  thc</span><span>  Government  in  the  High  Court:  but</span><span>  that  was  merejdte  flying.  Quite</span><span>  apart  from  its  impropriety,  even</span><span>  the  Chifley  Government  is  likely</span><span>  to  shy  off  its  Attorney-General</span><span>  leading  its  defence  before  a  Bench</span><span>  that  has  been  the  long-suffering</span><span>  target  i  of  Labour  play-boys.  Ap-</span><span>  pearances  are,  however,  that  the</span><span>  kite-flying  has  been  to  sustain  the</span><span>  drooping  Chifley  Government  pres-</span><span>  tige  abroad,  and  to  infuse  fresh</span><span>  courage  in  the  bewildered  Labour</span><span>  lads  at  Canberra.  Both  are  badly</span><span>  needed,  and  if  Dr  Evatt  cóuld  help</span><span>  to  that  end  and  at  the  same  time</span><span>  placate  his  own  well-developed</span><span>  vanity,  his  aid  is  assured.</span></p> <p><span>  That  Dr  Evatt  needs  any  such""</span><span>  bolstering  on  his  own  account  is</span><span>  unlikely,  for-even,  though  he  is</span><span>  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  and  will</span><span>  probably  occupy  the  throne  while  Mr</span><span>  Chifley  is  warming  his  feet  at  New</span><span>  Zealand's  hot  springs,  the  returning</span><span>  wanderer  is  reputedly  scanning</span><span>  more-distant  and  brighter-horizons</span><span>  than  those  offered  by  a  discredited</span><span>  Australian  Labour  Party.  What-</span></p> <p><span>  soever  else  his  attributes  Dr  Evatt</span><span>  is  no  leader  of  lost  causes.  Labour</span><span>  bas  already  lost  two  referendums</span><span>  sponsored  by  him  and  is  faced  with</span><span>  the  fight  of  its  life  over  a  Banking</span><span>  Act  or  60  clauses  that  the  -Canberra</span><span>  Brains  Trust  is  reputed  to  hav*</span><span>  built  up,  from  the  Bill  &lt;>f  six  clausas</span><span>  which  he  left.  He  is,  therefore,  in</span><span>  a  position  now  to  say  that  his  six</span></p> <p><span>  ¿janse  Bill  was  watertight  and  fool-</span><span>  proof.  Nor  is  he  likely  to  sponsor</span><span>  the  referendum  on  price-fixing  that</span><span>  is  to  be  held  early  next  year,  there</span></p> <p><span>  being  te^4t^j^»f^  than  Dr</span></p> <p><span>  Evatt  td  Bee,  from  the  temper  of</span><span>  the  people  as  revealed  in  Victoria,</span><span>  that  there  is  an  odds-on  chance  of</span><span>  being  lost.</span></p> <p><span>  -  Finally  there  is  not  much  in</span><span>  hoing'  deputy  to  a  Prime  Minister</span><span>  whose  Government  stands  a  first</span><span>  class  chance  of  being  mangled  at</span><span>  Joegrt  election,  and  Dr  Evatt  aspires</span><span>  to  no  cross  of  martyrdom  on  the</span><span>  Opposition  Benches.  Hence  it  is</span><span>  that  if  .Dr  Evatt  is  being  recalled</span><span>  to  Australia  to  fill  the  role  of</span><span>  scapegoat,  some  of  Canberra's</span><span>  brightest  intellect«  are  liable  to  get</span><span>  a  shock.  What  they  are  unable  to</span><span>  realise  is  'that  a  Government  which</span><span>  is  discrediting  itself,  at  the  rats</span><span>  that  the  Chifley  Government  seems</span><span>  intent  upon  doing,  offers,  little  to</span><span>  a  man  of  Evatt's  qualifications,</span><span>  howsoever  strenuously  the  party</span><span>  boneheads  may  scramble  for  th**</span></p> <p><span>  sweets  of  office.</span></p> <p><span>  A  straw  in  the  wind  was  Evatt'i</span><span>  recent'righteous  disclaimer  that  all</span><span>  to  come  out  of  Moscow  is  not  evil,</span><span>  which  might  be  remembered  grate-</span><span>  fully  by  Russia  'when  the  vote  is</span><span>  being  cast  next  year  to  replace</span><span>  Trygye  Lye  a*  Secretary-General</span><span>  of  the  United  Nations'  organisation.</span><span>  Notwithstanding  Australia  main-</span><span>  taining  costly  legations  and  con-</span><span>  sulates  in  countries  which,  do  not</span><span>  exchange  with  her  a  barrow-load</span><span>  of  trade  his  championship  of  thc</span><span>  small  nations  did  not  deter  their</span></p> <p><span>  voting  him  out  of  the  presidency</span><span>  of  the  United  Nations'  Assembly</span><span>  this  year/so  that  a  ""smile  ifrom</span><span>  Moscow  at  -the  right  time  may</span><span>  prosper  his  fondest  hopes.

Opinions</span></p> <p><span>  vary  as  to  whether  the  shoes  will</span></p> <p><span>  become  vacant  through  their  pre-</span><span>  sent  wearer  going  upstairs  to  thc</span><span>  job  of  Governor  of  the  Common-</span><span>  wealth  Bank,  or.because  he  ""pulled</span><span>  I  on""  a  ""strong-man""  fight  with  the</span><span>  banks  which  electors  have  taken</span><span>  out  of  his  hands  and  are  ready  and</span><span>  horribly  willing  to  chase  Labour</span><span>  into  the  Opposition  wilderness.</span><span>  Labour  does  not  want  single-handed</span><span>  Strong  men  nor  does  it  want  clever</span><span>  men.  It  wants  ""yes-men""  who  do</span><span>  not  get  too  far  ahead  of  the  team,</span><span>  and  men  with  no  intellect  above</span><span>  Caucus  level.  It  reckons  that  Chif-</span><span>  ley  ventured  too  far  on  a  diminish-</span><span>  ing  Labour  status,  and  also  that</span><span>  Evatt  knows  more  than  is  good</span><span>  for  Caucus.  ""To  date,  the  most</span><span>  ardent  bidder  is  Speaker  Rosevear,</span><span>  who  on  several  occasions  has  des-</span><span>  cended  from  the  Chair  to  tell  the</span><span>  banks  from  the  floor  Of  the  House</span><span>  what  he  thought  of  them-not</span><span>  that  jt  mattered^  what  the  banks</span><span>  thought  of  his  views,  but  it  was</span><span>  important  to  get  them  before  rank</span><span>  and  filers  with  an  influence  in</span><span>  Caucus.  That  can  be  explained,</span><span>  out  not  necessarily  excused,  In  a</span><span>  House  where  the  Government  has</span><span>  a  microscopic  majority.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  background  the  three</span><span>  ""Tory""  State  Governments  are</span><span>  preparing  to  assail  the  Chifley  Gov-</span><span>  ernment  on  finance,  with  special</span><span>  regard  'to  the  Federal  Govern-</span><span>  ment's  flair  for  doing  the  lion's</span><span>  share'  of  taxing  and  holding  the</span><span>  purse  strings.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  MAY  24,  1947.</span></p> <p><span>  THIS  EMPIRE</span></p> <p><span>  Homing  Royalty  received  the</span><span>  other  day  no  less  tumultuous  a</span><span>  welcome  in  London  where  in  1048</span><span>  the  English  people  beheaded  a</span><span>  king,  than  they  had  received  a  few</span><span>  days  earlier  at  Portsmouth  where</span><span>  in  1757  they  shot  an  admiral.  They</span><span>  lopped'off  the  head  of  Charles  I</span><span>  as  a  sequel  to  his  losing  a  fight</span><span>  with  the  Parliament  of  the  people,</span><span>  and  Admiral  Byng  provided  first</span><span>  blood  to  the  law  that  provided  the</span><span>  same  punishment  to  all  ranks  for</span><span>  shirking  battle  with  the  enemy.</span><span>  No  king  has  been  beheaded  since</span><span>  Charles  for  flouting  the  wishes  of</span><span>  the  people,  but  they  sent  one  pack-</span><span>  ing  in  1936  on  that  very  account.</span></p> <p><span>  These  reflections  are  induced  by</span><span>  the  fact  that  today  is  Empire  Day.</span><span>  Conceived  just  50  years  ago  by  a</span><span>  Canadian  woman  in  Ontaria,  and</span><span>  promulgated  with  immense  labour</span><span>  by  an  ardent  Irishman  (Lord</span><span>  Meath)  Empire  Day  is  intended  to</span><span>  commemorate  or  emphasise  an  em-</span><span>  pire  held  together  by  invisible</span><span>  threads  which  baffle  the  foreigner</span><span>  in  time  of  peace  and  stagger  him</span><span>  in  time  of  war.  Not  only  did</span></p> <p><span>  Iiord  Meath  discover  that  the  black-</span><span>  est  ignorance  regarding  the  British</span><span>  Empire  prevailed  at  the  heart  of</span><span>  that  Empire,  but  Lord  Elton  has</span><span>  shown  that  malevolent  foreign  and</span><span>  ignorant  British  politicians  are</span></p> <p><span>  acclaimed  nowhere  more  consist-</span></p> <p><span>  ently  than  in  Britain  when  malign-</span><span>  ing  the  Empire's  greatest  achieve-</span></p> <p><span>  ments.</span></p> <p><span>  Time  was,  of  course,  when  even</span><span>  well-informed  British  folk  believed</span></p> <p><span>  that.  Great  Britain  possessed  the</span><span>  British  Empire.  Many  of  our</span><span>  American  servi  cernen  cousins  who</span><span>  came  to  our  succour  believed  that,</span><span>  and  quite  a  lot  of  Australian  peo-</span></p> <p><span>  ple  who  should  know  better  still  '</span><span>  believe  it.  That  came  about</span></p> <p><span>  through  Great  Britain  being  the  j</span><span>  head  of  an  Empire  of  subject  j</span><span>  States  all  on  the  road  to  self-gov-  '</span><span>  ernment,  but  in  different  stages  to-</span><span>  wards  that  desirable  end.  By  im-</span></p> <p><span>  perceptible  stages  '  the  leading;</span><span>  strings  disappeared  and  the  Domin-</span><span>  ions  of  Australia,  Canada,  'New.</span><span>  Zealand  and  South  Africa  became</span><span>  ""autonomous  communities  within</span></p> <p><span>  the  British  Empire,  equal  in</span><span>  status,  though  united  by  a  common</span><span>  allegiance  to  the  Crown.""  It  is</span><span>  time  now,  therefore,  to  take  fresh</span><span>  stock  of  the  Empire  of  50  years</span><span>  ago  when  Great  Britain  stood  at</span><span>  the  head  of  a  staggering  variety  of</span><span>  races,  colours  and  creeds,  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  only  League  of  Nations  which  has</span></p> <p><span>  ever  worked-a  world-wide  Com-  j</span></p> <p><span>  raonwealth  which  has  banished  war</span></p> <p><span>  from  within  its  borders,  within  j</span><span>  which  dwells  one-third  of  the</span><span>  human  race.  It  is  more  correct</span><span>  now  to  say  that  Great  Britain  is</span><span>  one  member  only  of  a  great  associa-</span><span>  tion  of  free  nations  and  dependen-</span><span>  cies,  with  special  responsibilities  to</span><span>  the  latter  and  equality  with  the</span></p> <p><span>  fenner.</span></p> <p><span>  During  the  century,  when  an  un-</span><span>  challengeable  British  ííavy  gave  it</span><span>  world  predominance,  the  British</span><span>  Empire  gave  the  people  of  the</span><span>  world  the  only  century  without  a</span><span>  war  since  the  age  of  the  Antonine</span><span>  Emperors  of  Rome.  The  whole</span><span>  string  of  would-be  world  dictators,</span><span>  from  Alexander  to  Hitler,  would</span><span>  have  swamped  the  world  in  blood</span><span>  to  obtain  a  world  dominance  that</span><span>  the  .British  Empire  had  for  100</span><span>  years,  and  used  only  to  build  up</span></p> <p><span>  enramunities  of  free  men.</span></p> <p><span>  There  can  be  little  doubt  that</span><span>  the  secret  of  the  Empire's  vitality</span><span>  is  the  very  looseness  of  the  ties</span><span>  which  hold  it  together.  Had  it</span><span>  been  mandatory  to  teach  school</span><span>  children  the  rudiments  of  Empire</span><span>  history-as  other  nations  would</span><span>  have  done-or  if  it  had  been</span><span>  drummed  into  them  that  the  Brit-</span><span>  ish  Empire  is  the  most  fruitful</span><span>  political  'achievement  in  history,</span><span>  they  may  have  become  self-con-</span><span>  scious  and  that  elusive  quality</span><span>  that,  for  300  years,  has  kept  the</span><span>  Empire  alive  and  constantly  evolv-</span><span>  ing,  might  have  evaporated  into</span><span>  thin  air.  Yet  it  is  worth  recal-</span><span>  ling  that,  as  the  age  of  natior^;  is</span><span>  counted,  the  four  great  British  Do-</span><span>  minions  were  but  the  other  day</span><span>  primitive  colonies  strictly  adminis-</span><span>  tered  from  London;  yet  today  they</span><span>  are  great  modern  communities,  ]</span><span>  each  as  completely  self-governing</span><span>  as  is  Great  Britain.  That,  in  it-</span><span>  self,  is  one  of  the  greatest  politi-</span><span>  cal  achievements  in  history.</span></p> <p><span>  When  pessimism  as  to  the  future</span><span>  of  the  British  Empire  sits  en</span></p> <p><span>  j  throned,  it  is  well  to  remember</span><span>  !  with  what  glee  its  enemies  saw  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  falling  away  of  the  four  Do-</span></p> <p><span>  minions  the  dismemberment  of  the</span><span>  parent  body.

In  a  speech  at  Rich-</span><span>  mond,  Virginia,  on  March  19,  he</span></p> <p><span>  declared  that  there  was  no  indus-</span><span>  trial  dislocation  in  Australia;  that</span><span>  the  operation  of  the  Arbitration</span><span>  Court  substantially  contributed  to</span><span>  the  ""splendid  results""  of  Aus-</span><span>  tralia's  wartime  and  post-war  econ-</span><span>  omy.  In  no  part  of  the  -world,  he</span><span>  said,  was  the  trades  union  move-</span><span>  ment  so  completely  part  of  the</span><span>  national  structure  aa  in  Australia</span><span>  .  .  .  Australia's  industrial  position</span><span>  was  due  to  a  system  pf  arbitration</span></p> <p><span>  and  conciliation  which  was  more</span><span>  satisfactory  than  in  any  other  part</span><span>  of  the  world.  It  had  brought  added</span><span>  respect  for  the  law  and  smooth</span><span>  working  in  the  adjustment  of  wages</span><span>  and  conditions,  and  it  had  mini-</span><span>  mised  friction  by  way  of  strikes</span><span>  and  lock-outs.  Admitting  teat  there</span><span>  were  ""occasional  industrial  dislo-</span><span>  cations""  he  claimed  that  they  were</span><span>  the  aftermath  of  the  terrible  war</span><span>  years.  Arbitration,  he  concluded,</span><span>  had  brought  about  harmonious  re-</span><span>  lations  between  master  and  man  in</span><span>  Australia.</span></p> <p><span>  Whatever  effect  this  remarkable</span><span>  utterance  had  on  his  auditors  at</span><span>  Richmond-the  Virginians  are  by</span><span>  tradition  a  courteous  people-its</span><span>  effect  in  the  speaker's  own  country</span><span>  has  been  one  of  staggered  amaze-</span><span>  ment  at  what  must  be  interpreted</span><span>  ag  either  sheer  effrontery  or  ap-</span><span>  palling  ignorance.  Ou  the  very  day</span><span>  that  Mr  Makin  made  his  extraordin-</span><span>  ary  statements  upwards  of  100</span><span>  ships  were  idle  and  the  shipping</span><span>  trade  of  Sydney  held  up,  all  in</span><span>  defiance  of  the  Arbitration  Court</span><span>  and  the  Stevedoring  Commission;</span><span>  the  Amalgamated  Engineering</span><span>  Union  had  launched  a  strike  that</span><span>  must  tie  up  the  transport  system</span><span>  of  a  State  and  inflict  hardship  and</span><span>  suffering  on  a.  large  community:</span><span>  whilst  the  Australian  Council  of</span><span>  Trades  Unions  had  issued  orders</span><span>  for  a  nation-wide  stoppage  of</span><span>  work  on  May  1  to  force  govern-</span><span>  ments  to  introduce  the  40-hour</span><span>  week  regardless  of  whether  or  not</span><span>  the  Arbitration  Court  found  it</span></p> <p><span>  practicable.  In  the  light  of  these</span><span>  more  recent  happenings,  of  scores</span><span>  of  like  nature,  the  most  charit-</span><span>  able  view  of  Mr  Makin's  Bpeech  is</span><span>  to  say  it  was  ludicrous.</span></p> <p><span>  But  ludicrous-or  audacious-as</span><span>  was  the  Ambassador's  speech,  made</span><span>  for  overseas  consumption,  it  was</span><span>  dwarfed  by  the  Prime  Minister's</span><span>  attempt  to  justify  it.  In  the  House</span><span>  of  Representatives  on  Friday  Mr</span><span>  Chifley  declared  that  he  supported</span><span>  Mr  Makin's  statement  ""that  the</span><span>  arbitration  laws  of  Australia  were</span></p> <p><span>  held  in  respect  by  both  employers</span><span>  and  employees.

That  a  majority  of  Aus-</span><span>  tralian  employers  and  employees  are</span><span>  prepared  to  obey  the  arbitration</span><span>  laws  is  true  undoubtedly.  But  they</span><span>  are  not  permitted  to  do  so-as</span><span>  both  Mr  Makin  and  Mr  Chifley  well</span><span>  know-because  of  the  licence  given</span><span>  to  disruptive  elements  which  are</span><span>  avowedly  out  to  destroy  the  arbi-</span><span>  tration  system,  root  and  branch.</span><span>  The  Sydney  waterside  strike,  the</span><span>  engineers'  strike,  and  the  May  Day</span><span>  ultimatum  are  fomented  by  this</span><span>  element  because  the  Government  of</span><span>  the  day  has  given  way  to  them</span><span>  time  after  time,  and  has  not  the</span><span>  courage  to  enforce  the  arbitration</span><span>  laws  or  any  other  law  which  they</span><span>  care  to  defy.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  light  of  their,  actions  to-</span><span>  wards  upholding  the  arbitration</span><span>  system  both  Mr  Makin  and  Mr</span><span>  Chifley  ought  to  hide  their  heads  in</span><span>  shame,  when  advancing  the  startl-</span><span>  ing  claims  contained  in  their</span><span>  speeches.  It  has  won  for  both  of</span><span>  them  nothing  but  cynical  laughter</span><span>  in  their  own  country,  and  is  not</span><span>  likely  to  win  any  added  respect</span><span>  from  outside,  where  people  know</span><span>  better,  notwithstanding  the  efforts</span><span>  of  our  Department  of  Information.</span></p> ",Article,1947-03-24,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON MONDAY, MARCH 24, 1947.

For  it</span><span>  seems  .to  be  accepted  that,  while</span><span>  she  may  not  marry  other  than  as</span><span>  approved  by  her  subjects,  neither</span><span>  will  she  marry  at  all  other  than</span><span>  as  she  wishes.  She  will  be  no</span><span>  party  to  smoothing  out  diplomatic</span><span>  tangles  by  a  marriage  bf.  con-</span><span>  venience.  It  ia  important  to  realise</span><span>  that  where  a  King  of  England</span><span>  marries  Ms  spouse  becomes  Queen</span><span>  of  England,  but  where  a  Queen  of</span><span>  England  marries  her  spouse  be-</span><span>  comes-  only  Prince  Consort  and</span><span>  occupies  no  official  position  of</span><span>  authority.  That,  of  course,  is  go</span><span>  that  the  line  of  succession  will</span><span>  remain  within  the  Royal  Family.</span></p> <p><span>  One  of  the  two  buildings</span><span>  associated  with  Elizabeth's  child-</span><span>  hood  to  be  razed  by  Nazi  bombs</span><span>  the  other  was  the  private  chapel</span></p> <p><span>  at  Windsor  in  which  she  was</span></p> <p><span>  christened-No.  145,  Picadilly  was</span></p> <p><span>  the  London  home  of  the  Duke  and</span><span>  Duchess  of.

During  much  of  that  time</span><span>  the  disciplining  hand  of  Queen</span><span>  Mary  played  an  important  part  in</span><span>  influencing  the  trend  of  life  of  the</span><span>  future  queen.

The  strikingly</span><span>  beautiful  Duchess  of  Kent,  one  of</span><span>  the  most  delightfully  dressed  of</span><span>  women,  has  developed  in  her  niece</span><span>  by  marriage  an  excellent  dress</span></p> <p><span>  sense.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  natural,  in  a  granddaughter</span><span>  of  King  Edward  VII,  that  Eliza-</span><span>  beth  should  have  not  only  a  deep</span><span>  love  for  animals,  but  that  this</span><span>  should  particularly  be  the  case  of</span><span>  dogs  and  horses;  she  is  a  fir-t-elass</span><span>  horsewoman.  À  product  of  t'ic  age,</span><span>  Elizabeth  is  not  of  the  d-onping</span><span>  type,  and  while  she  can-  .md  did</span><span>  durina  the  war-darn  her  own</span><span>  stockings  she  ig  also  an  accom-</span><span>  plished  car  driver.

The  argument  was  still</span><span>  raging  when  she  arrived  at  Buck-</span><span>  ingham  Palace,  per  service  truck,</span><span>  which  she  had  driven  through  the</span><span>  thickest  vehicular  traffic  in  all  of</span><span>  London'»  busy  thoroughfares.

The  grounds</span><span>  of  criticism  are  that  the  quality</span><span>  of  the  goods,  whether  foodstuffs,</span><span>  textiles  or  machines,  is  poor  and</span><span>  not  ""up  to  sample,  packing  is  not</span><span>  i  up  to  the  standard  of  the  market</span></p> <p><span>  !  and  deliveries  take  place  well  be-</span></p> <p><span>  hind  schedule.</span></p> <p><span>  Specifically,  it  is  complained  that</span><span>  tinned  fruit«  are  below  the  quality</span><span>  of  similar  lines  from  elsewhere,</span><span>  that  cloth  lengths  are  short  and</span><span>  contain  'many  flaws,  that  machine</span><span>  parts  are  of  inferior  workmanship,</span><span>  that  packs  fail  to  meet  local  stand-</span><span>  ards  and  are  ""  carelessly  shipped</span><span>  With  consequent  deterioration  and</span></p> <p><span>  loss  in  transit.  Worst  feature  of</span><span>  all  is  that  certain  firms  in  Sydney</span><span>  and  Melbourne  have  allegedly</span></p> <p><span>  failed  to  forward  orders  after  ac-</span></p> <p><span>  cepting  letters  of  credit  against</span><span>  the  goods.  Subsequent  attempts</span><span>  to  contact  them  failed,  for  they</span><span>  have  been  firms-  of  the  ""fly-by-,</span><span>  night""  type.  In  other  cases:</span><span>  where  the  orders  have  been  ful-i</span><span>  filled  complaint  is*  made  that,  in-</span><span>  stead  of  beuur  meticulous  when</span></p> <p><span>  manufacturing  goods,  it  appears</span><span>  Australia  ls  becoming  slipshod  and</span><span>  disposed  to  say  that  ""near  enough</span><span>  ie  good  enough.""  Perhaps  one</span><span>  ha«  not  to  go  to  Hong  Kong  to</span><span>  make  that  discovery.  During  the</span><span>  war,  on  the  plea  of  shortage  of</span><span>  essential  materials,  many  low</span><span>  grade  articles  were  permitted  to</span><span>  be  placed  on  the  market  and  the</span><span>  manufacturer  who  took  advantage</span><span>  of  that  licence  is  reluctant  to  mend</span><span>  bis  ways.  Of  course,  it  is  not  fair</span><span>  to  suggest  that  this  stigma  at-</span><span>  tachée  to  all  Australian  goods</span><span>  chipped  to  the  East.  Old  estab-</span><span>  lished  firms  that  had  pre-war  trad-</span><span>  ing  connexions  with  the  East  are</span><span>  «till  carrying  on  satisfactorily,  but</span><span>  the  reputation  of  all""  Australian</span><span>  goode  is  being  besmirched  by  an</span><span>  ail-too  large  post-war  type  of</span><span>  business  that  is  simply  inviting</span></p> <p><span>  commercial  suicide,  '</span></p> <p><span>  The  extent  of  the  logs  to  which</span><span>  Australia  is  thu«  exposed  is  of</span><span>  considerable  magnitude.  Host  of</span><span>  the  foodstuffs  of  Hong  Kong,  in-</span><span>  cluding  meat,  butter  and  flour,</span><span>  comes  from  Australian  supply  by</span><span>  international  allocation  and,  in</span><span>  addition,  Australia  exports  a  con-</span><span>  siderable  proportion  of  canned</span><span>  foodstuffs.  The  value  of  food-</span><span>  stuffs  and  provisions  rose  from</span><span>  4,500,000  dollars  in  1939  to  nearly</span><span>  12,000,000  dollars  last  year,  and</span><span>  the  1947  figures  are  expected  to</span></p> <p><span>  show  a  further  substantial  in-</span><span>  crease.  The  value  of  Australian</span><span>  piece  goods  and  textiles  have  gone</span><span>  up  from  2,500,00'doliars  in  1939  to</span><span>  11,000,000  dollars  this  year.  Surely</span><span>  thia  is  a  trade  worth  protecting  at</span></p> <p><span>  all  costs,  yet  this  ominous  com-j</span></p> <p><span>  ment  is  being  encountered  from</span><span>  the  executives  of  big  importing</span><span>  firms:  ""Things  are  sorting  them-j</span><span>  selves  out  now  and  goods  are  be-</span><span>  coming  available  elsewhere.

Shortage  of  materials  1</span><span>  been  the  principal  handicap,  a</span><span>  this  is  being  gradually  oyercoji</span><span>  particularly  in  the  case  of  housii</span><span>  where  much  of  the  lag  has  be</span><span>  made  up  and  the  lack  of  acco:</span><span>  modation  prevailing  since  the  w</span><span>  has  been  considerably  ameliorate</span></p> <p><span>  *  Substantial  progress  has  be</span><span>  made  with  the  new  Fitzroy  Brid</span><span>  notwithstanding  semi-flood  oom</span><span>  lions  early  in  the  year,  and  tei</span><span>  porary  shortages  in  essenti</span><span>  materials.

This</span></p> <p><span>  is  that  their  Government  treated</span></p> <p><span>  its  people  as  sensible  beings  who</span><span>  were,  willing  to  accept  restrictions</span><span>  if  given  a  convincing  reason;  that</span><span>  they  have  accepted  what  has  been</span><span>  imposed  on  them  because  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  essential  fairness  and  reasonable-</span></p> <p><span>  ness  of  Britain's  rationing  system.</span><span>  He  missed  the  conscious  feeling  of</span><span>  the  snugness  of  island  life;  what</span><span>  I  ever  be  the  trouble  or  the  rewards</span><span>  I  all  are  in  together,  with  no  invader</span></p> <p><span>  from  without  and  no  traitors</span><span>  within.</span></p> <p><span>  Peculiarly  enough,  these  be</span><span>  leagured  folk  saw  'rationing  far</span><span>  harder  to  accept  in  a  land  of</span><span>  plenty  such  as  USA.  In  the  case</span><span>  of  the  British  they  knew  that  the</span><span>  food  was  simply  not  in  the  coun-</span><span>  try,  where  USA  folk  could  see</span><span>  their  country  bursting  with  food,</span><span>  in  which  case  wrote  a  Glasgow</span><span>  woman  ""it  must  involve  far  more</span></p> <p><span>  conscious  virtue  to  cut  down  your</span><span>  own  share.""  But  if  it  was  good</span><span>  that  the  British  saw  the  need  for</span><span>  rationing,  it  was  better  that  their</span><span>  rulers  saw  to  it  that  there  was</span><span>  always  enough  to  honour  the  food</span><span>  coupons,  and  also  to  allow  some</span><span>  flexibility  and  humanity  in  appor-</span><span>  tioning  the  share.  Soon  after  Dun-</span><span>  kirk  it  was  established  that  every</span><span>  expectant  mother  and  every  child</span><span>  under  five  was  assured  of  a  pint</span><span>  of  milk  per  day  at  half  the  cur-</span><span>  rent  price.  Then  there  was  extra</span><span>  cheese  for  agricultural  workers:</span><span>  orange  juice  and  cod-liver  oil  foi</span><span>  children,  and  priority  in  orangée</span><span>  for  all  under  18-  With  a  rare  gen-</span><span>  ius  for  reaching  all  essential</span></p> <p><span>  needs,  the  Government  of  Britain</span><span>  treated  its  people  as  individuals</span><span>  with  special  tastes  and  needs,  and</span><span>  not  regimented  units  on  a  sheet  oí</span><span>  statistics.</span></p> <p><span>  This  result  was  achieved  less  bj</span><span>  the  submission  of  the  people  than</span><span>  through  the  helpfulness  of  the</span><span>  Ministry  of  Food  that,  instead  of</span><span>  trying  to  ""sell""  rationing  by  high</span><span>  pressure  salés  talk,  set  out  to  ex-</span><span>  plain  first  the  fundamental  neeù</span><span>  for  rationing  and  then  advising</span><span>  how  to  make  the  most  of  the</span><span>  short  commons.  It  kept  pace  with</span><span>  the  moving  events  in  the  grim</span><span>  drama,  and  when  flour  was  short</span><span>  in  1942  the  Ministry  gave  wide</span><span>  j  publicity  to  recipes  ijor  making</span><span>  1  potato  sconestand  pastry;  then</span><span>  j  when  potatoes  became  scarce  it</span></p> <p><span>  I  told  how  to  make  flour  dumplings</span><span>  I  to  fill  the  bill.  Strange  foods</span><span>  !  found  their  way  into  Britain  dur-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  those  times,  and  here  again</span><span>  the  Ministry  was  on  the  spot  to</span><span>  advise  people  as  to  their  use  and</span><span>  preparation.  Every  housewife</span><span>  throughout  the  length  and  breadth</span><span>  of  the  British  Isles  was  able  each</span><span>  week  to  look  over  the  Ministry's</span><span>  special  advertisement  and  feel  that</span><span>  she  was  a  partner  in  a  joint  enter-</span><span>  prise,  for  not  only  were  her  diffi-</span><span>  culties  being  understood,  but  she</span><span>  was  being  advised  on  how  best  to</span></p> <p><span>  surmount  them.</span></p> <p><span>  On  top  of  these  grim  reasons</span><span>  for  rationing,  the  war-time  food</span><span>  blockade  and  the  post-war  need  of</span><span>  more  food  for  Europe-the  latter</span><span>  superimposed  on  the  implacable</span><span>  need  to  export  manufactured  goods</span><span>  in  order  to  pay  for  imported  goods</span><span>  for  the  people  and  raw  materials</span><span>  for  the  industries-has  come  freak-</span><span>  ish  weather  that  first  froze  up  the</span><span>  whole  of  Britain's  moving  econ-</span></p> <p><span>  omy,  and  then  drowned  much  ot</span><span>  that  which  could  not  move.  Trans-</span></p> <p><span>  port  was  first  held  in  an  icy  grip</span><span>  BO  that  supplies  of  every  kind  of</span><span>  necessity  could  not  be  moved,  and</span><span>  then  growing  crops  were  sub</span></p> <p><span>  merged  and  mines  and  industries</span><span>  flooded,  so  that  when  the  waters</span><span>  subside  it  will  be  months  ere  there</span><span>  will  be  supplies  to  be  moved.</span></p> <p><span>  So  it  is  that  British  crowds</span></p> <p><span>  today  are  drab  aggregafcions  of</span><span>  unimpressive  people,  and  so  it  is</span><span>  that  for  the  hundredth  or  so  time</span><span>  in  her  long  existence  Britain  is</span><span>  down  and  out.  The  crowds  are</span><span>  drab  because  even  a  bishop,  whose</span><span>  episcopal  cope  was  disintegrating,</span><span>  was  able  to  have  it  relined  only</span><span>  when  ll  of  his  parishioners</span><span>  surrendered  a  coupon  each;  and</span><span>  Britain  is  down  and  out  because</span><span>  critics  say  she  is-just  as  they</span><span>  said  she  was  down  and  out  after</span><span>  Dunkirk.

In  th</span><span>  end  there  was  the  ludicrous  spa</span><span>  tacle  of  three  Governments  tryin</span><span>  to  remove  something  that  had  bee</span><span>  imposed,  and  was  being  main</span><span>  tained,  bjr  an  industrial  union.</span></p> <p><span>  There  may  have  been  anothe</span><span>  and  less  prominent  factor  that  ba'</span><span>  a  good  deal  with  the  removing  o</span><span>  the  embargo.  Within  the  pas</span><span>  week  or  two  a  large  amount  o</span><span>  goods  required  by  the  Dutch  hav</span><span>  been  transported  from  AustralL</span><span>  by  freighter  planes,  with  ever;</span><span>  indication  that  the  volume  wouh</span><span>  be  greatly  increased  as  machine!</span><span>  became  available.

Something  like  that  n</span><span>  occurring  in  respect  of  our  inter</span><span>  state  shipping  trade.  There  have</span></p> <p><span>  ¡been  so  many  waterfront  hold-up!</span><span>  j  that  merchants  are  prepared  t&lt;</span><span>  I  pay  the  extra  rail  and  air  freights</span></p> <p><span>  in  order  to  get  their  goods  regu-</span><span>  larly.  If  they  succeed  in  half</span><span>  killing  the  shipping  trade  thc</span><span>  waterfront  workers  will  not  bc</span><span>  the  first,  nor  perhaps  the  last</span><span>  who  have  cut  their  own  throats.</span></p> <p><span>  It  would  be  intensely  interesting</span><span>  Ito  see  a  balance  sheet  showing  thc</span><span>  debit  and  credit  of  the  .Dutch  ship-</span><span>  ping  ban.  On  the  debit  side  il</span><span>  has  been  shown  that  it  has  re-</span><span>  sulted  in  holding  up  Australian</span><span>  goods  purchased  for  the  N.E.L  to</span><span>  the  value  of  over  £5,000,000.  What</span><span>  lt  has  meant  in  loss  of  wages  to</span><span>  watersiders,  seamen  and  transport</span><span>  workers,  as  well  as  in  port  dues,</span><span>  fuelling  and  victualling  expenses,</span><span>  and  the  dozen  and  one  other</span><span>  avenues  of  commerce  associated</span></p> <p><span>  with  the  overseas  shipping  trade,</span><span>  is  beyond  computation,  but  it</span><span>  probably  ran  into  a  larger  aggre-</span><span>  gate  amount  than  the  £5,000,000</span><span>  worth  of  goods.</span></p> <p><span>  ?As  to  the  credit  side,  it  is  diffi-</span><span>  cult  to  see  where  tho  gains  come  in.</span><span>  That  it  helped  the  Indonesians  in</span><span>  the  slightest  degree  in  gaining  the</span><span>  measure  of  independence  they  have</span><span>  achieved  is  most  questionable.  If</span><span>  anyone  can  show  a  gain  it  is  the</span><span>  Communists,  who  instigated  the</span><span>  ban.  They  can  hardly  be  blamed</span><span>  if  they  feel  they  have  emerged</span><span>  with  a  sense  of  heightened  stature.</span><span>  It  cannot  be  escaped  that,  whilst</span><span>  three  Governments  were  striving</span><span>  for  the  lifting  of  the  embargo,  the</span><span>  final  say-so  rested  with  the  officials</span><span>  of  a  union.  That  leaves  the  door</span><span>  open  for  similar  occurrences  later</span></p> <p><span>  on.  .</span></p> <p><span>  Apart  from  these  considerations</span><span>  it  should  be  gratifying  to  Aus-</span><span>  tralia,  as  it  is  welcome  to  the</span><span>  Dutch  and  Indonesians,  to.  see  the</span><span>  ban  lifted.  Self-interest  alone</span><span>  advances  every  reason  why  this</span><span>  country  should  establish  and</span><span>  maintain  the  friendliest  relations,</span><span>  commercial  and  otherwise,  with  our</span><span>  nearest  and  biggest  neighbour  in</span><span>  I  the  near  west.

They</span><span>  found  that,  averaged  over  a  num-</span><span>  ber  of  years  to  1937,  the  people  of</span><span>  Britain  were  eating  about  35  per</span><span>  cent  less  meat  ,  than  did  their  an-</span><span>  cestors  in  the  days  of  the  austere</span><span>  George.  .  .</span></p> <p><span>  There  had  been  a  recovery  from</span><span>  the  slump  in  consumption  of</span><span>  about  the  middle  of  the  18th  cen-!</span><span>  tury  when,  due  no  doubt  to  the</span><span>  industrial  revolution  which  diverted</span></p> <p><span>  the  energies  of  Englishmen  from</span><span>  growing  meat  to  tending  machines,</span></p> <p><span>  it  was  less  than  half  of  that  of</span></p> <p><span>  125  years  earlier.  Consumption  of</span><span>  bread  changed  *  but  little  in  the</span><span>  two  centuries,  though'there  had</span><span>  been  an  increase  which  coincided</span><span>  with  the  drop  in  meat  consump-</span><span>  tion  in  the  186LVs.  Dieticians  may</span><span>  be  able  to  tell  us  how.  one  off-sets</span><span>  the  other.  The  consumption  oi</span><span>  potatoes  has  remained  practically</span><span>  even  over  .  the  two  centuries,</span><span>  whereas  cheese  consumption  in</span><span>  1837  was  a  mere  quarter  of  what</span><span>  it  was  and  beer  was  down  tb  little</span><span>  better  than  one-third.  On  the  other</span><span>  hand,  consumption'  of  both  milk</span><span>  and  tea  increased  considerably.  It</span><span>  seems,  on  the  surface  anyhow,  that</span><span>  consumption  of  most  home-grown</span><span>  products  vheld  its  own,  but  that</span><span>  refrigeration,  -  vastly  improved</span><span>  transport  and  distribution  not-,</span><span>  withstanding  imported  commodities</span><span>  have  not  made  up  the  shortage  of</span><span>  home'products  due  to  greater  in-</span><span>  dustrialisation  and  the  growth  of</span><span>  population.</span></p> <p><span>  It  scfemè  easy  to  speculate  thusly</span><span>  on  the  reasonB  for  so  radical  a</span></p> <p><span>  change  of  diet  in  Britain-until  we</span><span>  coiné  to  examine  what  has  .  hap</span><span>  .  pened  over  the  past  20  years  in</span><span>  our  own  land.  The  two  points  of</span><span>  ?comparison  are  closer  than  in  the</span><span>  case  bf  Britain,  CQmprising  as  they</span><span>  do  the.  five-year  average  to  1921</span><span>  and  the.  five-year  average  to  1941,</span><span>  this  being  à  clear  interval  of  20</span><span>  years.  The  result  bf  the  comparison</span><span>  -is  that,  of  14  staple  food  commodi-</span></p> <p><span>  ties  si?  showed  considerable  in-</span><span>  crease  ¿üi  the  consumption,  per  head</span><span>  of/population,  end  eight  showed</span><span>  almost  4»  great  decreases.</span></p> <p><span>  Odd  as  it  '  may  seem,  beer  con-</span><span>  sumption  was  down  by  2  per.  cent,</span><span>  and  «that'despite  the  -fact  that  the</span><span>  average  age  of  the  community  is</span><span>  much  higher-and  presumably</span><span>  thirstier-now  £ban  it  was  20  years</span><span>  ago.  But  ,±he""  consumption  of  make,</span><span>  ,  oats,  rice  and  wheat  was  down  by</span></p> <p><span>  38,  49;  17  and  Í0  per  cent  re-</span><span>  spectively,  or  by  ¡15  percent  in  the</span><span>  aggregate:  These  'aré  -''the  major</span><span>  food  grains,  source  of  carbohy-</span><span>  drates  or  the  element  lu  diet  which</span><span>  supplies  energy.  Wte  ate  12  per  cent</span><span>  itewer  potatoes,  9  .per  cent  fewer</span><span>  onions  and  drank  8  per  cent  lesa</span><span>  tea  and  coffee.  Only  that  fewer</span><span>  people  use  tobacco  than  imbibe</span><span>  these  drinks  it  might  be  said  that</span><span>  an  increase  ,of  26  per  cent  in  the</span><span>  consumption  of  tobacco  more  than</span><span>  offset,  this  diminished  intake  ol</span><span>  these  stimulante.  Anyway,  nature's</span><span>  adjustments  are  not  always  quite</span><span>  so  simple.  Nor  is  the  answer  to  bc</span><span>  found  in  the  40  per  cent  increase</span><span>  in  barley  consumption,  for  even</span><span>  with  this  increase  against  the  de-</span><span>  crease  in  consumption  of  the  othei</span><span>  four  grains,  barley  forms  less  that</span><span>  10  per  cent  of  the  total  grain  in-</span><span>  take.  Well  may  .  we  ask  if  '  thii</span><span>  generation  is  less  energetic  that</span><span>  -the  last,  -  only  that  the  relevani</span><span>  generation  is  just  arriving.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  other  side  of  the  scab</span><span>  and  additional  to  .  barley  and  to-</span><span>  bacco,  consumption  of  butter  anc</span><span>  'cheese  went  up  by  20  per  cent,  thai</span><span>  of  fresh  milk  by  21  per  cent,  thu</span><span>  of  all  meat  by  .  19  per  cent  and  tba</span><span>  of  sugar  by  6  per  cent.

The</span><span>  shameless  outpouring  of  colossal</span><span>  sums  of  money  for  negligible  re-</span><span>  turn,  the  impudent  boastings  of</span><span>  vast  achievements  when  whole</span><span>  Australian  armies  never  left  the</span><span>  mainland,  the  amMiug  cost  of</span><span>  ship6,  of  machine-gun  carriers,  of</span><span>  tanks  and  of  every  form  of  mili-</span><span>  tary  equipment  make  up  a  classical</span><span>  story  of  blunder  and  brag  ,  that  has</span><span>  yet  to  be  told.  It  i«  recalled  at</span><span>  .this  stage  to-  indicate,-  under</span><span>  Labour  administration,  how  very</span><span>  little  defence  is  to  be  got  for  even</span><span>  £50,000,000-per  annum.  On  the</span><span>  other  side,  of  the  picture  is</span><span>  the  fact  that  it  is  possible</span><span>  to  spend  many  times  .  that  sum</span><span>  per  annum  and  still  have  in-</span><span>  sufficient  manpower  to  use  the</span><span>  war  equipment.  If  everybody  stays</span><span>  behind  to  spend  the  £50,000,000</span><span>  and  there  is  nothing  to  prevent</span><span>  them  so  doing-spending  it  at  all</span><span>  for  howsoever  much  return  is  sheer</span></p> <p><span>  lunacy.  On  top  of  Australia's</span><span>  shockingly  poor  showing  in  the</span><span>  war-equipment  field,  is  the  fact</span><span>  that  she  was  the  only  combatant</span><span>  that  did  not  t»nseript-the  whole  bf</span></p> <p><span>  the  .  man  .  and  woman,  power  to</span><span>  serve  wherever  most  needed.</span></p> <p><span>  Not  eyen  the  grim  leesons  pf  the</span><span>  just-past  war  were  able  to  expand</span><span>  the  dwarfed  outlook  of  the  ALP  in</span><span>  regard  to  defence.  Nor  has  the</span><span>  changed  set-up  in  Asia,  with  not</span><span>  tens  but  thousands  of  millions  of</span><span>  Asiatics  all  surging  forward  to-</span><span>  wards  nationhood  shaken  the  ALP</span><span>  out  of  its  benighted  isolationism.</span><span>  The  whole  world  conscripted  into</span><span>  arms  leaves  the  ALP  still  bogged</span><span>  down  in  academic  discussion  on  the</span><span>  rights  of  man,  even  though  one  of</span><span>  the  most  starkly  taught  lessons  of</span><span>  the  last  30  years  is  that  the  only</span><span>  rights  worth  talking  about  are</span><span>  those  which  man  is  prepared  to</span><span>  defend.  The  theory  that''  voluntary</span><span>  defence  produced  the  cream  of  the</span><span>  nation's  fighters  ig  shattered  by</span><span>  the  invincible  conscript  armies  of</span><span>  Britain  and  America;  by  the</span><span>  dauntless,  resourceful-conscripts  of</span><span>  Germany;  and  by  the  indomitable</span><span>  fighters  of  the  Red  Army.  Hitler's</span><span>  conscripts  over-ran  practically  the</span><span>  whole  of  Europe;  Montgomery's</span><span>  conscript  armies'  chased  ,  the  dour</span><span>  fighting  Rommel  and  his  conscripts</span></p> <p><span>  out  of  North  Africa:  Eisenhower's</span><span>  conscripts  drove  the  Huns  out  of</span><span>  Baris;  while  Stalin's  conscripts</span><span>  held  the  cream  of  Hitler's  armies</span><span>  out  of  Leningrad  and  Stalingrad.</span><span>  The  heaviest  fighting  was  done  by</span><span>  conscripts  and  thrown  back  by</span><span>  other  conscripts.  German  con-</span><span>  scripts  scattered  the  defences  of</span><span>  Belgium  and  France  and  turned</span><span>  the  Maginot  .Line,  while  Allied</span><span>  conscripta,  shattered  Germany's</span><span>  Siegfried  Line  and  blasted  the  way</span><span>  to  Berlin.  It  appears  that  the  ALP</span><span>  has  not  pieced  up  these  recently</span><span>  written  pages  of  gory  history  but</span><span>  is  snoring  like  Rip  van  Winkle,</span><span>  back  in  the  days  when  no  gentle-</span></p> <p><span>  man  started  a  war  without  first</span><span>  giving  a  full  week's  notice.</span></p> <p><span>  No  special  pleading  or  specious</span><span>  argument,  no  '  passionate  ranting</span><span>  of  inherent  human  rights,  no  ethi-</span><span>  cal  brain-storms  on  the  solemn</span><span>  duties  of  men-including  hair-trig-</span><span>  ger  aggressors-can  upset  the  ver-</span><span>  dict  of  history  of  immediate,</span><span>  bloody  history;  but  it  is  unlikely</span><span>  that  the  grim  implications  of  these</span><span>  things  have  permeated  the  mental</span><span>  fastnesses  of  the  ALP.  If  Mr  Chif-</span></p> <p><span>  ley  knows  of  these  happenings  he</span><span>  knows  better  than  to  pit  his  know-</span><span>  ledge  against  the  mental  black-out</span><span>  of  the  .ALP.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  face  of  these  incontrovert-</span><span>  ible  facts  the  Chifley  statement,</span><span>  fresh..from  the  senile  groves  of  the</span><span>  Trades  Hall,  that  Australia's  de-</span><span>  fence  is  to  be  purely  voluntary,  is</span><span>  the  essence  of  hypocrisy,  the  most</span><span>  shameless  skulking  behind  the</span><span>  armour  of  our  allies.

"<p><span>  Olje  Womina  JMferin</span></p> <p><span>  HOCKHAMPTON</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  AUGUST  18,  1847.</span></p> <p><span>  CUMULATIVE  EFFECTS</span></p> <p><span>  Over  many  years  there  have  been</span><span>  warnings  as  to  the  injurious  effect,</span><span>  not  only  on  rural  industry  but  on</span><span>  tho  general  economy  of  the  Com-</span><span>  monwealth,  of  the  ""drift  to  the</span><span>  city,""  the  rising  costa  to,  producers</span><span>  brouht  about  by  each  fresh</span><span>  wage  increase  and  hours  curtail-</span><span>  ment  for  city  workers,  the  repres-</span><span>  sive  taxation  and  rural  labour  dif-</span><span>  ficulties.  Almost  daily  there  is  a</span><span>  complaint  or  warning  about  one  Or</span><span>  other  of  these  things;  but  very</span><span>  »rely  has  auf  one  gone  to  .  the</span><span>  length  of  pointing  out  what  should</span><span>  long  ago  have  been  obvions  to</span><span>  what  is  sometimes  called  ""the</span><span>  meanest  intelligence""  that  ail  of</span><span>  these  things  sooner  or  later</span><span>  most  have  a  cumulative  effect  of  a</span><span>  moat  disagreeable  character.  Now,</span><span>  with  th»  unexpectedness  of  a  bolt</span><span>  from  the  blas  comes  the  first</span><span>  authentic  indication  that  the  cumu-</span></p> <p><span>  lative  effects  of  the  ill-usage</span><span>  accorded  our  primary  industries</span></p> <p><span>  ara  about  to  be  felt.</span></p> <p><span>  Last  week,  without  any  warning</span><span>  that  such  .  step  was  contemplated,</span><span>  a  pronouncement  wa*  made  by  the</span><span>  Commonwealth  Minister  for  Com-</span><span>  merce  that  all  export  of  beef  and</span><span>  dairy  cattle  from  Australia  would</span><span>  forthwith  be  banned,  except  by</span><span>  permit.  He  explained  that,  whilst</span></p> <p><span>  thia  did  not  constitute  a  total</span><span>  embargo,  permite  to  export  would</span><span>  be  issued  only  in  extreme  cases</span><span>  and  after  a  thorough  ""investigation</span><span>  of  the  applications.  Ag  to  the</span><span>  reason  for  such  a  drastic  measure,</span><span>  Mr  Pollard  said  that  Australia  is</span><span>  faced  with  an  argent  need  to  build</span><span>  np  her  stocks  ox  dairy  and  beet</span><span>  cattle  aa  quickly  aa  possible.  The</span><span>  Government  had  a  duty  to  ensure</span><span>  that  there  was  a  plentiful  supply</span><span>  Of  stock  in  Australia  to  produce</span><span>  food  for  Britain  and  to  provide</span><span>  stock  for  soldier  settlers  now  tak-</span><span>  ing  np  land.  Until  this  was</span><span>  achieved  tho  export  of  cattle</span><span>  needed  in  Australia  could  not  be</span></p> <p><span>  permitted.  The  Minister,  confessed</span><span>  to  alarm  at  the  radncedireduction</span><span>  of  dairy  herds,  particularly  in</span><span>  Northern  New  Sooth  Wales.</span></p> <p><span>  He  could  easily  have  extended</span><span>  his  alarm  to  embrace  the  beef</span></p> <p><span>  herds  and  the  sheep  flocks.  Start-</span><span>  ling  as  it  is  in  its  general  effect,</span><span>  the  moat  striking  thing  about  the</span><span>  Ministerial  statement  ia  the</span><span>  acknowledgement  which  it  con-</span><span>  veys  that  there  has  taken  place  an</span><span>  alarming  drop  in  the  numbers  of</span><span>  Australian  beef  and  dairy  cattle</span><span>  {and  likewise  of  sheep)  upon  which</span><span>  the  economy  ahd  prosperity  of  the</span><span>  nation  is  largely  dependent.  It  is</span><span>  true  that  for  a  long  ""time  there</span><span>  has  been  no  lack  of  warning  that</span><span>  tins  very  thing  was  occurring,  but</span><span>  the  warnings  went  unheeded  by</span><span>  the  Government  and,  most  of  all,</span><span>  by  Australia's  urban  population.</span></p> <p><span>  Yet,  the  disclosure  should  cause</span><span>  no  surprise.  It  is  common  know-</span><span>  ledge  that,  for  many  years,  stock</span><span>  owners  have  been  compelled,  by</span><span>  ruinous  taxation,  to  withhold  mar-</span><span>  ketable  stock  until  the  next  finan-</span><span>  cial  year,  often  to  see  them  lose</span><span>  condition  ahd  value  through  ad-</span><span>  verse  seasons.  Bather  than  repeat</span><span>  the  experience  they  have  curtailed</span><span>  their  herds.  In  other  words,  the</span><span>  grazing  industry  has  been  dis-</span><span>  couraged  from  producing  to  its</span><span>  maximum  capacity.  Thia  has  been</span><span>  going  on  for  years,  but  no  attempt</span><span>  was  made  to  remedy  it.  Yet  some-</span><span>  one  in  authority  must  have  been</span><span>  assailed  by  a  fear  that  all  was</span><span>  not  well  with  the  stock  industry.</span><span>  Latterly  there  has  been  an  inten-</span><span>  sive  survey  by  departmental  offi-</span><span>  cers,  the  first  fruits  thereof  being</span><span>  this  embargo.  It  will  be  surprising</span><span>  if  there  is  not  more  to  follow,</span></p> <p><span>  .ince  no  sane  person  can  imagine</span><span>  that  the  retrogression  is  confined</span><span>  to  beef  and  dairy  cattle.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Minister  for  Commerce  says</span><span>  the  embargo  is  necessary  ""in  order</span><span>  to  provide  Australia  with  a  suffi,</span><span>  dent  number  of  stock  to  give</span><span>  Britain  an  adequate  supply  of</span><span>  food.""  He  could  have  gone  further</span><span>  and  emphasised  that  it  is  not  only</span><span>  Britain's  food  supply  that  is  at</span><span>  stake,  but  that  of  Australia's</span><span>  town  and  city  population  as  well.</span><span>  If,  for  reasons  of  his  own,  the</span><span>  Minister  has  refrained  from</span></p> <p><span>  pointing  to  the  logical  conclusion</span><span>  of  the  present  trend  of  rural  in-</span><span>  dustry,  there  are  others  who  have</span><span>  not  been  go  reticent.  Speaking  at</span><span>  the  Queensland  local  Authorities'</span><span>  [Conference  last  week,  a  delegate</span><span>  ¡from  Rosenthal  Shire  uttered  a</span><span>  pertinent  warning  as  to  what</span><span>  i  might  happen  in  the  future.  He</span></p> <p><span>  I  said,  that  people  were  leaving  the</span></p> <p><span>  i  land  because  of  uncongenial  condi-</span><span>  tions,  and  if  ihe  drift  were  not</span><span>  !  stopped  the  time  would  come,</span><span>  within  five  years,  when  there</span><span>  I  would  be  a  serious  shortage  of</span></p> <p><span>  butter,  milk  and  cheese.  If  such</span><span>  !  things  happened  the  conditions</span><span>  I  they  would  create  in  the  cities</span><span>  would  accomplish  more  in  three</span><span>  months  than  all  the  protests  and</span><span>  pleadings  of  the  man  on  the  land</span><span>  had  produced  in  scores  of  years.</span></p> <p><span>  Lest  this  be  regarded  as  a  lone</span><span>  voice  croaking  in  the  wilderness,</span><span>  the  same  sentiment  found  more</span></p> <p><span>  pungent  expression  about  the</span></p> <p><span>  same  time  from  the  President  of</span><span>  the  New  Sonth  -  Wale«  Farmers</span><span>  and  Settlers'  Association  in  his</span><span>  annual  address  to  the  organisation.</span><span>  He  said  that  if  ever  the  time  came</span><span>  when  Australia's  rural  population:</span><span>  demanded  the  right  to  share  in  the  |</span><span>  alleged  standard  of  living  enjoyed]</span><span>  by  the  urban  population,  thei</span><span>  nation  would  be  brought  to  dfsas-i</span></p> <p><span>  ^I</span></p> <p><span>  ter  and  the  population  of  the  cities</span><span>  would  starve.  Immediately  the  40-!</span><span>  hour  week  and  other  spurious</span><span>  social  advantages  were  applied  to</span><span>  the  primary  industries  that  would</span><span>  he  the  end  of  the  chapter-the</span><span>  whole  lot  of  us  would  starve.  The</span><span>  people  of  the  cities  would  be  moon-</span><span>  ing  round  the  place  like  dumb</span><span>  stupid  cattle  looking  for  something</span></p> <p><span>  to  eat.</span></p> <p><span>  A  pessimistic  flight  of  fancy,  it</span><span>  will  be  said.  Nothing  like  that</span><span>  could  ever  be  allowed  to  happen  in</span><span>  this  country.  Maybe  not.  But</span><span>  there  is  no  getting  round  that  fall-</span><span>  ing  off  in  sheep  and  cattle  numbers</span><span>  which  has  stung  someone  in  the</span><span>  national  Government  into  action.</span><span>  Yet,  these  things  will  not  be  cured</span><span>  by  embargoes  on  the  export  ol</span><span>  cattle  on  the  hoof  or  by  meat</span><span>  rationing  at  home.

On</span><span>  that  occasion  swimming  appears  to</span><span>  have  got  mixed  up  with  the  music,</span><span>  but  like  oil  and  water  at  a  subse-</span><span>  quent  date  it  was  found  that  the</span><span>  two  did  not  mix.  In  order  to  prove</span><span>  the  superiority  of  vocal  ^>ng  over</span><span>  instrumental  music,  tue  prince</span></p> <p><span>  offered  a  reward  to  such  bards  and</span><span>  minstrels  as  should  first  swim  the</span><span>  Conway.  There  were  several  com-</span><span>  petitors,  but  on  their  arrival  on</span><span>  the  opposite  shore  the  harpers</span><span>  found  themselves  unable  to  play</span><span>  owing  to  the  injury  their  harps</span><span>  had  sustained  from  the  water,</span><span>  whilst  the  bards  were  in  as  good</span><span>  a  tune  as  ever.  It  proved  the</span><span>  prince's  point,  though  his  manner</span><span>  of  doing  so  may  not  have  been</span><span>  quite  beyond  question.  Since  then</span><span>  the  swimming  carnival  and  the</span><span>  musical  festival  have  been  kept</span><span>  separate,  which  is  perhaps  as  well.</span><span>  It  is  doubtful  if  Rockhampton</span><span>  could  sustain  a  six-day  eisteddfod</span><span>  if  it  involved  a  number  of  swim-</span><span>  ming  events  on  the  Fitzroy  to  cor-</span><span>  respond  with  the  vocal  and  instru-</span><span>  mental  items.</span></p> <p><span>  ?During  the  56-year  reign  of</span><span>  Griffith  ap  Cynan  the  eisteddfod</span><span>  flourished  in  Wales.  Born  in  Ire-</span><span>  land  the  prince  brought  with  him</span><span>  from  that  country  many  Irish</span><span>  musicians  who  are  credited  with</span><span>  having  greatly  improved  the  music</span></p> <p><span>  of  Wales.  It  was  at  this  time  that</span><span>  there  was  framed  the  first  code  of</span><span>  laws  for  the  better  regulation  of</span><span>  the  contests  between  bards,  harp-</span><span>  ers  and  minstrels,  many  of  whom</span><span>  came  from  Scotland  and  England,</span><span>  On  the  annexation  of  Wales  to</span><span>  England  Edward  1  deemed  it  poli-</span><span>  tic  to  sanction  the  bardic  eistedd-</span><span>  fod  and  during  successive  reigns</span><span>  eisteddfodau  were  held  from</span><span>  time  to  time  by  Royal  commission.</span><span>  For  130  years  after  1681,  during  a</span><span>  period  when  Welsh  nationality</span><span>  wa6  at  its  lowest  ebb,  no  general</span><span>  eisteddfod  on  a  large  scale  was</span><span>  held  in  Wales  until  1S19.  At  the</span></p> <p><span>  close  of  the  Napoleonic  wars  there  ¡</span><span>  was  a  general  revival  of  Welsh</span><span>  nationality.

""Next  year  it  will</span><span>  be  different  and  we  will  have  every-</span><span>  thing  we  could  want,""  was  the</span><span>  comforting  assurance  people  offered</span></p> <p><span>  to.  themselves.  Nest  Christmas  came</span><span>  but  there  was  .still  a  striking  ab-</span><span>  sence  of  all  the  things  which</span><span>  hitherto  had  been  associated  with</span><span>  the  festive  season.  Excuses  were</span><span>  not  wanting-shortage  of  man-</span><span>  power  and  materials,  war  weariness</span><span>  and  so  on.  ""Never  mind/'  .  people</span><span>  said,  ""wait  till  next  year,  surely</span><span>  things  will  have  settled  down  by</span><span>  then  and  we  will  see  a  real  old-time</span><span>  Christmas  once  more.""  Next  year</span><span>  has  come  round  and  the  things  as-</span><span>  sociated  not  only  with  Christmas</span><span>  but  with  daily  existence  are  scarcer</span><span>  than  ever;  and,  what  is  worse,  very</span><span>  much*  dearer.  Even  the  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  Trades  and  Labour  Council  has</span><span>  noticed  that.  At  *  meeting  of  dele-</span><span>  gates  held-  last  week  the  Executive</span><span>  was  instructed  to  call  a  meeting  of</span><span>  all  unionists  in  Rockhampton  early</span><span>  in  the  New  Year  to  protest  against</span><span>  the  recent  increase  in  the  cost  of</span><span>  living.</span></p> <p><span>  But  if  tiie  shelves  in  the  stores</span></p> <p><span>  are  comparatively  bare  of  goods</span><span>  and  prices  are  steadily  mounting,</span><span>  the'  two  and  a  half  years  that  have</span><span>  elapsed  since  VP  Day  have  been</span><span>  marked  by  what  we  are  assured</span><span>  are  great  ""improvements""  in  the</span><span>  lot  of  the  people,  so  that  the  war</span><span>  was  not  fought  and  won  in  vain.</span><span>  Thé  40-hour  week  has  been</span><span>  achieved,  substantial  increases  made</span><span>  in  the  basic  wage  and  marginal</span><span>  rates,  conditions  in  the  workshops</span><span>  ""improved,""  so  much  that  produc</span><span>  dnction  per  unit  is  down  as  much</span><span>  as  40  per  cent  in  some  cases  com-</span><span>  pared  with  pre-war;  pensions  have</span><span>  increased,  and  social  services  ex-</span><span>  panded  until  they  promise  to  eat</span><span>  up  most  of  the  public  revenue</span><span>  1  within  a  year  or  two.</span></p> <p><span>  The  fly  i&  the  omtmeñt  is,  that</span><span>  there  is  an  insufficiency  of  goods</span><span>  required  by  the  community  and</span><span>  what  there  are  have  price  tags  ""that</span><span>  make  it  difficult  for  ordinary</span><span>  people  to  acquire  them.  Christmas-</span><span>  tide  is  nerhaps  not  the  best  season</span><span>  to  start  preaching  cause  and  effect</span><span>  in  matters  of  this  kind,  but  in</span><span>  view  of  the  meeting  of  unions</span></p> <p><span>  which  the  Executive  of  the  TLC  is</span><span>  to  convene  in  the  New  Year,  it</span><span>  might  do  no  harm  to  mention  them</span><span>  so  that  the  delegates  may  ruminate</span><span>  upon  the  subject  during  the  holi-</span><span>  days,  ?  especially  when  they  take</span><span>  note  of  the  things  now  missing</span><span>  from  their  Christmas  table  which</span><span>  were  there  in  abundance  before  the</span><span>  40-hour  week  and  go-slow  on  the</span><span>  job  were  even  visualised:</span></p> <p><span>  In  New  South  Wales  it  is</span><span>  claimed  that  the  40-hour  week  has</span><span>  raised  the  cost  of  running  the</span><span>  State  Bailways  by  £2,500,000  per</span><span>  ¡  annum,  whilst  output  per  man  has</span></p> <p><span>  fallen  to  65  per  cent  of  the  44-hour</span><span>  ¡week  output  Private  business</span><span>  executives  also  say  that  a  drop  in</span><span>  output  is  observable  in  some  in</span><span>  dustries^  far  greater  than  the  pro-</span><span>  portion'of  hours  reduction.  This</span></p> <p><span>  runs-somewhat  counter  to  the  con-</span><span>  tention  of  union  leaders  that  the</span><span>  shorter  working  week  must  lead  to</span><span>  greater  rather  than  to  lesser  pro-</span><span>  duction  per  unit.</span></p> <p><span>  What  are  the  reasons?  One  is</span><span>  the  notion  prevalent  in  certain</span><span>  militant  union  circles  that  to  go</span><span>  slow  and  spin  out  the  job  makes</span><span>  it  last  longer  and  improves  the</span><span>  chances  of  employment,  for  others.</span><span>  To  give  them  credit  this  fallacy</span><span>  is  exposed  by  capable  labour  lead-</span><span>  ers  within  and  outside  of  Aus-</span><span>  tralia.  There  is  only  one  way  to</span><span>  make  employment  for  all  and  pro-</span><span>  vide  cheaper  living  and  higher</span><span>  standards,  and  that  is  to  produce</span><span>  more  and  not  less  of  the  goods</span><span>  that  constitute  real  wealth,  and  so</span><span>  banish  shortages,  reduce  the  cost  of</span><span>  living  and  put  real  money  in  the</span><span>  family  purse.  To  slacken  effort  and</span><span>  produce  less  is  the  surest  method  of</span></p> <p><span>  increasing  prices  and  keeping  the</span><span>  shelves  of  the  stores  bare,  not  only</span><span>  at  Christmas,  but  at  all  times.</span></p> <p><span>  At  '  Christmas  1945  practically</span><span>  everyone  said  it  would  be  better  j</span><span>  next  year.  At  Christinas  1946  they</span><span>  said  surely  we  would  be  back  to</span><span>  something  like  .old  times  at  the  end</span><span>  of  another  year.  At  Christmas  1947)</span><span>  they  are  doubting  whether  things'</span></p> <p><span>  will  be  any  better\next  year;  in</span><span>  fact,  some  are  seriously  doubting</span><span>  that  they  ever  again  will  see  a</span><span>  Christmas  of  the  old  pre-war,  vint</span></p> <p><span>  jftge.  These  are  some  aspects  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  problem  which  the  unions  and  the</span><span>  Trades  and  Labour  Council  should</span><span>  discuss.  A  great  many  people  who</span><span>  are  not  members  of  unions,  but  are</span><span>  equally  concerned  about  th«  rise  in</span><span>  cost  of  living,  will  be  interested  in</span></p> <p><span>  their  findings  and  what  they  pro-</span><span>  pose  to  do  about  it.

Why  it  should  be  in</span><span>  such  a  hurry  to  get  on  with  the</span><span>  Bill  is  not  readily  discernible  in</span><span>  view  of  the  rumours  that  it  will  be</span><span>  in  no  mind  to  implement  it  when</span><span>  it  does  become  law,  and  also  in</span><span>  view  of  a  recent  recommendation</span><span>  by  the  chairman  of  the  Stevedor</span><span>  ing  Commission  that  the  legislation</span><span>  be  dropped  at  present.  The  real</span><span>  explanation  of  the  Government's</span><span>  spurt  to  get  the  Act  made  law  is</span><span>  probably  the  cracking  of  whips</span><span>  from  outside,  a  never  failing  tonic</span><span>  in  matters  of  th?  3  kind.</span></p> <p><span>  The  passage  of  the  Bill  landed</span><span>  the  Government  into  a  lot  of</span><span>  trouble  arising  not  so  much  from</span><span>  the  main  objects  of  the  measure</span><span>  as  from  gide  issues.  Firstly  it  led</span><span>  to  something  that  looks  perilously</span><span>  like  an  open  breach  between  two</span><span>  leading  ministers  and  their  respec-</span><span>  tive  adherents-no  light  matter  at</span><span>  a  time  when  the  atmosphere  is</span><span>  heavily  charged  with  talk  of  the</span><span>  possibilities  of  a  Government</span><span>  ""split.""

It  wa«</span><span>  pointed  out  that  whilst  many  pages</span><span>  of  the  annual  report  were  devoted</span><span>  to  a  variety  of""  subjects  of  gen-</span><span>  eral  interest,  only  four  Unes  were</span><span>  given  over  to  what  had  been  done</span><span>  about  price  fixing  and  rationing,</span><span>  two  of  the  most  vital  questions</span><span>  affecting  trade  and  commerce  to-</span><span>  day.  In  singling  out  matters  which</span></p> <p><span>  ware  more  the  concern  of  other</span><span>  bodies  than  the  Chamber  of  Com.</span><span>  maree  it  was  suggested  that  the</span><span>  incorporation  of  tiie  seaside  re-</span><span>  sorts  in  Greater  Rockhampton  was</span><span>  something  that  should  be  left  to</span><span>  the  Local  Authorities  concerned,</span></p> <p><span>  whilst  securing  telephone  stations</span><span>  for  the  convenience  of  motorists</span><span>  waa  one  for  the  Automobile</span></p> <p><span>  Clubs.</span></p> <p><span>  The  lessons  of  this  reproof  might</span><span>  well  be  absorbed  by  aft  publie  and</span><span>  semi-public  bodies.  Lately  there  has</span><span>  been  complaint  of  encroachment,</span><span>  due  either  to  excess  of  «eal  on  the</span><span>  part  of  members  of  other  organisa-</span><span>  tions  pr  tq  there  being  too  many  as-</span><span>  sociations  with  not  enough  to</span><span>  do.  There  is  a  tendency,  too,</span><span>  to  open  un  new  projects  whilst</span><span>  others  of  long  standing  and  of</span><span>  perhaps  greater  merit  sink  into</span><span>  abeyance.  For  example  in  the  cur-</span><span>  rent  spate  of  ideas  as  to  what  had</span><span>  beet  be  done  to  improve  the  ship-</span><span>  ping  position,  ranging  from  the</span><span>  Pirate  Point  cut  to  handing  over</span><span>  the  affairs  of  the  Harbour  Board</span><span>  to  the  Government,  no  mention  is</span><span>  made  of  road  connexion  with  and</span><span>  land  reclatnation  at  Port  Alma,</span><span>  whieh  has  often  been  offered  AS  tbe</span><span>  solution  of  the  matter.</span></p> <p><span>  One  thins;  that  never  fails  to  be</span><span>  well  ventilated  at  these  annual</span></p> <p><span>  meetings  is  the  apathy  pf  «he  bueï</span></p> <p><span>  nMaman  who  fails  to  show  an  in-</span><span>  terest  in  the  affairs  of  his  city  by</span><span>  attendanoe  at  meetings.  Specifically</span><span>  %  is  oited  tnat  the  Chamber  itself,</span><span>  with  500  members,  rarely  raises</span><span>  two  score  at  the  regular  meetings,</span><span>  and  not  more  than  160  at  the  an-</span><span>  nual  gathering.  Perhaps  too  much</span><span>  strew  eau  be  laid,  on  this,  without</span><span>  excusing  the  lasy  and  apathetic</span><span>  and  the  still  less  défendable  indi-</span><span>  vidual  who  will  not  attend  meet-</span><span>  ings  or  take  any  office,  but  is  a</span><span>  keen  enough  critic  of  what  ia  being</span><span>  done  or  attempted  by  others.  The</span><span>  Chamber  would  have  greater</span><span>  grounds  for  complaint  if  it  had</span><span>  only  60  members  when  it  should</span><span>  have  SOO,  and  so  long  as  it  has  ar</span><span>  activa  executive  which  realises  th«</span><span>  power  that  a  commercial  organisa</span><span>  tion  with  a  membership  of  50(</span><span>  gives  them  and  uses  it  when  neceg</span><span>  sary,  the  influence  of  the  body  wil</span><span>  not  be  weakened  if  large  attend-</span><span>  ances  axe  not  the  regular  thing.  A1</span><span>  the  same  time  it  would  do  *,  loi</span><span>  of  good  to  men  who  imagine  thei</span><span>  bare  not  the  time  to  make  om</span><span>  night  a  month  available  for  th&lt;</span><span>  Chamber  meeting,  even  if  th«</span><span>  bowling  session  has  to  suffer,</span><span>  though  it  need  not  necessarily  di</span></p> <p><span>  so.</span></p> <p><span>  From  tbe  speeches  at  these  an</span><span>  nual  gatherings  one  would  ga  the</span><span>  that  the  most  ardent  desire  of  th</span><span>  elected  is  that  there  should  b</span><span>  keen  competition  for  office,  am</span><span>  that  they  should  run  the  gauntle</span><span>  of  an  election.  There  may  be  les</span><span>  than  a  full  measure  of  sincerity  ii</span><span>  this,  for  if  there  is  one  thing  tha</span><span>  gets  the  average  person's  back  ut</span><span>  it  is  to  bo  opposed  and  beaten  fo</span><span>  an  elective  office.

Frequent  reit-</span><span>  eration  has  more  or  less  fixed  in</span><span>  the  public  mind  that  lack  of  par-</span><span>  ental  control  and  slum  conditions</span><span>  of  living  are  the  sole  causes  of</span><span>  this  grave  social  ill,  and  that  if</span><span>  parents  were  to  spare  the  rod  less</span><span>  and  slum  areas  were  to  be  abol-</span><span>  ished  all  would  be  well.</span></p> <p><span>  Those  who  are  more  closely  as-</span><span>  sociated  with  the  matter  know</span><span>  that  there  are  many  contributing</span><span>  causes  to  child  waywardness.  They</span><span>  know,  too,  that  preventive  ^  mea-</span><span>  sures  are  neither  few  nor  simple,</span><span>  but  in/olve  much  hard  work  and</span><span>  6kill  and  sympathy  of  others  bo-,</span><span>  sides  parents.  Notwithstanding  the</span><span>  serious  attention  given  to  the</span><span>  problem  in  many  countries,  how-</span><span>  ever,  there  does  not  appear  to</span><span>  have'  been  compiled  a  sample</span></p> <p><span>  manual  which  would  serve  as  a</span><span>  guide  to  those  addressing  them-</span><span>  selves  to  the  problem  wherever  it</span><span>  may  exist.  That  omission  seems</span><span>  about  to  be  rectified.</span></p> <p><span>  The  findings  of  the  first  National</span></p> <p><span>  Conference  for  the  prevention  and</span><span>  Control  of  Juvenile  Delinquency</span><span>  recently  held  at  Washington  USA,</span><span>  will  be  of  great  interest  to  other</span><span>  countries,  including  Australia.  One</span><span>  of  the  first  findings  of  the  confer-</span><span>  ence  was  that  ''prevention  and</span><span>  control""  primarily  depend  upon</span><span>  local  action.  This  should  prove  a</span><span>  wholesome  corrective  to  those  who</span><span>  whilst  acknowledging  the  presence</span><span>  of  the  ill  and  ""  e  need  for  action,</span><span>  are  content  to  ""pasg  the  buck""  on</span><span>  the  plea  that  it  is  a  national  .ques-</span><span>  tion.  Local  action  in  its  true</span><span>  sense  means  action  in  s  particular</span><span>  locality,  then  the  town  or  city</span><span>  i^elf,  before  wider  responsibility</span><span>  can  be  allocated.  Once  the  respons-</span><span>  ibility  for  local  action  is  ac-</span><span>  knowledged  there  will  be  less  indif-</span><span>  ference  to  the  various  youth  wel-</span><span>  fare  movements  that,  in  far  too</span><span>  many  instances,  are  allowed  to</span><span>  drag.</span></p> <p><span>  The  purpose  of  the  Washington</span><span>  conference  was  to  bring  together</span><span>  for  the  first  time  representatives</span><span>  of  all  the  various  agencies  and  or-</span><span>  ganisations,  national,  State,  and</span><span>  local,  having  to  do  with  the  prob-</span><span>  lems  of  juveniles.  It  succeeded,  in</span><span>  that  purpose  since  it  drew  to-</span><span>  gether  the  best  experience  of  the</span><span>  country,  and  out  of  the  deliber-</span><span>  ations  came  recommendations  for</span><span>  greatly  accelerated  programmes</span><span>  for  controlling  and  alleviating  the</span><span>  problem  of  juvenile  waywardness</span><span>  and  crime.  The  recommendations</span><span>  include  slum  clearance,  better</span><span>  housing,  broad  reforms  in  the  in-</span><span>  stitutional  treatment  of  children,</span><span>  parental  education,  church  partici-</span><span>  pation  and  enlargement  of  school</span></p> <p><span>  facilities  to  provide  special  help</span><span>  ments  in  the  Court  handling  of</span><span>  juvenile  cases  and  plan«  for  arous-</span><span>  ing  the  interest  of  -the  entire  com-</span><span>  munity  in  meeting  and  solving</span></p> <p><span>  the  problem  in  their  midst,  were  I</span><span>  brought  for  ard.</span></p> <p><span>  The  reports  and  recommend-</span><span>  ations  were  regarded  as  the  most</span><span>  comprehensive  blue  print  ever</span><span>  drawn  up  on  the  subject,  but  it</span><span>  was  admitted  that  the  success  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  conference  would  depend  upon</span><span>  the  attitude  in  which  communities</span><span>  themselves  moved  forward  to</span><span>  adopt  the  blue  print.  One  of  the</span><span>  outstanding  reports  was  that  of</span><span>  the  panel  on  housing,  Which  re-</span><span>  commended  a  national  policy  of</span><span>  low  cost  housing  for  low  income</span><span>  groups.  In  this  connexion  it  was</span><span>  conceded  that  this  was  not  alone</span><span>  the  responsibility  of  the  govern-</span><span>  ment,  but  the  cooperation  of</span><span>  builders,  banks  and  labour  was</span><span>  sought  in  bringing  down  the  cost</span><span>  of  construction,  present  methods</span><span>  of  treatment  of  children  in  train</span></p> <p><span>  j  ing  schools  was  renounced  by  the</span></p> <p><span>  panel  on  the  institutional  treat-</span><span>  ment  of  children.  The  need  for</span><span>  complete  overhaul  and  reform  of</span><span>  the  system  was  emphasised.  The</span><span>  present  training  schools  were  scath-</span><span>  ingly  denounced  as  dumping</span><span>  grounds  where  not  only  delinquents</span><span>  but  the  mentally  ill,  feeble</span><span>  minded,  and  physically  '  disabled</span><span>  children  are  all  thrown  together.</span></p> <p><span>  ¡  The  conference,  as  a  whole,</span><span>  charged  itself  with  the  respons-</span><span>  ibility  of  carrying  this  broader</span><span>  more  active  approach  to  the  juve-</span><span>  nile  problem  into  local  communi-</span><span>  ties,  and  publicising  the  confer-</span><span>  ence  reports  through  the  local</span><span>  Press,  radio,  and  motion  picture</span><span>  facilities.  Most  important  is  that</span></p> <p><span>  summaries  of  all  the  conference</span><span>  panels  are  to  be  made  available  in</span><span>  pamphlet  form  and  distributed  on</span><span>  the  widest  possible  scale.</span></p> <p><span>  Whilst  the  conference  was  a</span><span>  purely  American  convention  it</span><span>  dealt  with  a  problem  that  has  no</span><span>  geographical  boundaries,  and  mea-</span><span>  sures  of  prevention  and  cure  could</span><span>  be  given  an  equally  wide  applica-</span><span>  tion.  For  that  reason  the  sum-</span><span>  maries  and  recommendations</span><span>  should  be  of  great  help  to  Aus-</span><span>  tralia,  since  they  are  to  be  got  up</span><span>  in  handy  form.  It  will  be  hoped</span><span>  that  some  agency-perhaps  the</span><span>  Commonwealth  Department  of  In-</span><span>  formation  which  has  ramifications</span><span>  in  the  United  StateB-will  be  suf-</span></p> <p><span>  ficiently  interested  to  obtain  copies</span><span>  for  distribution  in  this  country.</span></p> <p><span>  Improve</span></p> ",Article,1947-06-02,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON MONDAY, JUNE 2, 1947.

Any</span><span>  tendency  to  exaltation  is  subdued</span><span>  on  recalling  that  there  are  few</span><span>  things  of  which  science  knows</span></p> <p><span>  less  than  it  does  of  the  common</span><span>  cold.</span></p> <p><span>  Until  September  last,  when  it</span><span>  was  first  released  for  civilian  use,</span><span>  not  many  folk  had  heard-other</span><span>  than  under  the  direst  '""hush-hush""</span></p> <p><span>  precautions  -  the  word  streptomy-</span><span>  cin.  The  more  knowledgeable  of</span><span>  those  that  did  knew  that  it  was</span><span>  another  of  the  ""necklace""  anti-</span><span>  biotics,  which  means  that  it  is  a</span><span>  substance,  arranged  like  a  string</span><span>  of  beads,  that  is  produced  by</span><span>  micro-organisma  and  is  capable  of</span><span>  declaring  war  on  bacteria.  Many</span><span>  of  the  bacteria  which  play  havoc</span><span>  with  man's  health  and  push  up</span><span>  the  death  rate  in  unexpected</span><span>  places  have  been  brought  to  heel</span><span>  by  one  antibiotic  or  another,  hut</span><span>  there  remained  some  ""tough  guys""</span><span>  that  defied  all  attempts  at  then</span><span>  subjection.  These  latter  are  said</span><span>  to  be  ""Gram  negative,""  i.e.,  they</span><span>  refuse  to  be  stained  by  the  Gram</span><span>  method  of  bringing  bacteria  under</span><span>  observation,  and  so  left  science</span><span>  looking  down  its  nose  through  an</span><span>  unseeing  microscope.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  not  claimed,  however,  that</span><span>  streptomycin  has  brought  under</span><span>  control  all  of  these  hard  cases,  but</span><span>  it  has  subdued  some  quite  impor-</span><span>  tant  ones.  Influençai  meningitis,  ai</span><span>  disease  with  high  death  rate,  has</span><span>  been  shorn  by  the  new  drug  of  its</span><span>  terrors;  while  urinary  tract  in-</span><span>  fections-many  of  them  considered</span></p> <p><span>  for  20  years  to  be  incurable-have</span><span>  also  yielded  to  it.  It  has  proved</span><span>  efficacious  in  peritonitis,  in  blood</span><span>  stream  infections  and  in  sinuses.</span><span>  While  the  tubercle  bacillus  is  sen-</span><span>  sitive  to  streptomycin,  its  evalua-</span><span>  tion  ""in  the  treatment  bf  tuber  cu-,</span><span>  losis,  despite  much  premature</span><span>  speculation,  needs  time,""  but</span><span>  human  clinical  trials  are  in  pro-</span><span>  gress.

A.  Wakeman,  of  Rutgers</span><span>  University,  New  Jersey,  after</span><span>  some  years'  antibiotic  research,</span><span>  and  went'straight  into  the  fighting</span><span>  forces.  It  comes  from  origins  as</span><span>  prosaic  as  its  success  proved  to  be</span><span>  dramatic,  being  tracked  down  to</span><span>  specific  strains  of  a  germ-killing</span><span>  soil  organism  originally  isolated</span><span>  from  heavily  manured  soil  and-of</span><span>  all  places  on  earth-r-the  throat  of</span><span>  a  chicken-  Later,  .  the  types  of  soil</span><span>  were  expanded  and  some  peats  were</span><span>  included.  But  isolating  the  strain</span><span>  was  only  one  step  in  the  manufac-</span><span>  ture  of  the  new  arrival,  for  only</span><span>  if  the  strain  of  the  soil  organism</span><span>  is  grown  on  a  specific  medium  will</span><span>  it  produce  or  create  streptomycin.</span><span>  In  its  turn,  this  ""medium  must</span><span>  possess  certain  chemical  character-</span><span>  istics  that,  odd  as  it  may  seem,</span><span>  are  still-  unidentified.  Chemist*</span></p> <p><span>  are  still  probing,  Jbut  so,  far  ac</span><span>  they  can  gather  these  characteris-</span><span>  tics  appear  to  be  lodged  in  meat</span><span>  extract,  in  the  liquor  in  which</span><span>  corn  has  been  steeped,  and  in</span><span>  some  yeast  preparations.

By  far  the  largest</span><span>  consumer  of  streptomycin  ia  tuber-</span><span>  culosis,  treatment  of  which  is  still</span><span>  in  the  experimental  stage.  What</span><span>  places  streptomycin  at  the  head  of</span><span>  the  list  of  known  bacteria  fighters</span><span>  is  that  it  can  be  turned  loose</span><span>  among  most  of  the  worst  charac-</span><span>  ters  and  at  least  come  to  no</span></p> <p><span>  harm,  where  penicillin  would  prob-</span><span>  ably  take  the  count  early  in  the</span><span>  fray.  This  factor  makes  of  it  ""a</span><span>  valuable  partner-  to  penicillin.""</span><span>  Just  how  far  that  character  can</span><span>  be  sustained,  or  with  what  other</span><span>  substances  streptomycin  can  be</span><span>  linked  as  it  were  to  work  in</span><span>  double  harness  has  still  to  be</span><span>  demonstrated.  But  science  is  hard</span><span>  at  work,  and  while  it  has  some</span><span>  very  bright  hopes  the  men  who</span><span>  puddle  among  the  odds  and  end«</span><span>  of  things  that  Dame  Nature  car</span><span>  ríes  in  her  vanity  bag  are  not</span><span>  presenting  us  with  any  unfinished</span><span>  curative  symphonies.  But  so  fai</span><span>  as  they  have  told  us,  and  so  fai</span><span>  as  they  have  limited  the  publie</span><span>  .use  of  streptomycin  to  assailing</span><span>  bacteria,  on  which  it  is  known  U</span><span>  be  effective,  several  very  grin:</span><span>  dangers  bave  been  removed  fron</span><span>  man's  ;  progress  through  life.

There</span><span>  is  little  hope  of  any  of  them  being</span><span>  returned  but  their  presence  may</span><span>  I  give  a  curious  turn  to  the  elec-</span></p> <p><span>  tion,  and  ig  indeed  said  to  be  dis-</span><span>  concerting  to  the  Premier  and  his</span><span>  I  election  managers.  The  ""first</span><span>  I  past  the  post""  amendment  to  the</span><span>  Electoral  Act,  which  abolished</span><span>  preferential  voting  and  served  the</span><span>  Government  well  at  several  by</span><span>  elections,  may  now  prove  a</span><span>  boomerang  in  that  the  Independent</span><span>  Labour  men-they  are  nearly  all</span><span>  standing  for  Labour-held  seats</span><span>  will  take  away  sufficient  votes</span><span>  from  the  endorsed  candidate  to</span></p> <p><span>  permit  the  Opposition  man  to  lead</span><span>  on  the  initial  count,  though  he</span><span>  might  not  win  on  a  preference</span><span>  vote.  It  is  freely  canvassed  in</span><span>  Brisbane  that  bad  this  develop-</span><span>  ment  been  foreseen  before  the</span><span>  recent  A.L.P.  conference  at  Towns-</span><span>  ville,  there  would  have  been  a</span><span>  swift  manoeuvre  on  the  part  of</span><span>  the  Government  to  get  back  to</span><span>  preferential  voting.

It  is  too</span><span>  near  the  event  to  be  precise,  but</span><span>  the  world  knows  of  the  tremen-</span><span>  dous  wealth  of  aid  that  poured  east</span><span>  across  the  Atlantic  to  battered</span><span>  Britain  from  the  two  countries</span></p> <p><span>  lately  toured  by  their  Majesties.</span></p> <p><span>  The  King  and  Queen,  accompan-</span><span>  ied  by  the  Princesses,  have  just</span><span>  completed  a  nine  weeks'  6942-mile</span><span>  tour  of  South  Africa,  finishing  bril-</span><span>  liantly  at  Cape  Town  on  the  21st</span><span>  anniversary  of  the  birth  of  Prin-</span><span>  cess  Elizabeth,  heir  presumptive</span><span>  to  the  throne  of  the  British  Em-</span><span>  pire.  The  current  popular  belief  is</span><span>  that  this  was  merely  a  tour  for</span><span>  collecting  addresses  of  loyalty  and</span><span>  strings  of  diamonds,  or  for  the</span><span>  future  Queen  of  England  to  give</span><span>  five  dances  to  a  young  Air  Force</span><span>  officer  who  was  on  the  verge  of  be-</span><span>  ing  thrown  out  by  the  Master  of</span><span>  Ceremonies  for  daring  to  appear</span><span>  minus  the  traditional  white  gloves.</span><span>  If  that  be  so,  then  the  folly  of  the</span><span>  nit-wits  at  Whitehall  emulated</span></p> <p><span>  Queen  Mary  of  England  in  1558.</span><span>  She  said,  ""When  I  am  dead,  Calais</span><span>  will  be  found  written  on  my</span><span>  heart,""  and  shrewd  observers  reck-</span><span>  oned  that  an  X-ray  of  the  hearts</span><span>  of  Whitehall  nit-wits  would  dis-</span><span>  close  the  word  ""Mediterranean""</span><span>  written  there.  That  was  before  the</span><span>  South  African  Royal  tour  and  an</span><span>  amended  suggestion  might  be  that</span><span>  inspection  would  see  that  word</span><span>  scored  put  and  ""South  Africa""  in</span><span>  scribed  in  its  place.</span></p> <p><span>  The  greater  part  of  Britain's</span><span>  troubles  in  the  Near  East  and</span><span>  India  lie  in  the  fact  that  the</span><span>  Hindus  and  Jews  and  Moslems  be-</span></p> <p><span>  lieve  they  have  her  ""by  the  short</span><span>  hair,""  and  may  sever  her  ""life-line</span><span>  with  the  east""  if  she  fails  to  re-</span><span>  spond  to  reason.  From  Gibraltar</span></p> <p><span>  to  Java  that  life-line  is  lined  by</span><span>  Moslems  who  want  the  Jews</span></p> <p><span>  thrown  out  of  Palestine,  the</span><span>  Hindus  subjugated  in  India  and  the</span><span>  Sudanese  brought  under  the  mantle</span><span>  of  the  prophet.  The  Hindus,  who</span><span>  outnumber  the  Moslems  in  India</span><span>  by  three  to  one,  yearn  for  the</span><span>  power  of  many  over  the  few,  and</span><span>  the  Jews  do  not  care  what  the</span><span>  Arabs  get  so  long  as  it  is  not</span><span>  Palestine.  This  amiable  trio,</span><span>  clutching  at  each  other's  throat  as</span><span>  they  straddle  Britain's  road  to  the</span><span>  east-of  which  they  form  no  incon-</span><span>  siderable  part-would  be  less  vo-</span><span>  ciferous  but  for  the  belief  that  a</span><span>  Britain  cut  off  from  the  east  would</span></p> <p><span>  soon  be  in  a  bad  way.  On  top  of</span><span>  this  is  the  fact  that  both  Egypt</span><span>  and  India  are  in  process  of  attain-</span><span>  ing  their  independence-British</span><span>  have  now  to  register  in  India-and</span><span>  are  not  including  tolerance  in  their</span><span>  preparations  for  celebrating  that</span><span>  event.  In  the  circumstances,  that</span><span>  Britain  during  peace  would  have</span><span>  the  use  of  the  Mediterranean  is  as</span><span>  unquestionable  as  that  she  would</span><span>  find  herself  walking  a  tight  rope</span><span>  there  in  case  of  war,  with  more</span><span>  than  a  chance  of  there  being  a</span><span>  fanatic  working  on  both  ends  of</span><span>  the  rope  with  a  knife.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  little  reason  to  doubt</span><span>  that,  with  Britain  less  dependent</span><span>  upon  the  wild  men  who  are  gesticu-</span><span>  lating  along  her  so  called  ""life-line</span><span>  to  the  east""  they  would  be  much</span></p> <p><span>  more  amenable  to  reason.  Re-</span></p> <p><span>  adjustment  of  Empire  preferences</span><span>  may  also  difert  trade  from  one-</span><span>  time  Empire  dependencies  that</span><span>  have  become  independent,  so  that</span><span>  the  value  of  the  'life-line""  would</span><span>  be  less  than  it  was.  Hence  it  ap-</span><span>  pears  that  Whitehall  bunglers  are</span><span>  turning  their  attention  to  building</span><span>  up  the  Union  of  South  Africa  into</span><span>  the  greatest  of  all  Empire  out-</span><span>  posts.

Another  undesirable</span><span>  trend  is  that  timekeeping  is  poor,</span><span>  so  that  the  nest  periods  tend  to</span><span>  exceed  allotted  intervals,  work</span><span>  takes  longer  to  get  under  way  and</span><span>  tools  are  downed  before  the,  recog-</span><span>  nised  time  for  ending  work.</span></p> <p><span>  This  ie  not  a.  pretty  picture,  and</span><span>  certainly  ia  not  what  was  visual-</span><span>  ised  by  the  old-time  champions  of</span><span>  the  ""right  to  work,""  or  those  who</span><span>  visualised  a  happy,  contented  com-</span><span>  munity  when  there  should  be  full</span><span>  employment  for  all.

"<p><span>  Ofje  iilorning  bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAAIPION</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  APRIL  7,  1947.</span><span>  EASTER  ATTRACTIONS</span></p> <p><span>  With  our  bandsmen  at  Mary-</span><span>  borough  and  the  Musical  Union  at</span><span>  Bundaberg  this  Easter,  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  lends  support  to  the  cul-</span><span>  tural  ambitions  of  neighbouring</span></p> <p><span>  cities.  For  its  own  entertain-</span><span>  ment  it  contents  itself  with</span></p> <p><span>  sporting  attractions  in  the  shape</span><span>  of  the  RJC  Easter  race  meeting</span><span>  and  the  State  regatta.  There  is  j</span><span>  HO  reason  to  quarrel  with  the</span><span>  arrangement  so  long  as  it  is  not  j</span><span>  to  be  one  of  permanency.  It  will  j</span><span>  be  found  to  be  a  wholesome  pro-1</span><span>  ceeding  to  reverse  the  order  once</span><span>  in  a  while.</span></p> <p><span>  Easter  is  the  appropriate  time</span><span>  fpr  Queensland's  musical  festivals,</span><span>  the  holiday  spread  and  the  cli-</span><span>  matic  conditions  alike  being  bet-</span><span>  ter  suited  than  at  any  other  part</span><span>  of  the  year.  ?  Rockhampton  has</span><span>  well-founded  claims  as  a  cultural</span><span>  .centre  and  as  they  have  proved</span><span>  in  open  competition,  our  musical</span><span>  organisations  can  hold  their  own</span><span>  with  the  State's  best.  Hence  it</span><span>  is  fitting  that  we  should  take  our</span><span>  turn  in  conducting  both  Band  Con-</span><span>  test  and  Eisteddfod  in  order  that</span><span>  the  citizens  of  Rockhampton  may</span><span>  enjoy  the  pleasures  which  they</span><span>  brinv  to  so  many.</span></p> <p><span>  It  iá  several  years  since  we  had</span><span>  a  band  contest,  and  further  back</span><span>  still  since  the  last  Queensland</span><span>  Eisteddfod  was  held  here.  The  in-</span><span>  trusion  of  the  war  was  in  part</span><span>  accountable,  but  it  is  not  the</span><span>  sole  reason.  Neither  band  con-</span><span>  test  nor  eisteddfod  is  a  self</span></p> <p><span>  supporting  enterprise  and  both  de-</span><span>  mand  a  measure  of  public  finan-</span><span>  cial  aid  and  a  still  greater  mea-</span><span>  sure  of  voluntary  labour.  When</span><span>  sounded  out  about  undertaking  a</span><span>  band  contest  or  eisteddfod  there</span><span>  has  been  some  hesitancy  about</span><span>  shouldering  the  task.  That  com-</span><span>  plex  should  be  got  rid  of.  If  it</span><span>  put  its  mind  to  it  Rockhampton</span><span>  would  have  little  difficulty  in  pro-</span><span>  viding  both  cash  and  workers.</span></p> <p><span>  It  would""  be  worth  the  effort.</span><span>  There  is  no  better  means  of</span><span>  creating  goodwill  between  com-</span><span>  munities  and  of  adding  something</span><span>  to  the  lives  of  those  who  partici-</span><span>  pate.  To  go  away  with  band  or</span><span>  choir,  or  even  to  compete  at  home,</span><span>  is  something  to  look  forward  to</span><span>  with  anticipation  and  oftimes</span><span>  something  to  look  back  on  with</span><span>  pleasure.  Friendships  are  widened</span><span>  and  goodwill  grows.  This  Easter</span><span>  our  oandsmen  at  Maryborough</span><span>  and  our  choristers  at  Bundaberg</span><span>  are  receiving  courtesies  and  kind-</span><span>  nesses  which  it  behoves  us  to  re-</span></p> <p><span>  pay,  and  this  we'can  only  do  by</span><span>  creating  a  similar  occasion  in  our</span><span>  own'  centre  to  bring  along  the</span><span>  players  and  the  singers  of  those</span></p> <p><span>  cities.</span></p> <p><span>  But  if  Rockhampton  is  to  go  in</span><span>  for  these  things  we  shall  require</span><span>  better  accommodation  for  them.</span><span>  The  need  for  a  public  auditorium</span><span>  better  than  ,*.nythiug  we  possess</span><span>  outside  the  privately-owned</span><span>  theatres  has  long  passed  the  stage</span><span>  of  debate.  .  Now  that  the  School</span><span>  of  Arts  has  been  taken  over  by</span><span>  the  municipality  the  obstacle  of</span><span>  finance  is  removed,  and  no-one</span><span>  doubts  that  just  as  soon  as  it</span><span>  can  get  the  materials  and  the</span><span>  labour  the  City  Council  will  set</span><span>  about  providing  an  auditorium</span><span>  that  will  meet  the  requirements.</span><span>  That,  however,  may  take  some</span></p> <p><span>  years.</span></p> <p><span>  Whilst  our  musicians  are  away</span><span>  Rockhampton  is  entertaining  the</span><span>  rowing  men  of  Queensland  at  a</span><span>  State  regatta.  Now  that  the  war</span><span>  is  over  it  is  pleasing  to  see  the</span><span>  youth  of  the  country  returning  to</span><span>  the  manly  sports.  Rockhampton</span></p> <p><span>  is  favoured  in  many  ways  and  in  \</span><span>  none  more  than  the  possession  of  j</span><span>  the  great  river  which  flows  liv</span><span>  its  door,  not  the  least  of  whose</span><span>  recommendations  are  the  facili-</span><span>  ties  it  offers  for  healthy  outdoor</span><span>  recreation.  Rockhampton  always</span><span>  has  held  its  own  with  the  State's</span><span>  leading  rowing  centres,  but  the</span></p> <p><span>  number  of  our  young  men  who  \</span><span>  participate  in  this  manly  sport  is  j</span><span>  perhaps  below  what  it  should  be,  ]</span><span>  especially  in  view  of  the  dis-  !</span></p> <p><span>  coifxaging  reports  now  current  of  j</span><span>  the  state  of  physical  fitness  j</span></p> <p><span>  boasted  by  Australia's  young  man-</span><span>  hood.  Like  eisteddfodau  and</span></p> <p><span>  band  contests,  rowing  is  not  a  j</span></p> <p><span>  commercial  proposition  and  here  \</span><span>  again  there  is  a  need  for  public</span><span>  support  and  encouragement  for</span><span>  those  enthusiasts  who  give  their</span><span>  time  and  energies  to  its  promotion.</span></p> <p><span>  The  value  of  the  RJC  Easter  j</span><span>  race  meeting  need  not  be  .  dis-  j</span><span>  counted  on  any  account.  The</span><span>  countryman  also  must  have  his</span><span>  break  from  the  daily  routine  and</span></p> <p><span>  he  finds  it  in  a  visit  to  the  nearest</span></p> <p><span>  city  where  a  race  meeting  is</span><span>  listed.  Because  of  the  race  meet-</span><span>  ing  many  will  find  Rockhampton</span><span>  an  attractive  place  this  Easter,</span><span>  whereas  without  it  they  would</span><span>  have  voted  the  city  a  dull  spot,</span><span>  though  we  offered  them  band  con-</span><span>  test  and  eisteddfod  as  well  as  the</span><span>  regatta.  Each  to  his  taste  is  a</span><span>  good  rule,  but  it  is  a  wise  thing</span><span>  for  cities,  as  for  promoters  in</span><span>  other  spheres,  to  see  that  all</span></p> <p><span>  tastes  are  catered  for.</span></p> ",Article,1947-04-07,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON MONDAY, APRIL 7, 1947.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  BOOKHAMPTON</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  MAY  26,  1947</span><span>  SHRINKING  HOUSES</span></p> <p><span>  Of  the  many  unsatisfactory  as-</span></p> <p><span>  pects  of  housing  in  Queensland,</span><span>  none  is  more  disturbing  than  that</span><span>  revealed  in  reports  of  alarming</span><span>  deterioration  in  the  condition  of</span><span>  homes  erected  within  the  past  two</span><span>  years.  The  ""Bulletin's""  Brisbane</span><span>  correspondent,  writing  last  week,</span><span>  stated  that  people  -who  had  had</span><span>  houses  erected  within  the  past  two</span><span>  or  three  years  are  greatly  con-</span><span>  cerned  about  the  way  the  timber  is</span><span>  shrinking.  The  floors  in  one  modest</span><span>  cottage  that  cost  £1100,  and</span><span>  were  of  tongued  and  grooved  tim-</span><span>  ber  of  apparently  good  quality,</span><span>  are  now  letting  in  the  daylight.  In</span><span>  others  the  walls  are  gaping,  win-</span><span>  dows  and  doors  either  will  not</span></p> <p><span>  open  or  refuse  to  shut,  and  cracks</span><span>  are  appearing  everywhere.  Some  of</span><span>  the  owners  are  returned  servicemen</span><span>  and  other  have  sunk  their  life's</span><span>  savings  in  utter  rubbish.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  obvious  that  big  trouble</span><span>  is  ia  store  ipr  these  unfortunate</span></p> <p><span>  people.  If  such  a  state  of  affairs  is</span><span>  at  all  widespread  it  amounts  to  a</span><span>  soandal  and  there  can  be  no  ques-</span><span>  tion  that  the  Government  should</span><span>  act  before  more  home  builders  are</span><span>  victimised,  to  discover  where  the</span><span>  fault  lies.  There  is  a  ready  sus-</span><span>  picion  as  to  where  a  lot  of  it  lies</span><span>  --that  is  the  unhappy  trend  in  far</span><span>  too  many  avenues  of  getting  the</span></p> <p><span>  most  for  the  least  amount  of  ser-</span></p> <p><span>  vice.  T&6  theory  that  all  the  good</span><span>  timber  and  workman  ship  became</span><span>  exhausted  during  the  war  should</span></p> <p><span>  not  be  entertained  for  a  moment,</span></p> <p><span>  but  ft  it  apparent  that  inferior</span><span>  materials  and  shoddy  workman-</span><span>  ship  has  taken  the  place  of  the</span><span>  reliability  in  both  that  distin-</span><span>  guished  Australian  borne,  building  a</span><span>  few  yoan  ago.  Tais  is  an  unfort-</span><span>  unate  legacy  of  tiie  'war,  when</span><span>  swift  construction  regardless  of</span><span>  cost  created  a  condition  that  should</span><span>  have  ended  with  the  passing  Of  the</span><span>  urgency  in  defence  needs.</span></p> <p><span>  But  the  causes  are  of  less.con-</span><span>  cern  than  the  measures  required</span><span>  to  stop  practices  that  will  give</span><span>  post-war  housing  a  bad  name.  In</span><span>  years  to  come  home  purchasers</span><span>  will  demand  heavy  discount  on  ac-</span><span>  count  of  any  property  being  ""of  im-</span><span>  mediate  post-war  construction,</span><span>  which  will  react  again  to  the  own-</span><span>  er's  disadvantage.  Many  people</span><span>  who  today  are  laying  out  their</span><span>  savings  in  costly  homes  console</span><span>  themselves  with  the  thought  that</span><span>  ""the  value  will  always  be  there.""</span><span>  These  revelations  suggest  that  so</span><span>  far  as  timber  is  concerned  the</span><span>  value  is  not  there  now  and  will</span><span>  depreciate  still  farther  as  time  goes</span><span>  on.  Noshing  could  have  a  worse</span><span>  effect  on  the  bousing  problem  gen-</span><span>  erally.  If  people  in  need  of  homes,</span><span>  and  in  a  position  to  pay  for  them</span><span>  immediately  labour  and  materials</span><span>  become  available,  drop  the  idea  for</span><span>  fear  of  ending  up  with  a  building</span><span>  of  the  type  described  in  tile  fore-</span><span>  going  message  '  quoted  from  Bris-</span><span>  bane,  it  will  throw  house  construc-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  completely  out  of  gear  and</span><span>  delay  the  solution  of  Australia's</span><span>  most  urgent  need  ipr  very  many</span></p> <p><span>  years.</span></p> <p><span>  Thus  is  further  evidence  provided</span><span>  of  the  futility  of  the  Housing</span><span>  Commissions  that  investigated  the</span><span>  problem  before  the  war,  and  now</span><span>  control  its  execution.  The  Commis-</span><span>  sion  that  went  roving'  the  country</span><span>  in  tile  mid-war  years,  seeking  to</span><span>  ascertain  tile  kind  of  home  people</span><span>  would  like  to  live  in,  should  have</span><span>  been  addressing  itself  to  ensuring</span><span>  that  stocks-  of  suitable  timber</span><span>  were  kept  up  to  meet  the  building</span><span>  demand  when  it  was  permissible  to</span><span>  make  a  start.  The  present  housing</span><span>  and  building  control,  instead  of</span><span>  wrangling  for  months  with  a  pros-</span><span>  pective  owner  as  to  whether  he  be</span><span>  allowed  a  few  feet  more  floor  space</span><span>  than  is  laid  down  in  the  regulation,</span><span>  should  be  conducting  the  closes*</span><span>  scrutiny  into  the  class  of  timber</span><span>  end  workmanship  that  is  being</span><span>  put  into  houses  that,  only  too  fre-</span><span>  quently,  are  eating  up  the  savings</span><span>  and  mortgaging  the  future  of  many</span><span>  of  those  who  will  become  the</span></p> <p><span>  owners.</span></p> <p><span>  Clearly  it  is  a  matter  for  the</span><span>  governments.  In  NSW  inspectors</span><span>  are  swooping  down  on  partly  con-</span><span>  structed  homes  and  examining  con-</span><span>  tracts,  with  the  result  in  some</span><span>  cases  of  hundreds  of  pounds  being</span><span>  refunded.  Unfortunately,  there  are</span><span>  many  ways  in  which  a  builder  of</span><span>  that  type,  if  he  has  a  mind  to,</span><span>  can  recoup  himself  for  the  loss</span><span>  before  the  place  is  finished.  The</span><span>  situation  calls  for  Some  more  dras-</span><span>  tic  reforjn,  but  how  it  is  to  com»</span><span>  about  is  not  at  all  clear.  Some-</span><span>  thing  of  the  same  nature  appar-</span><span>  ently  is  occurring  everywhere  and</span><span>  this  has  led  to  older  countries  giv-</span><span>  ing  attention  to  the  possibility  of</span><span>  bringing  about  revolutionary</span><span>  changes  in  home  building.</span></p> <p><span>  To  that  end  some  1700  British</span></p> <p><span>  architects  are  going  to  Sweden  to</span><span>  study  their  methods.  Becently  a</span><span>  world-wide  exhibition  of  home</span><span>  building  was  held  at  Brussels.  A</span><span>  remarkable  display  was  the  result,</span><span>  and  it  is  predicted  that  its  influence</span><span>  will  be  felt  in  all  countries  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  future.  Australia  presumably  was</span></p> <p><span>  not  represented,  or  we  have  heard</span><span>  nothing  of  it,  but  it  is  of  interest</span><span>  to  this  country  nevertheless,  and</span><span>  an  investigation  carried  out  by</span><span>  Commonwealth  Housing  authorities</span><span>  might  pay  dividends.

Indeed  it  was  often  a</span><span>  matter  for  regret  that  when  he</span><span>  had  greater  opportunities  than  any</span><span>  other  single  individual  in  the  State</span><span>  of  inculcating  ""a  sound  moral  order</span><span>  and  a  higher  conception  of  citi-</span><span>  zenship,""  he  used  his  opportunities,</span><span>  his  strength  and  his  intelligence  in</span><span>  leading  the  people  of  Queensland  in</span><span>  the  pursuit  of  those  material  things</span><span>  which  he  now  sadly  admits  have</span><span>  added  not  greatly  to  the  sum  total</span><span>  of  human  happiness,  though  it</span><span>  would  be  quite  incorrect  to  say</span><span>  that  they  have  added  nothing.</span></p> <p><span>  Much  will  have  happened  before</span><span>  the  1500  students  who  ássembled</span><span>  to  listen  to  the  Chancellor's  matric-</span><span>  ulation  address  emerge  to  face  the</span><span>  battle  of  life  and  put  to  the  test</span><span>  the  advice  he  has  tendered  fori</span><span>  their  guidance.  By  that  time  the</span><span>  future  of  Australia,  in  many  way*</span><span>  of  life,  will  have  been  shaped,</span><span>  possibly  in  directions  far  different</span><span>  from  what  is  contemplated  by  the</span><span>  students  at  this  hopeful  stage  of</span><span>  their  careers.  If  the  wise  precepts</span><span>  laid  down  by  Mr  Forgan  Smith  are</span><span>  to  be  assimilated  and  practised  to  a</span><span>  degree  that  will  prove  of  real  ser-</span><span>  vice  to  the  Commonwealth,  they</span><span>  will  require  to  be  addressed  to  a</span><span>  wider  audience  and  to  be  acted  on</span><span>  more  promptly  than  will  be  pos-</span><span>  sible  in  the  case  of  this  student</span><span>  body.</span></p> <p><span>  This  is  the  doctrine  that  should</span></p> <p><span>  be  inculcated  by  the  political  end</span><span>  industrial  leaders  of  today,  instead</span><span>  of  their  present  preachings  that</span><span>  standards  of  living  can  be  raised</span><span>  and  prosperity  and  contentment</span><span>  achieved  without  work,  that  more</span><span>  leisure  is  of  greater  importance</span><span>  than  adequate  food,  clothing  and</span><span>  shelter,  that  the  safety  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  nation  can  be  assured.  without</span></p> <p><span>  imposing  any  obligation  on  its</span><span>  citizens  for  its  defence.

Another  year's</span><span>  grace  wa6  given  to  laggards  who</span><span>  might  be  admitted  in  accordance</span><span>  with  specific  rules,  yet  Australia</span><span>  over-stepped  by  two  months  even</span><span>  the  year  of  grace  and  now,  a  unit</span><span>  representing  less  than  2i  per  cent</span><span>  of  the  total  quotae,  essays  to  dic-</span><span>  tate  to  the  34  nations  the  terms</span><span>  on  which  she  will  accept  member-</span><span>  ship!  It  is  the  usual  face-saving</span><span>  bluster  that  passes  in  Australia</span><span>  for  sturdy  independence,  and  at</span><span>  the  council  of  nations  for  what  it</span><span>  really  is.</span></p> <p><span>  For  fighting  after  the  war  is</span><span>  over  the  Canberra  gentry  will  go</span><span>  down  in  history  as  the  world's</span><span>  champions.  No  other  civilised  coun-</span><span>  try  is  maintaining  in  peace  a  rate</span><span>  of  taxation  that  per  head  of  popu-</span><span>  lation  is  higher  than  in  the  worst</span><span>  years  of  war.  But  it  was  different</span><span>  during  the  war  when  every  other</span><span>  country  was  bending  its  every</span><span>  energy  to  play  their  part  in  the</span><span>  grim  struggle,  Canberra  playboys</span><span>  quailed  before  imposing  the  cost  of</span><span>  war  upon  a  home  community  that</span><span>  was  being  glutted  with  money  it</span><span>  could  not  spend.  To  the  end  v  of</span><span>  June,  1945,  Australia  had  spent</span><span>  only  £292.3  per  head  of  population</span><span>  and  of^  that  only  27-46  per  cent</span><span>  came  from  the  people  in  direct  tax-</span><span>  ation.  Another  36.71  per  cent  of  it</span><span>  came  from  loans  to  which  the  stal-</span><span>  warts  at  Canberra  could  not  induce</span><span>  their  worker  friends  to  subscribe</span><span>  Having  regard  to  the  ends  to  which</span><span>  those  Labour  stalwarts  had  gone</span><span>  over  the  years  to  teach  their</span><span>  worker  friends  that  to  subscribe  to</span><span>  loans  was  the  peculiar  prerogative</span><span>  of  the  ""boss,""  the  result  is  not</span><span>  surprising.  The  purely  materialistic</span><span>  teachings  of  upwards  of  half  a</span><span>  century  cannot  he  wiped  out  be-</span><span>  cause  it  pays  Labour  prophets</span><span>  much  better  now  to  preach  another</span><span>  doctrine.  In  the  same  time  Canada</span></p> <p><span>  spent  £479  per  head  of  population</span><span>  of  which  45.38  per  cent  came  from</span><span>  the  people  in  direct  taxation  and</span><span>  another  44.60  per  cent  in  loans.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  with  this  tawdry  drop-sheet</span><span>  as  background  for  their  war  antics</span><span>  that  Canberra  showmen  are  now</span><span>  posing  as  heroes  in  ""the  bloodiest</span><span>  war  in  history,""  and  by  BO  doing</span><span>  delude  none  outside  of  Australia</span><span>  but  themselves.  It  is  against  this</span><span>  also  that  Chifleyites  announce  a</span><span>  ""gift""  to  Britain  of  £25,000,000,</span><span>  presumably  to  buy  food  in  countries</span><span>  where  ships  are  not  held  up  by  a</span><span>  noisy  minority  of  disloyalists  who</span><span>  lose  their  deposits  wheu  they  face</span><span>  an  election,  it  being  no  use  trying</span><span>  to  spend  it  in  Australia  where  cargo</span><span>  handlings  are  down  about  50  per</span><span>  cent  per  gang-hour.  In  terms  of</span><span>  food,  a  fleet  of  40  or  50  ships  idling</span><span>  in  Australian  ports  can  soon  eat  up</span><span>  £-25,000,000,  and  repercussions  of</span><span>  this  interpretation  of  the  Aus-</span><span>  tralian  Government's  sentiment  to-</span><span>  wards  starving  Europe  and  hungry</span><span>  Britain  are  shown  in  rotting  food</span><span>  supplies  and  a  consequent  check  to</span><span>  production.  Having  regard  to  the</span><span>  experience  of  the  ships  of  our  Dutch</span><span>  allies,  the  man  who  tries  to  spend</span><span>  in  Australia  £23,000,000  on  food</span><span>  for  Britain  might  consider  himself</span><span>  lucky  to  reach  home  safely'  with</span><span>  the  platter.</span></p> <p><span>  As  a  comparison  of  generosity</span><span>  Labour  at  Canberra  ""  shows  up</span><span>  dingily  against  the  Oanadian  yard-</span><span>  stick.  When  war  broke  out  Canada</span><span>  paid  up  in  advance  of  maturity  all</span><span>  her  London  debts  amounting  to</span><span>  £460,000,000,  and  also  repatrinted</span><span>  all  Canadian  bonds-  £242,400,000</span><span>  of  them-held  in  Britain.  Her  ster-</span></p> <p><span>  ling  balances  amounting  to  £ol7,</span><span>  100,000  were  turned  into  an  inter-</span><span>  est-free  loan,  and  ehe  made  an  out-</span><span>  right  gift  to  Britain  of  £203,000,</span><span>  000.  Labour-led  Australia  did  none</span><span>  of  these  things  nor,  on  the  other</span><span>  hand,  did  she  pay  her  debts  ""n</span><span>  curred  to  feed  the  first  AIF  during</span><span>  the  first  World  War.  That  debt</span><span>  amounts  to  £72,720,000  and  is</span><span>  still  owing.  Even  worse,  neither  in-</span><span>  terest  nor  redemption-  £A3,2S0,</span><span>  OOO  per  annum-has  been  paid  on</span><span>  this  since  1932.

It  ia  the  usual</span><span>  thing  for  a  Premier  sooner  or  later</span><span>  to  make  way  for  his  deputy,  and</span><span>  the  middle  term  of  a  Parliament  is</span><span>  considered  a  favourable  moment  to</span><span>  make  the  change.

If  the  alterna-</span><span>  tive  is  Mr  Foley,  Mr  Bruce  or  Mr</span><span>  Gair  the  universal  wish  will  be</span><span>  that  Mr  Hanlon  remains  at  the</span><span>  head  of  the  Government.</span></p> <p><span>  Whoever  comprises  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  they  will  have  grave  enough</span><span>  problems  to  grapple  with  in  the</span><span>  ensuing  three  years.

Today  there  is  *  stronger  argu-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  against  -the  eagerness  of</span><span>  young  people  to  rush  into  dead-</span><span>  end  occupations  than  either  the</span><span>  Speech  Day  oratory  or  the  obvi-</span><span>  ous  lack  of  ""future  which  these</span><span>  jobs  hold.  The  very  labour</span><span>  shortage  which  is  leading  to  the</span><span>  plenitude  of  jobs  and  high  wages</span><span>  is  hastening  tile  day  when  less</span><span>  and  less  unskilled  labour  will  be</span><span>  employed.  We  have  not  to  go</span><span>  beyond  our  own  city  for  concrete</span><span>  examples.

Coal  production  by</span><span>  mechanical  means  is  considered  to</span><span>  threaten  the  employment  of  coal</span><span>  hewers  to  such  an  extent  that</span><span>  every  means,  from  pressure  on</span><span>  governments  to  a  nation  wide</span><span>  strike,  are  being  resorted,  to  to  pre-</span><span>  vent  its  introduction.  The  man-</span><span>  ager  of  the  State  Cotton  Board</span><span>  has  just  returned  from  overseas</span><span>  to  report  the  successful  operation</span><span>  of  machines  that  will  do  the</span><span>  labour  of  500  field  workers.  Addi-</span></p> <p><span>  tionally,  slot  machines  are  every</span><span>  day  reaching  a  perfection  that</span><span>  dispense  with  the  services  of</span><span>  more  and  more  shop  salesmen  and</span></p> <p><span>  women.</span></p> <p><span>  Nor  is  there  a  wide  open  door</span><span>  of  escape  in  higher  education</span><span>  leading  to  the  professions.

The</span><span>  answer  to  that  must  be  a  decided</span><span>  No.  In  a  country  like  Australia</span><span>  there  should  be  no  such  thing  as</span><span>  a  really  dead-end  job  for  a  person</span><span>  of  industry  and  enterprise^  and</span></p> <p><span>  we  should  also  be  able  to  absorb</span></p> <p><span>  the  output  of  the  higher  educa</span><span>  tional  institutions.  But  that  can</span><span>  be  achieved  only  by  an  expanding</span><span>  economy  capable  of  sustaining  a</span><span>  larger  population.

JUNE  4,  1947.</span></p> <p><span>  STATE  OWNERSHIP</span></p> <p><span>  lu  the  light  of  recent  events</span><span>  there  appears  to  he  good  grounds</span><span>  for  questioning  the  Commonwealth</span><span>  Government's  sincerity  concerning</span><span>  its  policy  of  nationalisation  of</span><span>  industries.  There  is  a  growing</span><span>  conviction  that  it  is  all  for  the</span><span>  nationalisation  of  easyrto-run</span></p> <p><span>  going  concerns,  but  shies  off  any-</span><span>  thing  involving  a  pioneering  risk,</span><span>  and'is  ready  to  leave  to  the  hated</span><span>  Capitalist  'all  undertakings  that,</span><span>  are  liable  to  be  beset  by  financial  j</span><span>  or  labour  problems.  j</span></p> <p><span>  Evidence  on  these  points  is  pro-j</span><span>  vided'  by  the  current  activities  in</span><span>  respect  of  commercial  aviation  and</span></p> <p><span>  coal  mining,  Notwithstanding  a  ¡</span><span>  High  Court  decision  which  checked  J</span><span>  the  initial  move  to  take  over  the  j</span><span>  companies  that  had  pioneered</span><span>  commercial  aviation  in  Australia,</span><span>  and  without  whose  capital  and  en-</span><span>  terprise  there  would  have  been</span></p> <p><span>  no  airlines  to  take  over,  the  Gov-</span></p> <p><span>  ernment  ha»  applied  itself  assidu-</span></p> <p><span>  ously  to  achieving  its  purpose  by</span><span>  other  means.  Lately  negotiations</span><span>  for  the  purchase  of  the  .  shares</span><span>  held  by  Quantas  in  the  overseas</span></p> <p><span>  service  were  reported,  and  at-  the  j</span><span>  moment  considerable  pressure  is</span></p> <p><span>  being  exerted  by  the  Common-  I</span></p> <p><span>  wealth  airline  to  invade  the  intra-</span><span>  state  field.  The  ultimate  object</span><span>  is  manifest-by  fair  means  or</span><span>  otherwise  to.  force  private  opera-</span><span>  tors  out  .  of  commercial  aviation</span><span>  and  make  it  a  Government  monop</span></p> <p><span>  Why  this  desire  to  demonstrate</span><span>  the  blessings  of  State  ownership</span><span>  in  commercial  aviation,  when</span><span>  there  are  so  many  other  activities</span><span>  touching.  the  lives  of  the  people</span><span>  much  more  closely  on  which  the</span><span>  experiment  could  be  carried  out?</span><span>  Is  it  because  airlines  are  a  new</span><span>  and  expanding  avenue  of  com-</span><span>  merce  with  a  profitable  future</span><span>  ahead?  More  pertinent  still,  is  it</span><span>  because  it  is  one  of  the  few  things</span><span>  unlikely  to  be  beset  by  labour</span></p> <p><span>  troubles  ?</span></p> <p><span>  These  questions  arise  from  the</span><span>  circumstance  that,  at  the  very</span></p> <p><span>  time  when  the  Government  is</span><span>  straining  every  effort  to  extend  its</span><span>  hold  on  airlines,  it  has  quietly</span><span>  handed  back  to  the  owners  Coal-</span><span>  cliff  coal  mine,*  in  New  South</span><span>  Wales.  Coalcliff  was  to  be  the</span><span>  shining  example  of  how  the  Fed-</span><span>  eral  Government  could  conduct</span><span>  coal  mining,  presumably  by  grant-</span><span>  ing  to  the  miners  every  thing  they</span><span>  could  desire.  Strange  to  say,  or</span><span>  rather,  needless  to  state,  there</span><span>  was  no  loud  sounding  of  trumpets</span><span>  when  the  mine  wast  handed  back</span><span>  to  its  former  owners.  Indeed  the</span><span>  bare  fact  that  the  transfer  was</span><span>  made  had  to  be  drawn  from  the</span><span>  Prime  Minister,  like  the  extrac-</span><span>  tion  of  an  eye  tooth,  at  question</span><span>  hour  in  the  Federal  Parliiftnent.</span></p> <p><span>  In  reply  to  Mr  Beale,  M.P.7  who</span><span>  asked  whether  the  colliery  ""had</span><span>  been  handed  back  in  Maren  after</span><span>  losing  £85,000  whilst  under  Gov-</span><span>  ernment  control,  Mr  Chifley  ad-</span><span>  mitted  that  the  Government  had</span><span>  handed  Coalcliff  back  after  run-</span><span>  ning  it  at  a  loss  during  the  war,</span><span>  but  he  was  unable  to  say  what</span><span>  was  the  exact  loss.  However,.  val-</span><span>  uable  experiments  in  the  use  of</span><span>  water  for  elimination  of  dust</span><span>  had  been  conducted  there.</span></p> <p><span>  This  is  a  typical  Chifley  answer.</span><span>  Imagine  a  Prime  Minister</span><span>  Treasurer  not  ascertaining  the</span></p> <p><span>  extent  of  the  deficit  before  the</span><span>  momentous  decision  was  reached</span><span>  to  cut  the  loss  and  abandon  the</span><span>  experiment.  If  the  balance  had</span><span>  been  the  other  way  he  would  have</span><span>  had  the  figures  at  his  fingers'  ends,</span><span>  and  proclaimed  them  from  the</span><span>  housetops.  And  what  a  ""foot-</span><span>  ling""  justification  to  put  forward</span><span>  about  ""the  valuable  experiments</span><span>  in  the  use  of  water  for  the  elim-</span><span>  ination  of  dust  in  mines.""  The</span><span>  (.um  of  £85,000  is  a  lot  to  spend</span><span>  j  in  experiments  in  one  mine,  and</span><span>  whatever  they  revealed  it  does</span><span>  net  seem  to  have  gone  very  far</span><span>  to  eliminating  dust  in  mines</span><span>  in  a  general  way,  since  that  con-</span><span>  tinues  to  be  one  of  the  staple  ex-</span><span>  cuses  for  a  hold-up,  when  there  is</span><span>  nothing  else  in  sight.</span></p> <p><span>  Before  all  others  the  coaL  indusr</span><span>  try  was  one  in  which  the  Labour</span><span>  .Government  could  best  have</span></p> <p><span>  (proved  to  the  people  of  Australia</span></p> <p><span>  what  merit  there  resided  in  its</span><span>  nationalisation  policy,  as  well  as</span><span>  the  capacity  of  the  State  to  con-</span><span>  duct  industrial  and  commercial</span><span>  enterprises.

This  reef  was</span><span>  discovered  on  November  10,  1788,</span><span>  by  the  store  ship  Golden  Grove</span><span>  and  named  by  her  commander  after</span><span>  the  then  Comptroller  of  the  Navy.</span><span>  Wary  mariners  at  once  gave  the</span><span>  place  a  wide  berth,  only  to  find</span><span>  their  ships  either  ashore  or  in</span><span>  danger  of  being  dashed  ashore  on</span></p> <p><span>  a  terrifying  reef  that  seemed  to</span><span>  drift  into  their  path.  No  matter</span><span>  what  they  did  the  spouting  reef</span><span>  bobbed  up  under  their  bows,  and</span><span>  after  clearing  it  they  were  again</span><span>  finding  themselves  in  imminent</span><span>  danger,  of  once  more  running  on</span></p> <p><span>  it.  It  was  more  than  30  years  ere</span></p> <p><span>  it  was  discovered,  that  there  are</span></p> <p><span>  two  reefs,  Middleton  and  Eliza-</span><span>  beth,  separated  from  all  other  reefs</span><span>  by  at  least  1000  miles  and  from</span><span>  each  other  by  only  28  miles.</span></p> <p><span>  A  scout  plane  would  soon  have</span><span>  cleared  up  the  misunderstanding</span><span>  caused  by  the  error  in  longitude</span><span>  which  caused  Hovell  and  Hume</span><span>  to  believe  on  December  16,  1824,</span><span>  that  they  were  camped  on  the</span><span>  shores  of  Westernport,  whereas</span><span>  they  were  in  fact  camped  on  the</span><span>  beach  near  Bird  Rock  Point,  Gee-</span><span>  long.  Their  glowing  accounts  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  pastoral  land  through  which</span><span>  they  passed  led  to  a  settlement</span></p> <p><span>  being  established  at  Westernport</span><span>  in  November,  1826,  the  members</span><span>  of  which  eked  out  a  wretched  exist-</span><span>  ence  until  the  settlement,  based  on</span><span>  error,  was  abandoned  in  January,</span><span>  1828.  But  it  was  not  until  Henty</span><span>  landed  on  Hobsons  Bay  in  No-</span><span>  vember,  1834--or  ten  years  after</span></p> <p><span>  the  historic  error--that  the  reason</span><span>  for  the  difference  between  the</span></p> <p><span>  Hovell-Hume  description  of  Gee-</span><span>  long  country,  and  that  of  luckless</span><span>  settlers  at  Westernport  of  their</span><span>  surroundings,  became  apparent.</span><span>  Yet  a  plane  would  have  cleared</span><span>  up  the  mystery  in  half  an  hour,</span></p> <p><span>  Near  the  western  corner  of  the</span><span>  Northern  Territory  appear  the</span></p> <p><span>  names  Queen's  Channel  and  Vic-</span></p> <p><span>  toria  River,  which  were  bestowed</span><span>  by  Wickham  of  HMS  Beagle  in</span><span>  December,  1839,  in  honour  of  a</span><span>  young  girl  who  had  just  ascended</span><span>  the  throne  of  England.  The  river</span><span>  and  estuary  were  but  newly</span><span>  discovered,  and  were  of  such  noble</span><span>  proportions  as  to  bring  honour  to</span><span>  the  christening.  This  was  accen-</span><span>  tuated  by  the  fact  that  the  Beagle</span><span>  negotiated  the  river  for  45  miles</span><span>  to  a  secure  berth  in  Holdfast</span><span>  Reach,  where  she  watered  liberally</span><span>  from  wells  on  the  western  shore.</span><span>  To  all  appearances  the  river  was</span><span>  boring  south-east  towards  its</span><span>  source  in  the  unexplored  heart  of</span><span>  the  continent.  What  is  more,  it</span><span>  added  up  with  a  story  brought</span><span>  back  to  Sydney  in  1831  by  an</span></p> <p><span>  escaped  convict  named  Clark--alias</span></p> <p><span>  The  Barber--who  had  sojourned</span><span>  for  some  years  among  the  inland</span><span>  blacks.  Among  his  peregrinations</span><span>  with  them  was  a  journey  down  the</span><span>  Kindur,  a  great  river  that  ran</span><span>  northwards  to  the  ocean,  and</span><span>  Surveyor-General  Thomas  Living-</span><span>  stone  Mitchell  set  out  in  1831  to</span><span>  test  the  story.  His  wanderings</span><span>  brought  him  to  a  river  which  he</span><span>  named  Kuraula,  now  the  Mac-</span><span>  Intyre,  at  that  part  of  its  course</span><span>  which  ran  north-west,  but  he</span><span>  found  on  following  it  that  it</span><span>  turned  and  joined  a  number  of</span><span>  other  ill-conditioned  rivers  to  run</span><span>  south  into  the  Barwon.  It  would</span><span>  have  saved  him  much  heart-</span><span>  burning  had  he  remembered  that</span><span>  lesson  15  years  later.</span></p> <p><span>  Many  things  occupied  Mitchell's</span><span>  time  in  the  ensuing  years,  but  the</span><span>  ""  Kindur  ""  river  story  persisted.</span><span>  His  southern  explorations  took  him</span><span>  to  Victoria  and  the  southern  border</span><span>  of  what  was  to  become  South  Aus-</span><span>  tralia,  but  by  1845  he  was  free</span><span>  to  solve  for  all  time  the  riddle  of</span><span>  Kindur,  to  which  Wickham's  dis-</span><span>  covery  of  the  Victoria  River  had</span><span>  given  such  support.  Moreover,</span><span>  popular  attention  was  directed</span><span>  strongly  to  the  matter  of  exploring</span><span>  central  and  northern  Australia.</span><span>  Mitchell  left  Boree  for  Bourke  on</span><span>  December  15,  1845,  two  days  before</span><span>  Leichhardt  arrived  at  Port  Essing-</span><span>  ton,  and  five  days  before  Sturt</span><span>  reached  Cawndilla--and  safety--</span><span>  after  his  tragically  gruelling  ex-</span><span>  periences  on  Cooper's  Creek.</span></p> <p><span>  On  first  coming  upon  the  Bely-</span><span>  ando  Mitchell  imagined  that  here</span><span>  at  last  was  the  elusive  Kindur,  but</span><span>  its  easterly  trend  led  him  to  de-</span><span>  duce--correctly--that  the  river</span><span>  discharged  into  the  Pacific.  Then</span><span>  on  September  15,  1846,  he  found</span><span>  after  passing  through  a  gap  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  hills  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""The  realisation  of  my  long-</span><span>  cherished  hopes,  an  interior  river</span><span>  falling  to  the  north-west  in  the</span><span>  heart  of  an  open  country  extending</span><span>  also  in  that  direction.

""  jrftt  «f^P*</span></p> <p><span>  of  devotion,  zeal  and  loyalty  I</span><span>  therefore  gave  to  this  river  the</span><span>  name  of  my  gracious  Sovereign</span><span>  Wueen  Victoria.""  A  very  small</span><span>  scout  plane  would  have  corrected</span><span>  his  belief  that  he  was  naming  the</span><span>  head,  where  Wickham  had  named</span><span>  the  mouth  of  the  same  river  seven</span><span>  years  earlier.

During  the</span><span>  economic  slump  we  had  depriva-</span><span>  tion  in  the  midst  of  plenty,  whilst</span><span>  today  there  exists  a  growing  state</span><span>  of  unemployment  in  the  face  of</span><span>  an  unprecedented  shortage  of  man-</span><span>  power  and  -  an  unsatisfied  demand</span><span>  for  the  products  of  the  land  and</span><span>  pf  eons  omer  goods  that  is  without</span><span>  parallel.  Just  to  add  to  the</span><span>  general  lunacy  pf  things  there  is</span><span>  an  insistent  demand  to  curtail</span><span>  hours  and  reduce  production  in  the</span><span>  few  industries  that  are  still</span><span>  functioning;  whilst  «very  second</span><span>  person  ..unemployed  want«  to  be  a</span><span>  starting-price  bookmaker,  a  Gov-</span></p> <p><span>  ernment  official  or  a  canvasser.</span></p> <p><span>  Nothing  could  be  more  illustra-</span><span>  tive  of  the  state  of  growing  un-</span><span>  employment  in  the  face  of  acute</span><span>  labour  shortage  than  the  tailoring</span><span>  trade  ia  Rockhampton,  cited  a</span><span>  few  days  ago-  .  Under  anything</span></p> <p><span>  approaching  normal  conditions</span></p> <p><span>  there  would  most  certainly  be  a</span><span>  shortage  of  operatives  in  the  tail-</span><span>  oring  trade,  since  tile  demand  for</span><span>  new  clothes  by'  the  male  populace</span><span>  is  great  indeed  and  they  do  not</span><span>  lack  the  means  of  purchase.  But</span><span>  local  tailoring  establishments  are</span><span>  reducing  to  a  minimum  their  al-</span><span>  ready  diminished  staffs,  and  some</span><span>  are  faced  with  closing  down  alto-</span><span>  gether  owing  to  tiie  volume  of</span><span>  business  being  insufficient  to  meit</span><span>  overhead.  The  chief  cause  is  a</span><span>  lack  of  materials.  And  this  is</span></p> <p><span>  happening  in  a  country  which  ia</span></p> <p><span>  the  main  .  source  of  the  world's</span><span>  supply  of  the  first  essential  to</span><span>  men's  clothing  seeds.  The  same</span><span>  thing  applies  to  practically  every-</span><span>  thing  else.  Hundreds  of  ex</span><span>  servicemen  are  being  trained  éo</span><span>  become  building  operatives,  yet1</span><span>  the  building  trade  is  hamstrung</span><span>  because  wharf  labourers  will  not  i</span><span>  move  cargoes  excepting  under  a  i</span><span>  working  hours  .schedule  that  is</span><span>  absolutely  incompatible  with  an</span><span>  efficient  shipping  service,  and  are  j</span><span>  rewarded  for  their  obduracy  with  i</span><span>  annual  holidays  and  special  pay-</span><span>  ment  for  doing  nothing  (it  ia</span></p> <p><span>  called  appearance  money).  i</span></p> <p><span>  Nor  are  these  the  only  disturb-.</span><span>  ing  features  of  the  post-war  em-</span><span>  ployment  position.  Based  upon</span><span>  the  optimistic  assurances  of  poli-</span><span>  ticians  and  bureaucrats  there  is  a</span><span>  more  or  less  comfortable  feeling</span><span>  that  the  post-war  training</span><span>  schemes  for  ex-servicemen  are  go-</span><span>  ing  along  swuimingly,  and  will</span><span>  eventually  produce  a  crop  of</span><span>  skilled  and  semi-skilled  workers</span><span>  who  will  bave  a  big  faflnni»^  jn</span><span>  improving  the  production  position</span><span>  in  the  not-far  distant  future.

Taking  a  line  from  Brita«</span><span>  whose  main  trouble  is  that  si</span><span>  must  import  goods  if  6he  is  to  liyi</span><span>  the  miracle  men  at  Canberra  app!</span><span>  to  Australia,  which  must  export  :</span><span>  exist,  the  fiame  remedies  for  weat!</span><span>  ering  the  economic  storm  as  thos</span><span>  used  by  harassed  Britain.  .Fi</span><span>  from  being  troubled  at  prospect</span><span>  for  footing  the  bill  for  import</span><span>  Australia  had  an  export  balam</span><span>  over  imports  for  the  21  months  1</span><span>  thc  end  of  June  last  of  £120,370</span><span>  OOO,  and  even  allowing  for  import</span><span>  being  reckoned  in  sterling  and  es</span><span>  ports  in  Australian  currency,  thi</span><span>  is  a  mighty  fine  credit  balan»</span><span>  That  is  to  say,  over  that  perio</span><span>  Australia  was  a  creditor  natioi</span><span>  She  had  commodities  that  othc</span><span>  countries  wanted,  and  were  prc</span><span>  pared  to  buy,  that  much  in  excès</span><span>  of  what  we  were  able  to  get  froi</span><span>  them.  Yet  the  remedy  devised  b</span><span>  the  Canberra  Brains  Trust  is  t</span><span>  shut  down  on  imports,  which  i</span><span>  another  way  of  saying  that  w</span><span>  must  ateo  shut  down  on  export</span><span>  to  any  country  which  has  not  th</span><span>  gold  to  pay  for  such  excess  goodi</span><span>  But  particularly  must  we  refraii</span><span>  from  taking  goods  from  USA.  I</span></p> <p><span>  seems  as  if  Canberra  is  detei</span></p> <p><span>  mined  that,  at  all  costs,  thi</span><span>  country  shall  have  its  depression.</span></p> <p><span>  A  week  ago  it  was  announce«</span><span>  that  the  faint  glimmerings  of  ¡</span><span>  live-stock  export  trade  from  th</span><span>  Northern  Territory  to  the  Philip</span><span>  pines  was  to  be  banned.  Know</span><span>  ledge  of  this  promised  trad</span><span>  came  only  with  the  intimatioi</span><span>  that  the  chances  were  heavil;</span><span>  in  favour  of  it  being  banned,  &</span><span>  that  Mr  Chifley  might  continue  ii</span><span>  bis  enjoyment  of  the  misery  tha;</span><span>  is  tbe  first-fruit  of  depression</span><span>  This  live  cattle  trade  was  initiate!</span><span>  in  1921  by  Vestey's-accurst  o</span><span>  Labour-and  shipments  went  fron</span><span>  both  Darwin  and  Wyndham  unti</span><span>  about  1930,  when  the  Governmen</span><span>  of  the  Philippine  Islands  banned  i</span><span>  so  as  to  turn  to  Indo-China,  wheri</span><span>  there  were  prospects  of  two-wa]</span><span>  trade.  Fat  cattle  were  not  neede&lt;</span><span>  for  this  trade,  ""oe  the  buyers  pre</span><span>  ferred  big  bullocks  in  store  condi</span><span>  tion,*'  and  while  it  operated  i</span><span>  total  of  55,000  head  were  shipped</span><span>  In  the  words  of  the  Payne  repor</span><span>  of  1937:  ""Such  a  trade,  even  if  nol</span><span>  very  remunerative,  would  enabli</span><span>  local  herds  to  be  cleaned  up,  ant</span><span>  lift  the  industry  in  tbe  Darwin  dis-</span><span>  trict  from  its  present  deplorabli</span><span>  state.""  Another  virtue  is  that  to</span><span>  day  it  would  produce  dollar  ex</span><span>  change  that,  we  are  told  in  and  oui</span><span>  of  season,  is  in  desperate  short</span><span>  supply.</span></p> <p><span>  What  the  people  of  Australia  an</span><span>  entitled  to  ask  is:  if  the  crux  Oj</span><span>  the  question  today  is  dollar  short</span><span>  age,  why  in  the  name  of  all  thai</span><span>  hag-a  semblance  of  sanity,  cannol</span><span>  we  trade  with  the  only  countrj</span><span>  which  is  able  to  supply  them?  T&lt;</span><span>  what  extent  is  Britain's  case  pre-</span><span>  judiced  through  Australia  trading</span><span>  with  USA  at  least  on  the  level  ol</span></p> <p><span>  [our  exports  to  her?  Especially  is</span></p> <p><span>  this  the  more  perplexing  in  view  oi</span><span>  the  inability  of  Britain  to  supply</span><span>  all  our  needs.  Shipping  Northern</span><span>  Territory  live  cattle  to  the  Philip-</span><span>  pines  will  not  prejudice  'Britain's</span><span>  food  supply,  as  these  cattle  are  fax</span><span>  removed  from  a  meatworks  and  in</span><span>  any  case  are  below  chiller  stand-</span><span>  ard.  The  surest  way  to  pull  down</span><span>  Britain  is  to  pull  down  her  domin-</span><span>  ions,  and  the  surest  way  to  go</span><span>  about  that  is.  to  apply  the  sam«</span><span>  remedy  in  an  exporting,  as  in  an</span><span>  importing,  country.  The  surest  way</span><span>  to  aid  Britain  is  to  ensure  that  aa</span><span>  many  producing  countries  as  pos-</span><span>  sible  keep  on  their  feet,  and  the</span><span>  surest  way  to  that  end  is  to  main-</span><span>  tain  a  high  level  of  production.  To</span><span>  put  everyone  in  sight  on  short</span><span>  rations  is  not  going  to  help  Brit-</span><span>  ain,  and  to  ban  every  prospect  of</span><span>  trade  between  Australia  and  other</span><span>  nations  is  not  going  to  help  any-</span><span>  one.  Taking  just  on  one-third  of</span><span>  our  total  wool  exports  over  21</span><span>  months  to  the  end  of  March  last,</span><span>  USA  is  second  only  to  Britain  a«</span><span>  a  consumer  of  Australian  wool,  and</span><span>  that  despite  all  the  recent  hubub</span><span>  over  the  new  import  duty.  There</span><span>  are  many  imports  from  USA  that</span><span>  are  not  important  to  our  Austral-</span><span>  ian  economy;  but  there  are  on  the</span><span>  other  hand  many  types  of  machin-</span><span>  ery  that  are  practically  impera-</span><span>  tive  to  our  further  development.</span></p> <p><span>  Meanwhile,  if  aid  to  Britain  is</span><span>  not  to  degenerate  into  mere  lip</span><span>  service,  that  is  in  such  prolific</span><span>  supply  at  Canberra,  Australia</span><span>  might  aid  the  dollar  position  in</span><span>  Britain  by  paying  her  long  out</span><span>  standing  debts,  and  then  by  ship-</span><span>  ments  of  gift  food.  One  of  Brit</span></p> <p><span>  ain's  major  difficulties  is  that  if</span><span>  she  buys  from  her  Dominions  she</span><span>  must  also  buy  in  like  amount</span><span>  from  USA,  which  means  that  the</span><span>  more  Dominion  food  she  imports</span><span>  the  worse-off  she  becomes.  But</span><span>  that  does  not  apply  if  tho  Domin.</span><span>  ions  present  her  with  food.  It  will</span><span>  be  a  new  experience  for  Canberra</span><span>  -the  £25,000,000  gift  was  merely</span><span>  a  book  entry,  as  Britain  is  not.</span><span>  short  of  sterling-but  an  excursion</span><span>  into  generosity  will  not  come  amis^</span><span>  up  that  way.  It  is  not  likely  to</span><span>  bte  forgotten  that,  with  Minister-</span><span>  ial  approval,  the  food  parcels  to</span><span>  Britain  movement  met  with  strong</span><span>  official  opposition,  and  that  prob-</span><span>  ably  accounts  for  much  of  the</span><span>  popular  aC^^^teKgrds  the  plight</span></p> ",Article,1947-09-09,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1947.

In  February  lasi</span><span>  the  rainmaking  scientists  of  the</span><span>  CSD3  conducted,à  series  of  .flights</span><span>  over  Unland  ""-areas  in  New  Soutl</span><span>  Wales,-  dufing  which  they  dropped</span><span>  on  the  cloud  .  tops  -  dry  ice  (solid</span><span>  carbon  dipxide  at  minus  80  degrees</span><span>  centigrade).</span></p> <p><span>  These  experiments  showed  that</span><span>  man  can  Influence  the  weather,</span><span>  but  only  under  favourable  condi-</span><span>  tions.  It  was  found  that  massive</span><span>  cumulative  i  cloud  ^was  necessary.</span><span>  Cloud  is  a  mass  ""  of  tiny  '  water</span><span>  particles  and  when  the  dry  ice  was</span><span>  dropped;  it  affected  the  cloud  in</span><span>  two  ways.  First  it  created,  as  it</span><span>  fell,  a  channel  of  cool  air  in  which</span><span>  the  tiny  water  drops  were  trans-</span><span>  formed  jnto  ice  crystals.  These</span><span>  grew  '  at  the  expense  of  others  in</span><span>  the  vicinity  until  they  were  heavy</span><span>  enough  to  fall  as  rain.  Secondly</span><span>  the  dry  ice  had.  an  explosive  effect</span><span>  on  the  cloud  top.  It  was  boosted</span><span>  into  an  anvil  like  top  in  which</span><span>  the  water  drops  froze  of  their  own</span><span>  accord  &lt;and  the  rain  processes  were</span><span>  repeated.  Of  eight  occasions  on</span><span>  which  dry  ice  was  dropped  radar</span></p> <p><span>  observations  indicated  that  rain</span><span>  formed  inside  the  cloud-  on  six</span><span>  occasions  and  on  four  of  these  rain</span><span>  was  seen  to  reach  the  ground.  One</span><span>  test  was  doubtful  and  a  single</span><span>  negative  result  was  obtained.</span></p> <p><span>  .  The  most  spectacular  success</span><span>  was  a  rainstorm  covering  more</span><span>  than  20  miles  -which  reached  the</span><span>  ground  when  aircraft  wer*  unable</span></p> <p><span>  to  discern  any  other  /rain:-within</span></p> <p><span>  '  100  miles  of  the  -infected  -  cloud.</span><span>  Whilst  the  scientists  regarded  this</span><span>  as  a  considerable,  achievement  the</span><span>  chief  Value  attached  to  the  success</span><span>  was'that  the  tests  indicated,  for</span><span>  the  first  time,  just-.how  far  they</span><span>  had;  to  go  before,  it  co^ld  ;be  toid</span><span>  whether  or  not  rainmaking  was  a</span><span>  practical  proposition.  They  admît</span><span>  that  it  is'  one  thing  ~  to  produce</span><span>  rain  -from  towering  cumnlous</span><span>  cloud,  but  what  if  ploud  of  this</span><span>  type  does  not  appear  over  drought</span><span>  stricken  areas  crying  out  for  rain?</span><span>  On  their  experiments  thus  far  the</span><span>  scientists  admit  that  they  cannot</span><span>  create  rain  out  of  a  cloudless  sky.</span><span>  It  can  be  produced  over  very  limi-</span><span>  ted  areas,  but  the  occasions  on</span><span>  witch  it  can  be  done  «yen  then  are</span><span>  jra^-rurriermore,  it  has  yet  to  be</span><span>  ascertained  ""  whether  or  not  the</span><span>  process,  is  economic,  ¡</span></p> <p><span>  The  dry  ice  method  was  only  the</span><span>  first  of  a  eecies  of  attacks  on-the</span><span>  cloud  structured  In  a.  fresh  series</span><span>  of  flights  about  to  be  undertaken</span><span>  hundreds  of  gallons  of  liquid</span><span>  preparation  will  be  dropped.  This</span><span>  liquid  has  a  strong  attraction  for</span><span>  water.  When  sprayed  into  the</span><span>  (cloud  top  tiny  water  particles  too</span><span>  light  to  fall  as  rain  are  attracted</span><span>  to  it,  coagulated  into  big  drops</span><span>  and;fall  as  rajiK  At  least,  that  is</span><span>  what  happens  theoretically.  What</span><span>  the  CS  IR  wants  to  discover  is</span><span>  ^whether  this  method  will  produce</span><span>  rain-  from  more  types  of  clpud</span><span>  than  .will  dry.  ice.

First,  little</span><span>  is  known  about  what  goes  on  inside</span><span>  a  cloud  in  relation  to  turbulence,</span><span>  temperature  and  humidity'.  Also</span><span>  there  are  no  records  to  show  what</span><span>  type  of  cloud,  if  any,  can  be</span><span>  expected  at  any  .given  time  over</span><span>  drought  threatened  areas  iii  Aus-</span><span>  tralia.  All  these  problems  are</span><span>  involved  in  the  .experiments  and</span><span>  give  some  idea  of  -the  magnitude  of</span><span>  the  task  that  has  been  undertaken.</span></p> <p><span>  Yet  none  will'contend  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  experiments  .are  not  worth,  while</span><span>  to.  make.  Indeed,  it  would  not  be*</span><span>  difficult  to  argue  that  the  rain-</span><span>  making  experiments  of  the  CS£R</span><span>  are  of  far  greater  value  tha&lt;i  the</span><span>  rocket  range  tests  also  to  be  con-</span><span>  ducted  in  Australia  almost  at  the</span><span>  identical  -  time.

It  will</span><span>  be  a  duel  to  the  death,  and  the</span><span>  winner  will  become  leader  of  the</span><span>  Government.  Unlike  the  1931  split</span><span>  When  there  waa  a  mere  shadow  of</span><span>  »  majority,  the  Chifley  Govern-</span><span>  ment  commands  such  a  following</span><span>  that  a  major  fight  such  sm  this</span><span>  can  he  waged  within  the  party</span><span>  without  involving  ""  the  possibility</span><span>  of  Messrs  Menzies  and  Fadden</span><span>  marching  through  the  breach  to</span><span>  the  Ministerial  Benches.  Ward  is</span><span>  a  forceful  fighter  who  will  have</span><span>  the  powerful  support  of  Mr  J.  T.</span><span>  Lang,  who  still  believes  that  it</span><span>  was  his  theory  and  not  the  Prem-</span><span>  iers'  Plan  which  pulled  Australis</span></p> <p><span>  out  of  the  mud  at  the  last  de-</span><span>  pression.  What  he  is  not  so  ready</span><span>  to  admit  is  that  it  was  his</span><span>  theory  and  not  the  Premiers'  Plan</span><span>  that  caused  the  Government  Sav-</span><span>  ings  Bank  to  close  its  doors.  Bot</span><span>  both  Lang  and  Ward  are  well</span><span>  primed  with  horror  stories  of</span><span>  ""Wall  Street  domination""  and  the</span><span>  fell  purpose  of  the  Bank  of  Eng-</span></p> <p><span>  land  to  ""direct  a  reduction  in  the</span><span>  Australian  standard  of  living.""</span><span>  Laug  warns  us  that  Australia  will</span><span>  have  to  ""find  £150  million  as  our</span><span>  quota.""  What  he  did  not  state</span><span>  was  that  only  20  per  cent  of  that</span><span>  quota  or  £80  million,  would  be</span><span>  called  up  for  direct  loan  opera-</span><span>  tions,  and  of  thal  only  2  per  cent</span></p> <p><span>  of  £0.6  million  would  need  to  be</span><span>  in  gold  or  USA  dollars.  The  re-</span><span>  maining  80  per  cent  or  £120  mil-</span><span>  lion  would  be  retained  in  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  as  a  reserve  against  losses,</span></p> <p><span>  just  as  any  other  kind  ol  Aus-</span><span>  tralian  business  would  hold  its  re-</span></p> <p><span>  serves  here.</span></p> <p><span>  Behind  Mr  Chifley  is  ranged  bia</span><span>  Brains  Trust  and  his  long  adher-</span><span>  ence  to  the  somewhat  shaky  fin-</span><span>  ancial  principles  of  the  Austral-</span><span>  ian  Labour  Party.  How  far  one</span><span>  of  these  supports  the  other  is  a</span><span>  moot  point,  but  there  seems</span><span>  little  doubt  but  that  Mr  Chifley</span><span>  would  be  a  much  more  command-</span><span>  ing  figure  did  he  stand  alone.

This  fact  has  been  seized</span></p> <p><span>  upon  by  Lang,  who  identifies  Cop-</span></p> <p><span>  land  as  ""co-author  of  the  Prem-</span><span>  iers'  Plan,  designer-in-chief  of</span><span>  Australia's  controlled  economy,""</span></p> <p><span>  and  he  sees  in  it  a  sinister  move</span><span>  at  the  behest  of  international</span><span>  ?financiers  to  tie  Australia  to  the</span><span>  wheel  of  the  Bretton  Woods</span><span>  agreement.

Th</span><span>  claim  Mr  Chifley  contested  hotly  &lt;</span><span>  the  hustings,  and  after  being  r</span><span>  turned  to  power  he  maintained  th¡</span><span>  view,  even  in  the  face  of  mountii</span><span>  evidence  to  the  «ratrary5  wii</span><span>  extraordinary  obstinancy.

It  is  that  consideration  is</span><span>  being  given  to  the  introduction  of</span><span>  a  national  superannuation  scheme</span><span>  to  replace  the  present  pensions</span><span>  system  and  ali  public  and  private</span><span>  schemes.

As  Mr  McKell</span></p> <p><span>  moved  on  to  Canberra  to  occupy</span><span>  the  ehoes  lately  vacated  by  HRH</span><span>  the  Duke  of  Gloucester,  so  must</span><span>  someone  move  into  the  place</span><span>  whence  Mr  McKell  departed.  For</span><span>  the  past  few  days  high  priests  of</span><span>  Labour  have  gathered  in  small</span><span>  groups  and  ^qehispered  guiltily  their</span><span>  hopes  and  fears,  only  to  break</span><span>  away  and  form  up  into  other</span><span>  groups  obsessed  with  similar</span><span>  hopes  and  fears.  It.  is  ""a  time  of</span><span>  tense  waiting  and  ?  watching  for</span><span>  eigne  and  portents,  for  none  knows</span><span>  who  of  the  existing  Cabinet  is</span><span>  nursing  a  secret  determination  to</span><span>  become  a  candidate  if  the  omens</span><span>  and  portents  take  a  propitious</span><span>  tum.  Most  of  them  recall  that  after</span><span>  sitting  on  the  rail  during  a  hettie</span><span>  party  crisis  McKell  started  unex-</span><span>  pectedly  in  a  jostling*  field  of  hot</span><span>  favourites  and  rode  to  victory  on  a</span><span>  oommiasion  that  went  astray-or</span></p> <p><span>  so  it  Vas  claimed.</span></p> <p><span>  Much  «table  support  will  go  to</span><span>  Mr  H.  J.  Heffron,  Minister  for  Ed-</span><span>  ucation  and  Child  Welfare,  who  has</span><span>  represented  Botany  since  1930.  Al-</span><span>  though  born  at  Thames,  New  Zea-</span></p> <p><span>  land,  Heffron'-,  ancestry  goes  back,</span><span>  to  Londonderry,  limerick.  He  haa</span><span>  dropped  much  bf  the  fire  and  en-</span><span>  thusiasm  of  youth,  and  now  affects</span><span>  s  -  diplomatic,  suave  approach  to</span><span>  major  problems,  of  which  NSW</span></p> <p><span>  Labour  baa  abundance.  One  handi-</span></p> <p><span>  cap  is  that  stalwarts  who  have  to</span><span>  face  up  to  the  hurly-burly  of  poli-</span><span>  tical  strife  are  not  enamoured  of</span><span>  Heffron's  kid-glove  technique,  ana</span><span>  another.is  that  critical  campaign</span><span>  director»  are  unlikely  to  regard  him</span><span>  as  a  good-draw  card  for  the  on-</span><span>  coming  election,  which  promises  to</span><span>  be  tough.  His  association  with  the</span><span>  ""Hands  off  Russia""  slogan  is  not</span><span>  regarded  in  all  quarters  as  a  happy</span><span>  augury.  He  also  promised  a</span><span>  balance  sheet  of  party  funds,  that</span><span>  there  was  to  be  no  Inner  Temple</span><span>  in  the  Labour  movement,'  and  that</span><span>  all  main  issues  would  be  decided</span><span>  by  Caucus.  Opponents-are  asking</span></p> <p><span>  where  he  wa»  when  the  reform</span></p> <p><span>  policy  was  side-tracked,  and  they</span><span>  also  want  to  know  whether  be</span><span>  could  maka  a  worse  mess  of  admin-</span><span>  istering  the  .State-  than  he  has</span><span>  achieved  wHlF  educational  facilities</span><span>  which,  they  claim,  are  in  a  chaotic</span><span>  state.  '</span></p> <p><span>  Mr  J.  McGirr  is  alike  a  stable</span><span>  hope  and  despair.  A  pharmaceuti-</span><span>  cal  chemist,  he  has  spent  much</span></p> <p><span>  time  of  late  on  the  science  of  ap-</span></p> <p><span>  plied  chemistry,  which  has  imbued</span><span>  m  him  a  sense  of  detachment  from</span></p> <p><span>  the  more  dynamic  Labour  lights.</span><span>  They  fear  that  he  may  have  be-</span></p> <p><span>  come  bitten  with  Heffron's  reform</span><span>  bug,  in  which  case  there  is  not</span><span>  much  doubt  about  the  course  he</span><span>  would  steer-even  to  the  extent  of</span><span>  extinguishing  politically  -  some  of</span><span>  the  dynamic  lights.  To  talk  reform</span><span>  in  Boom  32  is  to  invite  Left-wing</span><span>  tommy-gun  reaction,  with  the  Com-</span><span>  munists  .passing  up  the  ammuni-</span><span>  tion,  An  even  more  serious  hurdle</span><span>  ia  the  fact  that  as  Minister  for</span><span>  Housing  since  1941,  McGirr  is  to</span><span>  become  tile'  scapegoat  for  all  the</span><span>  housing  scandals  that  have  flour-</span><span>  ished  under  the  Curtin-Chifley-Mc</span><span>  Kell  dynasties,  and  there  are  grave</span><span>  doubts  about  his  ability  to  retain</span><span>  Bankstown,  which  he  has  repre-</span><span>  sented  since  1&27.  A  premier  who</span><span>  started  out  with  that  ""swag*'  of</span><span>  unpopularity  would  be  the  worst</span><span>  possible  leader  into  an  election  fight</span><span>  that  appears  at  this  distance  as  if</span><span>  Ss  will  go  the  full  ten  rounds.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr  W.  P.  Dunn,  Minister  for</span><span>  Conservation  since  1944,  is  in  a</span><span>  different  category.  He  is  anex-ADJ</span><span>  men  and  grandson  of  k  a  Waterloo</span><span>  veteran,  though  neither  of  these  is</span><span>  likely  to  enhance  his  prospects</span><span>  among  Labeur  chieftains.  Bather</span><span>  axe  they  liable  to  discount  them,</span><span>  there  being  strong  views  on</span><span>  the  propriety  t  of  defending</span><span>  one's,  country,  and  since  the</span><span>  Curtin  Government  -  showmen  got</span><span>  ««listed  USA  men  ito  come</span><span>  along  and  do  the  defending  those</span></p> <p><span>  Views  have  become  settled  convic-</span><span>  tions.  But  Dunn  has  other  claims.</span><span>  He  was  a  teacher  with  farming  af-</span><span>  filiations',  and  is  the  spear-head  of</span><span>  Bight  Wing  Labour's  attempt  to</span><span>  consolidate  its  position  among</span><span>  primary  producers  under  the  insinu-</span><span>  ating  guise  of  the  ""Labour  Country</span><span>  Party.""-a  bright  thought  which</span><span>  does  not  appear  to  have  caught  on</span><span>  ttl  Queensland.  The  important</span><span>  point  is  that  with  the  central</span><span>  votes  locked  up  in  so  compact  a</span><span>  bloc  there  may  not  be  enough  of</span><span>  those  primaries  to  go  round,  so</span><span>  that  *the  Labour  white  hope  sf</span><span>  the  bush""  may  get  enough  Bight</span><span>  Wing  primaries  to  give  him  a</span><span>  standing  until  the  second  prefer-</span><span>  ences  start  to  fall  his  way.  It  is  a</span><span>  slender  lead  or  advantage  which  he</span><span>  shares  with  none*  other.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Deputy-Premier,  Mr  J.  M.</span><span>  Baddeley,  has  been  Chief  Secretary</span><span>  and  Minister  for  Mines  since  1911,</span><span>  and  with  the  probable  exception  of</span><span>  housing  there  is  no  portfolio  that</span><span>  has  been  so  charged  with  trouble</span><span>  over  the  past  five  years  than  that</span></p> <p><span>  of  mines.  To  elect  as  Premier  the</span><span>  scapegoat  of  all  coal  shortages  and</span><span>  their  associated  blackouts  and</span><span>  walking  to  work  and  reverting  to</span><span>  open-fire  cooking  would  be  to  in-</span><span>  vite  disaster  at  the  election  in  May</span><span>  next,  and  the  diplomats  of  Boom</span></p> <p><span>  32  are  not  such  novices.

Thc</span><span>  promising  was  easy,  but  fulfil-</span><span>  ment  without  power  to  raise  th«</span><span>  necessary  funds  is  quite  anothei</span><span>  matter.

These  charges  hi</span><span>  everybody  alike,  and  no  Laboui</span><span>  Government  likes  that  kind  o</span><span>  taxation,  so  there  will  be  a  strong</span><span>  bid  to  wrest  from  Comrade  Chifley</span><span>  the  power  to  tax  incomes,  througl</span><span>  which  there  is  greater  opportunity</span><span>  to  delude  people  that  it  is  thi</span><span>  other  chap  that  is  paying.

He  found  that</span><span>  lore  in  Lancashire,  which  is  why</span><span>  the  Free  Trade  Hall,  Manchester,</span><span>  became  the  traditional  home  of</span><span>  ono  of  the  most  remarkable  de-</span></p> <p><span>  velopments  in  British  musical""</span><span>  history.</span></p> <p><span>  Born  in  1819,  Halie  began  his</span><span>  musical  career  at  the  mature  age</span><span>  of  aeren,  and  ten  years  later  ne</span><span>  vant  to  Paris  there  to  mingle  with</span><span>  such  giants  in  the  world  of  art  as</span><span>  Cherubim,  Chopin,  .Liszt,  de</span><span>  Müsset  and  George  Sand  's  but  the</span><span>  first  breath  of  the  French  revolu-</span><span>  tion  swept  him  across  the  channel</span><span>  to  Britain  and,  ultimately,  to  Man-</span><span>  chester.  Here  he  found-long  be-</span><span>  fore  the  songful  ebullition  of</span></p> <p><span>  Gracie  Fields-^that.  while  the  love</span><span>  of  music  was  ingrained  in  the</span><span>  people  of  Lancashire  it  was  prac-</span><span>  tically  uncultivated.  So  he  set  to</span><span>  work  ""to  wed  Lancashire  love  of</span><span>  miisic  with  German  musical  cul-</span><span>  turé,  -and  astonished  even  himself</span><span>  at  the  success  of  his  Lancastrian</span><span>  orchestra,  which  ^wrfonned  before</span><span>  the  late  Queen  Victoria  at  ""the</span><span>  Exhibition  of  Art  Treasures,  Man-</span><span>  chester,  in  May,  1857.</span></p> <p><span>  With  the  thunder  of  that  great</span><span>  success  ringing  in  his  ears.  Halie</span></p> <p><span>  launched  the  first  of  a  series  of</span><span>  orchestral  concerts  in  January,</span><span>  1858-and  came  out  of  it  with  an</span><span>  enhanced  reputation  and  a  profit</span><span>  of  half  a  crown,  as  à  warning  of</span><span>  how  strangely  fate  ""may  mingle</span><span>  bitter  with  sweet.  It  was  by  no</span><span>  means  his  last  of  such  experiences,</span><span>  but  Halle  pocketed  his  losses,  capi-</span><span>  talised  his  enhanced  prestige  and</span><span>  was  rewarded  when  three  Man-</span><span>  chester  ia  ns  came  forward  and</span></p> <p><span>  helped  him  with  the  losses.  This</span></p> <p><span>  led  to  the  formation  in  1889  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  present  Halle  Concerts  Society,</span><span>  membership  of  which  involves  an</span><span>  irrevocable  guarantee  of  £100  tu</span><span>  cover_  .losses,  with  which  backing</span></p> <p><span>  the  concerts',  have  continued</span></p> <p><span>  throughout  fortune  both  good  and</span><span>  bad.  Sir  Charles  Halle  died  ju</span><span>  1859.  but  left  as  monument  a  name</span><span>  that  took  fine  music  into  the  home</span><span>  of  the1  masses,  a  name  that  made</span><span>  immortal  his  ""bob  a  nob""  for</span><span>  practically  all  seats.  Great  figures</span><span>  -Richter,  Balling,  Beecham,  Harty</span><span>  and  Sargent-followed  Halle  in</span><span>  Ithat  order,  but  even  as  they  raised</span></p> <p><span>  to  new  heights  the  status  of  Jjthese</span></p> <p><span>  world-famoua*  orchestral  concerta,</span><span>  so  did  they  enhance  the  reputation</span><span>  of  the  man  who  .  gave  them  hi«</span><span>  genius  -and  his  name.</span></p> <p><span>  Then  came  World  War  II,  and</span><span>  in  like  measure  as  ,  recruitments</span><span>  left  deep  gaps  in  the  orchestra  se</span><span>  did  there  -  spring  up  all  over</span><span>  Britain  a  phenomenal  demand  for</span><span>  good  orchestral  music.  The  fragile</span><span>  second  violin  betook  herself  to  thc</span></p> <p><span>  cypher  office,  the  aesthetic  double</span><span>  bass  found  himself  among  the</span><span>  siege  artillery,  and  the  plump</span></p> <p><span>  flautist  blew  hails  of  lead  in  the</span><span>  mighty  aerial  orchestra  of  tho</span><span>  Battle  for  Britain;  Then  Goering's</span></p> <p><span>  emissaries  arrived  over  Manchester</span><span>  and  bombed  Free  Trade  Hall  out</span><span>  of  existence.  At  this  pass  it  seemed</span><span>  as  if  nothing  remained  to  the  Halie</span><span>  Society  but  to  play  its  own</span><span>  requiem,.  but  instead  it  flew  high</span><span>  and  invited  John  Barbirolli,  of</span><span>  the  New  York  Philharmonic  Sym-</span><span>  phony  orchestra,  to  come  to  Man-</span><span>  chester.  To  their  astonishment,  he</span><span>  agreed,  and  in  June,  1943,  he  ar-</span><span>  rived  and  at  once  applied  himself</span><span>  to  re-forming  the  3rd  oldest</span><span>  .orchestra""  in  the  world.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  unlikely  that  anybody  ex-</span><span>  pected  miracles,  but  that  is  what</span><span>  they  got.  At  the  end  of  a  month</span><span>  40  new  players  had  been  added  to</span><span>  the  attenuated  orchestra.  Thc</span><span>  aged  came  out  of  retirement  and</span><span>  an.  incapacity  for  war  work,  the</span><span>  war-broken  youthful  -  came  out  of</span><span>  hospitals  and  convalescent  homes,</span><span>  all  drawn  by  the  same  invisible</span><span>  strings-the  inherent  love  of  good</span><span>  music.  In  July.  Bradford  emerged</span><span>  from  its  dug-out  to  hear  a  new</span><span>  Halle  orchestra  that,  in  the  first</span><span>  six  months  of  its  existence,  it  gave</span><span>  126  concerts  to  a  quarter  of  a  mil-</span><span>  lion  delighted,  war-worn  folk  in</span><span>  34  different  towns.  Manchester</span><span>  got  its  first  concert  in  August.,</span><span>  when  6000  people  flocked  into</span><span>  King's  Hall  to  welcome  the  resur-</span><span>  rection.  !:  Being  portion  of  a  circus</span><span>  King's  Hall  was  less  ornate  than</span><span>  it  sounds,  but  by  a  wizardry  of</span><span>  improvisation  the  acoustics  proved</span><span>  to  be  as  good,  if  not  better  than</span><span>  those  of  most  concert  halls.  So</span><span>  Manchestriáns  of  brows  both  high</span></p> <p><span>  and  low  flocked  in  their  thousands</span></p> <p><span>  through  avenues  of  grotesque</span><span>  figures  and  gaudy  signs  of  great</span><span>  allurement  to  youth  to  King's  Hall</span><span>  that,  surrounded  by  monkey  nouses</span><span>  and  merry-go-rounds,  had  a  seat-</span><span>  ing  capacity  of  6000.  That  capacity</span><span>  was  seldom  adequate.</span></p> <p><span>  By  Christmas,  1944,  Lancastrians</span><span>  in  their  thousands  were  on  the</span><span>  Continent  assisting  to  drive  the</span><span>  Hun  back  into  Germany,  and  it</span><span>  was  decided  that  the  Halie  concerte</span><span>  would  shift  to  Europe  for  a  short</span><span>  season.  Crossing  the  English</span><span>  Channel  had  been  cleared  of  many</span><span>  of  its  military  perils,  but  nobody</span><span>  could  do  anything  about  the</span><span>  weather,  which  staged  a  blanket</span><span>  fog  that.  immobilised  their  troop-</span><span>  ship  in  mid-channel  and  shut  them</span><span>  out  of  Brussels,  where  they  were</span><span>  billed  to  play  that  ""  night.  But</span><span>  Brussels'  loss  was  the  gain  of</span><span>  many  hundreds  of  war-bound  sol-</span><span>  diers,  who  were  given  an  im-</span><span>  promptu  concert  of  light  music</span><span>  from  dance  tune  scripts,  scribbled</span><span>  on  the  backs  of  old  envelopes  with</span><span>  soldiers  as  music  stands.  Truly</span><span>  is  the  love  of  music  where  you</span></p> <p><span>  find  it.</span></p> <p><span>  During  that  tour  the  concert</span><span>  party  was  machine-gunned,  an</span><span>  oboeist  fell  in  a  shell  bole  and</span><span>  hroke  her  arm,  three  players  went</span><span>  dowr4  with  ?flu  but  the  Halie  con-</span><span>  cert  party,  clad  in  overcoats  and</span><span>  Balaclava  helmets,  pl  va  ed  to  20.000</span><span>  delighted  troops  in""  Belgium  and</span><span>  Holland.  On  this  and  subsequent</span><span>  tours  through  Britain,  the  51  men</span><span>  and  $3  women  who  make  up  the</span><span>  oreliestra  travelled  far  and  lived</span><span>  hard,  a  two-hour  performance</span></p> <p><span>  after  a  12-hour  motor  coach  jour-</span><span>  ney  being  the  rule,  and  not  the</span></p> <p><span>  exception.  It  was  then  that  they  !</span></p> <p><span>  found  there  are  two  Barbirollis</span><span>  one  who  from  his  rostrum  drove</span><span>  them  without  mercy  ;  the  other</span><span>  who.  at  lorry  drivers*  ""  pull  ins  ""</span><span>  and  emergency  roadhouses,  was</span><span>  attentive  waiter  to  women  and</span><span>  elderly  folk.</span></p> <p><span>  Meanwhile,  Halle's  was  homeless</span><span>  but  hopeful,  its  prestige  having</span><span>  soared  to  new  heights,  the  spirit</span></p> <p><span>  which  it  inherited  from  its  founder</span></p> <p><span>  never  more  indomitable.

With  the  realisation  that</span><span>  Australia's""  future  prosperity  must</span><span>  depend  to  a  large  extent  .upon  oar</span><span>  ability  -to'  achieve  and  maintain  a</span><span>  footing  iú  oufanVIeK:markets  for</span><span>  manufactured  articles  as  well  'as,</span><span>  for  .primary  products;  ;a  state'  bor-,</span><span>  dering  on.  alarm  is;  assailing  ;the</span><span>  Federal  í  MíSistry.  t>f  Commercé,]</span></p> <p><span>  which  controls  Commonwealth-  ex-</span></p> <p><span>  port  trade.  .  ~  /  :</span></p> <p><span>  .Little  more  than  a  ""week  ago  the</span><span>  Minister  for  Commerce  (Mr  Pol-:</span><span>  lard)  intimated  that  Australian  ex-</span><span>  port"",'methods  .fell  far  below  stand-</span><span>  ard.

Until</span><span>  recent  yean  Commonwealth  ex-</span><span>  ports  consisted  mainly  of  bulk</span><span>  commodities,  but  in  the  case  of  cer-</span><span>  tain  products,  especially'fruit,  we</span><span>  had  to  learn.  painful  lessons  con-</span><span>  cerning  the  necessity  for  better</span><span>  packing  and  grading.

That  re-</span><span>  sponsibility  devolves  firstly  upon</span><span>  the  ""manufacturer  and.,  almost</span><span>  equally,  upon  the  Government  to  en-</span><span>  sure  that  the  Unscrupulous  few</span><span>  who.do  notintend.to  remain  in</span><span>  the  export  insiness  are  prevented</span><span>  from  .entering  ît  at  all.</span></p> <p><span>  Unfortunately  the*charge  of  slip-</span><span>  shod  ;-methods  in  the  preparation  of</span><span>  goods  ¿or  public  consumption  is  not</span><span>  confined  to  exporters.  The  ""Bul-</span><span>  letin's^  Brisbane  correspondent  this</span></p> <p><span>  week  gave  an  account  of  a  mau</span><span>  who  purchased  a  couple  of  bearing</span><span>  blocks  for  his  irrigation  plant.</span><span>  They  were  made  in  Australia  but</span></p> <p><span>  I  were  described  aB  ""a  disgrace  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  name.""

The</span><span>  i  correspondent  commented:  ""What</span></p> <p><span>  !  engineers  overseas  would  think</span></p> <p><span>  of  such,  rubbishy  stuff,  is  not  hard</span><span>  to  imagine;  the  first  order  would</span><span>  be  the  last  and  worse  still  Austra-</span></p> <p><span>  lian  goods  as  a  whole  would  gain  a</span></p> <p><span>  bad  name.""</span></p> <p><span>  Nor  does  such  -  workmanship</span><span>  apply  only  to  bearing  blocks  turned</span><span>  out  by  machine  shops.

Many  thousands</span><span>  of  those  hours  are  to  be  seen  in</span><span>  and  about  a  large  percentage  of</span><span>  Rockhampton  homes,  among  which</span><span>  the  tidy  back  yard  and  well</span><span>  trimmed  flower  and  vegetable  gar-</span></p> <p><span>  den  are  the  exception  and  not  the</span><span>  rule.  There  is  little  enough  excuse</span><span>  even  now  for  anybody  living  amid</span><span>  the  desolation  of  untidiness  and</span><span>  neglect;  but  with  four  extra  hours</span><span>  of  leisure  per  week  such  shiftless-</span><span>  ness  becomes  simply  inexcusable.</span><span>  That  is  to  say,  if  a  man  is  to  sell</span></p> <p><span>  less  time  to  an  employer  to  qualify</span></p> <p><span>  for  his  weekly  wage,  it  is  always</span><span>  open  to  him  to  sell  it  to  himself</span><span>  so  as  to  brighten  and  improve  his</span><span>  surroundings  and  those  of  his</span><span>  family.</span></p> <p><span>  But  that  is  mere  scratching  the</span><span>  surface  of  the  business,  though  if</span></p> <p><span>  in  improving  his  surroundings  the</span></p> <p><span>  worker  is  also  improving  his  mental</span><span>  outlook  the  surface  will  have  been</span></p> <p><span>  scratched  to  some  purpose.  But</span></p> <p><span>  so  far  his  leaders  end  their  leading</span><span>  when  they  ensure  for  him  that  he</span><span>  works  fewer  hours  for  his  em-</span><span>  ployer.  They  tell  him  that  he  will</span><span>  be  that  much  better  off,  but  do  not</span><span>  say  how;  just  as  they  say  that</span></p> <p><span>  the  State  will  be  that  much  bettei</span></p> <p><span>  off,  also  without  saying  how.  If</span><span>  the  employees'  condition  is  im-</span><span>  proved  by  doing  less  work,  and  the</span><span>  State's  condition  is  improved  by</span><span>  there  being  more  work-left-undone</span><span>  none,  of  Australia's  industrial  lead-ers  has  explained  why  people  in</span><span>  every  other  country  on  earth-  in-</span></p> <p><span>  cluding  Soviet  Russia  -  try  to</span><span>  reach  the  same  condition  by  work-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  harder  and  longer.  It  is,  of</span><span>  course,  no  business  of  ours  what</span><span>  people  do  in  other  countries,  ex-</span><span>  cepting  maybe  to  note  what  steps</span><span>  they  take  to  reach  a  given  result;</span><span>  but  it  is  our  business  to  know  why</span></p> <p><span>  the  rest  of  the  world  is  so  con-</span><span>  sistently  out  of  step  with  Aus-</span></p> <p><span>  tralia.</span></p> <p><span>  While  this  dementia  is  going</span><span>  forward  the  Queensland  Govern-</span><span>  ment  statistician  tells  a  sorry  tale</span><span>  of  shrinking  stock  numbers.  There</span><span>  is  no  40-hour  week  among  the  fac-</span><span>  tors  that  eat  into  flocks  and  herds,</span><span>  and  far  too  many  of  these  shrink-</span><span>  ages  come  from  working  too  few</span></p> <p><span>  hours  out  among  the  live  stock.</span><span>  We  lost  154,100  dairy  cows,  in  milk</span><span>  and  dry,  between  the  year  1943</span><span>  and  that,  which  closed  at  the  end  of</span><span>  March  last,  and  nobody  can  pre-</span><span>  tend  that  that  was  good  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  State.  Some  of  them-  but  not</span></p> <p><span>  nearly  as  many  as  politicians  de-</span><span>  clare-  were  drought  victims;  but</span><span>  even  so  their  end  was  hastened  by</span><span>  the  amazing  policy  of  the  Curtin</span><span>  Government,  which  subsidised</span><span>  wheat  farmers  in  Western  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  to  the  extent  of  millions</span><span>  not  to  grow  wheat.  Chances  of</span><span>  recovery  in  numbers  of  dairy  cows</span><span>  is  not  bright,  there  being  a  drop</span><span>  in  the  same  period  of  128,000</span><span>  heifers  of  one  year  and  over  and</span><span>  of  calves  of  one  year  and  under.</span><span>  Feed  rationing,  made  imperative  by</span><span>  keeping  Western  Australian  wheat</span><span>  farmers  out  of  production,  had</span><span>  much  to  do  with  this  decline;  but</span><span>  the  bobby  calf  industry  also  helped.</span></p> <p><span>  It  offered  a  market  for  an  animal</span><span>  that  might  otherwise  die  of  star-</span><span>  vation,  even  though  it  lingered  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  tax  return.</span></p> <p><span>  Beef  cattle  dropped  off  in  the</span><span>  aggregate  by  365  000,  of  which</span><span>  276,000  was  in  the  cow  and  heifer</span><span>  or  breeder  class,  and  another  203,000</span><span>  was  made  up  of  calves  of  a  year</span><span>  or  under.  Fewer  beef  cattle  die</span></p> <p><span>  of  starvation  than  do  dairy  cattle,</span><span>  but  the  dingo  toll-due  to  fewer</span><span>  man-hours  worked  against  them</span><span>  is  higher  and  is  shown  in  the  calf</span><span>  losses.  Another  factor  is  taxa-</span></p> <p><span>  tion,  as  there  is  little  encourage-</span><span>  ment  to  mate  breeding  cattle  on  a</span><span>  basis  of  18/6  in  every  20/-  for  Mr</span><span>  Chifley,  so  that  and  the  dingo  have</span><span>  worked  amicably  together.  A  sig-</span></p> <p><span>  nificant  item  is  an  increase  of</span><span>  206,000  bullocks  and  spayed  cows,</span><span>  really  due  to  strikes  at  meatworks,</span><span>  leaving  unkilled  that  number  of</span><span>  bullocks  that  should  have  gone  to</span><span>  Britain.  Not  even  Australia  can</span></p> <p><span>  for  long  stand  that  kind  of  foolery,</span><span>  and  somebody  should  explain  how</span></p> <p><span>  the  40-hour  week  is  going  to  help</span><span>  turn  these  surplus  beasts  info  beef:</span><span>  i.e.,  from  a  liability  into  an  asset.</span></p> <p><span>  Sheep  are  in  a  bad  way,  for  in</span><span>  the  five  years  to  1947  we  lost</span><span>  9  570  000  of  them  in  all  classes,  or</span><span>  37  per  cent  of  the  1943  flock!</span><span>  That,  of  course,  is  in  addition  to</span><span>  the  natural  increase  for  those</span><span>  years,  as  indeed  obtains  also  in  the</span><span>  case  of  beef  and  dairy  cattle.  All</span><span>  ewes  of  a  year  or  over  declined</span><span>  by  3  790  000  and  there  were</span><span>  2  440  000  fewer  young  stock</span><span>  under  a  year  at  the  end  of  March</span><span>  last  than  there  was  in  March,  1943.</span><span>  Unchecked  dingoes  and  drought  be-</span><span>  tween  them  are  responsible  for  the</span><span>  major  part  of  this  smash.  Pigs,</span><span>  too,  are  down  in  the  same  period</span><span>  by  69,000,  or  20  per  cent,  due</span><span>  wholly  to  shortage  of  rationed</span><span>  feid  while  Westralian  wheat  grow-</span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  ers  got  paid  not  to  grow  wheat!</span></p> <p><span>  The  only  inescapable  factor  here</span><span>  was  drought,  and  even  its  effects</span><span>  might  have  been  mitigated  had  not</span><span>  the  Curtin  Government  showmen</span><span>  rushed  every  able-bodied  man  into</span><span>  the  army,  and  then  built  up  the</span><span>  Curtin  Line  So  that  our  armies</span><span>  could  not  go  with  our  Allies.  Hun-</span></p> <p><span>  dreds  of  thousands  of  men  who</span><span>  never  left  Australia  could  have</span></p> <p><span>  been  tending  our  precious  flocks</span><span>  and  herds,  and  now  that  millions</span><span>  of  the  world's  people  are  on  the</span><span>  brink  of  starvation  the  only  in-</span><span>  crease  in  the  animal  kingdom  in</span><span>  Queensland  is  in  the  ranks  of  the</span><span>  dingo  clan.  This  is  the  record</span><span>  of  reduced  man-hours  in  the  pas-</span><span>  toral  industry  over  the  past  five</span><span>  years,  and  much  of  the  unfinished</span><span>  work  that  contributed  to  it  is  still</span><span>  undone.  On  the  basis  of  the  40-</span><span>  hour  week,  when  it  will  be  im-</span><span>  possible  to  get  men  away  from</span><span>  the  bright  lights  of  the  city,  it</span><span>  appears  as  if  this  calamitous  show-</span><span>  ing  it  but  the  beginning  of  even</span></p> <p><span>  worse  to  come.</span></p> ",Article,1947-09-04,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1947. 4[?] HOURS, DROUGHT AND DINGOES.",56794538,4,4,"{'score': '4260.313', 'value': 'very relevant'}","While exponents of the 40-hou[?] week are extolling its moral uplift and material benefit to both the State and the individual,","{'id': '77', 'value': 'Morning Bulletin (Rockhampton, Qld. : 1878 - 1954)'}",https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/56794538?searchTerm=%27Morning+Bulletin%27,/newspaper/56794538,"Morning Bulletin (Rockhampton, Qld. : 1878 - 1954)",77

As</span><span>  a  fact  títere  is  a  world  -wide  shor-</span><span>  tage  of  alkalis,  even  America  being</span><span>  unable  to  produce  to  full  require-</span><span>  ments.  Australia  has  trebled  con-</span><span>  sumption  in  the  last  10  years,  and</span><span>  the  establishment  of  new  industries</span><span>  during  and  since  the  war  has  caused,</span><span>  consumption  to  overtake  supply,</span><span>  i  Shortages  will  continue  until  the</span><span>  new  ?plant  begins  to  step  up  out</span><span>  Iput..</span></p> <p><span>  I  South  Australia  is  fortunate  in</span><span>  having  the  only  existing  works  in</span><span>  'operation,  and  more  so  in  having</span><span>  the  .  saltSeld  deposits  which  form</span><span>  the  baisis.  pf  .these  products.  It  is  an</span><span>  economic  truth  that  secondary  in-</span><span>  dustries'  should  be  based  on  sup-</span><span>  plies  of  raw  materials,  and  in  fact</span><span>  this  must  be  the  guiding  principle</span><span>  of  decentralisation  bf  industry</span><span>  which  is  now  the  stated  policy  of</span><span>  'all  governments.  But  whilst  it  has</span></p> <p><span>  the  raw  material  in  the  salt  fields,</span><span>  South  Australia  suffers  a  serious</span></p> <p><span>  handicap  in  respect  of  coal  which</span><span>  ig  equally  essential  to  industrial</span><span>  production.  South  Australia's  only</span><span>  coal  is  the  Leigh  Creek  field,  which</span><span>  ia  totally  inadequate  and  it  is</span><span>  frankly  admitted  by  the  Fermier  of</span><span>  the  State  that  coal  for  the  opera-</span><span>  tion  of  the  new  works  will  have  to</span><span>  be  brought  from  NSW</span></p> <p><span>  Queensland  will  not  quarrel  with</span><span>  the  principle  of  basing  secondary</span><span>  industries  at  the  source  of  raw</span><span>  material  because  it  happens  to  be</span><span>  in  another  State,  but  in  conceding</span><span>  the  principle  it  is  entitled  to  insist</span><span>  on  its  rights  in  the  same  regard.  If</span><span>  South  Australia  getg  the  alkali</span><span>  works  on  account  of  its  salt  fields</span><span>  and  NSW  steelworks  because  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  proximity  of  coal  and  iron,  Queens-</span><span>  land,  and  Central  Queensland  more</span><span>  so,  is  entitled  to  wool  and  hide</span><span>  processing  because  of  its  com-</span><span>  manding  position  in  the  production</span><span>  of  those  raw  materials.  We  are  in  a</span></p> <p><span>  particularly  favourable  situation  as</span><span>  regards  coal  deposits  that  are  as</span><span>  yet  scarcely  touched,  but  which  still</span><span>  somehow  appear  to  escape  the</span><span>  notice  .of  those  behind  the  present</span><span>  industrial  expansioB^in  Australia.</span></p> <p><span>  Recently  a  RocS&ampton  mer-</span></p> <p><span>  chant  was  in  Adelaide  and,</span><span>  attended  an  industrial  exhibition  of</span><span>  manufactures  made  in  that  State</span><span>  which  really  amazed  him.  It  hap-</span><span>  pened  that  he  was  called  upon  to</span><span>  respond  at  an  official  luncheon,  and</span><span>  in  doing  so  remarked  that  what</span><span>  amazed  him  was  not  so  much  the</span><span>  variety  and  excellence  of  the  goods</span><span>  displayed  as  the  fact  that  they</span><span>  were  being  manufactured  in  a  State</span><span>  that  wag  virtually  without  coal,</span><span>  whilst  Central  Queensland,  with  a</span><span>  vast  area  of  untapped  coal  re-</span><span>  sources,  was  virtually  without  in-</span><span>  dustries.  This  comment  resulted</span><span>  after  the  luncheon  in  his  being</span><span>  asked  many  questions  about  this</span><span>  region,  particularly  the  coal  deposits</span><span>  to  which  he  had  referred.  To  his</span><span>  surprise  he  found  that  his  inter-</span><span>  rogators  confessed  they  had  little</span><span>  or  no  knowledge  of  our  wealth  in</span><span>  this  connexion.</span></p> <p><span>  South  Australia's  advanced  posi-</span><span>  tion  and  Queensland  g  back  seat  in</span><span>  industry  are  not  entirely  due  io  the</span><span>  incidence  of  natural  resources.
