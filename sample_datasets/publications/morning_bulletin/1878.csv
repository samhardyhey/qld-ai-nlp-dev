"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  DECEMBER  24,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  progress  of  Time  has  brought  our</span><span>  lives  to  another  landmark  ;  and,  like</span><span>  travellers  who  have  reached  an  oasis  in</span><span>  the  desert,  it  is  fitting  that  we  rest  awhile</span><span>  and  enjoy  the  bright  scene  around  us.</span><span>  The  great  event  which  occurred  nearly</span><span>  two  thousand  years  ago,  and  which  will</span><span>  be  commemorated  to-morrow  in  every</span><span>  nation  where  Christianity  has  found  an</span><span>  entrance,  was  in  its  religious  aspect  the</span><span>  most  momentous  ever  recorded  in</span></p> <p><span>  history.  But  it  is  not  in  this  respect</span><span>  that  the  approach  of  Christmas  chiefly</span><span>  forms  a  theme  for  the  public</span><span>  journalist  While  the  day  will  suggest</span><span>  to  many  the  most  exalted  sentiments  in</span><span>  connection  witli  the  Christian  faith,  to</span><span>  all  it  will  be  regarded  as  a  time  for</span><span>  festive  and  rational  enjoyment.  Man-</span></p> <p><span>  kind  are  now  the  same  in  essential</span><span>  characteristics  as  they  ever  were,  and  in</span><span>  every  nation,  no  matter  how  hard  its</span><span>  inhabitants  may  have  to  strive  for  a</span><span>  living  or  submit  to  the  necessities  of</span><span>  grinding  toil,  they  have  always  found</span><span>  means  for  relaxation  and  times  of  general</span><span>  rejoicing.  The  Greeks  had  their</span><span>  Olympic,  Isthmian,  Nemean,  and</span><span>  Pythian  games  ;  the  Romans  their  great</span><span>  games  and  festivals  ;  the  southern  nations</span><span>  of  modern  Europe  have  their  carnivals  ;</span><span>  but  in  Anglo-Saxon  communities  Christ-</span><span>  mas-tide  is  eminently  the  time  of  family</span><span>  re-unions  and  national  festivities.  Daily</span><span>  toil,  with  its  worry  and  care,  is  for  the</span><span>  moment  forgotten,  and  every  one  enters</span><span>  heart  and  soul  into  the  pleasures  pro-</span></p> <p><span>  vided  for  the  festal  season.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  Christina*;  comes  but  once  a  year.</span></p> <p><span>  And  when  it  comes  it  brings  good  cheer.""</span></p> <p><span>  That  the  influence  produced  by  the</span><span>  recurrence  of  the  holiday  is  in  every  way</span><span>  beneficial,  there  cannot  be  the  shadow</span><span>  of  doubt.  It  is  a  counterpoise  against</span><span>  the  predominant  selfishness  that  the  rules</span><span>  of  business  impose  upon  us,  and  opens</span><span>  the  heart  to  generous  and  hospitable  im-</span><span>  pulses.  Love,  the  greatest  of  the  Chris-</span><span>  tian  graces,  seems  then  to  exercise  a</span><span>  stronger  influence  than  at  other  times  ;  we</span><span>  dislike  to  mar  our  enjoyment  by  intro-</span><span>  ducing  the  element  of  strife,  and  the</span><span>  spirit  of  forgiveness  is  happily  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  ascendant.  The  ancients  had  a  beauti-</span><span>  ful  custom  which  gave  a  practical  appli-</span><span>  cation  to  this  sentiment.  When  a</span><span>  suppliant  entered  the  house  even</span><span>  of  his  greatest  enemy  and  seated</span><span>  himself  on  the  hearth  by  the</span><span>  household  gods,  his  person  was  held</span><span>  sacred,  and  no  violence  was  used  against</span><span>  him.  And  in  the  same  way  our  feast  of</span><span>  Christmas  has  frequently  been  used  by</span><span>  the  peacemaker,  and  made  the  means  of</span><span>  reconciling  those  who  for  years  previously</span><span>  have  lived  ia  «otrangamcnt.</span></p> <p><span>  But  it  is  in  the  family  relation  that  the</span><span>  festal  season  exercises  its  most  attractive</span><span>  and  beDign  influences.  Members  who</span><span>  may  have  been  separated  for  years  re-</span><span>  unite  under  the  well-known  roof;  and</span><span>  while  a  survey  of  the  guests  may  draw</span><span>  from  the  family  circle  a  sigh  of  sadness  for</span><span>  those  who  are  missing,  the  general  feeling</span><span>  is  of  gladness  and  thankfulness  for  those</span><span>  who  have  been  spared  to  take  part  in</span><span>  the  happy  reunion.  And  the  merry</span><span>  voices,  the  bright  smiles,  the  good</span><span>  natured  banter,  the  lively  bustle,  the</span><span>  appetising  dishes,  the  cheering  wine,  and</span><span>  the  general  happiness,  show  one  of  the</span><span>  brightest  aspects  of  human  life,  and</span><span>  teach  the  reflective  mind  that  there  are</span><span>  things  more  desirable  than  mere  money</span><span>  grubbing.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Christmas  of  187S  finds  us  in</span><span>  circumstances  which,  though  not  so</span><span>  bright  as  they  might  be,  might  easily  be</span><span>  much  worse.  Central  Queensland  es-</span><span>  pecially  has  reason  to  be  thankful  for</span><span>  the  break  up  of  the  drought  which  has</span><span>  been  so  disastrous  to  this  and  the  other</span></p> <p><span>  Australian  colonies.  It  would  hardly  be</span><span>  possible  to  conceive  of  a  better  season</span><span>  than  we  have  had  throughout  the  year,</span><span>  the  rain  coming  exactly  when  it  was</span><span>  wanted,  and  spreading  abundant  verdure</span><span>  over  the  land.  It  may  reasonably  be</span><span>  expected,  also,  that  for  some  years</span><span>  prosperous  seasons  will  reward  the</span><span>  the  labour  of  the  agriculturist  and  the</span><span>  squatter.  If  so,  the  losses  will  soon  be</span><span>  made  good,  and  the  colony  will  again</span><span>  enter  upon  a  period  of  general  prosperity.</span><span>  The  causes  which  have  operated,  and</span><span>  are  still  operating,  to  darken  the  picture,</span><span>  are  well  known  to  our  readers,  and  we</span><span>  need  not  now  revert  to  them.  The</span></p> <p><span>  yearly  round  of  toil  has  nearly  run.</span><span>  If  it  has  brought  its  troubles  it  has  also</span><span>  brought  its  enjoyments.  Let  us,  then,</span><span>  like  Horace,  throw  aside  dull  care,  and</span><span>  look,  even  so  briefly,  at  the  laughing  side</span><span>  of  life;  let  the  plenty  which  crowns  our</span><span>  board,  while  evoking  a  spirit  of  thankful-</span><span>  ness,  also  lead  us  to  feel  more  deeply  for</span><span>  the  harder  lot  of  the  poor;  let  the</span><span>  geniality  and  kindness  which  characterise</span><span>  the  feast  not  disappear  with  it,  but  con-</span><span>  tinue  their  influence  on  our  lives.  If</span></p> <p><span>  such  feelings  animate  us,  as  they  should</span><span>  do,  we  shall  indeed  be  like  travellers</span><span>  who  renew  their  exhausted  vigour,  and</span><span>  take  in  a  supply  of  refreshment  for  the</span><span>  journey  yet  to  come.  And  that  the</span><span>  festivities  of  the  season  may  be  thus  en-</span><span>  joyed  by  all  of  us,  we  heartily  unite  in</span><span>  the  customary  salutation,  and  wish</span><span>  our  readers  ""A  merry  Christmas  and</span><span>  a  happy  New  Year.""</span></p> <p><span>  AT  tho  Police  Court  yesterday,  before  the</span><span>  Police  Magistrate,  two  drunkards  who  had</span><span>  been  carefully  looked  after  in  thc  lock-up</span><span>  since  Saturday  were  discharged  with  an</span><span>  admonition  as  to  their  future  proceedings.  A</span><span>  female  was  remitted  to  the  Deception  House</span></p> <p><span>  for  medical  care  and  treatment.  Patrick</span></p> <p><span>  Egan  uss  summoned  by  Mr.  James  Russ,</span><span>  Inspector  of  Brands,  for  committing  two</span><span>  breaches  of  the  Brands  Act.  The  defendant</span><span>  pleaded  guilty,  and  after  the  evidence  of  the</span><span>  complainant  had  been  taken,  decision  was</span><span>  reserved  until  this  morning.  The  Police</span><span>  Offices  will  bc  closed  to-morrow  and  the</span><span>  following  day  for  thc  usual  Christmas</span><span>  holidays,</span></p> <p><span>  IN  order  to  gira  our  staff  an  opportunity  of</span><span>  enjoying  thc  holidays,  thc  Bidbiin,  in  accor-</span><span>  dance  with  our  usual  custom,  Mill  not  be</span><span>  published  on  Christmas  Day  or  Boxing  Day.</span></p> <p><span>  The  publishing  office  will,  however,  he  open  j</span><span>  after  seven  o'clock  on  Thursday  evening  for  j</span></p> <p><span>  the  receipt  of  business  notices  for  Friday's</span></p> <p><span>  paper.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Charters  Towers  Christmas  Races  take</span><span>  place  on  the  26th  and  27th  instant.

Mr.  J.  Wakofield,  Brigade</span><span>  Superintendent,  and  Messrs.  It.  L.  Dibdin</span><span>  and  G.  S.  Curtis,  representatives  of  the</span><span>  Queensland  and  Kew  Zealand  Insurance  Com-</span><span>  panies,  accordingly  met  Mr.  Macdonnell  in  the</span><span>  Police  Magistrate's  room  to  discuss  thc  sub-</span><span>  ject.  The  benefits  likely  to  accrue  from  thc</span><span>  operations  of  thc  Act  in  Rockhampton  were</span><span>  pointed  out  by  Mr.  Macdonnell  ;  but  in  thc</span><span>  absence  of  seroral  local  firms,  acting  for  in-</span><span>  surance  companies,  it  was  thought  premature</span><span>  to  take  any  steps  in  thc  matter  without  an</span><span>  expression  of  opinion  from  them.  It  was</span><span>  therefore  decided  to  convene  a  meeting  of  all</span><span>  persons  interested,  and  request  the  attendance</span><span>  of  his  Worship  the  Mayor  at  the  Council</span><span>  Chamber,  this  afternoon  at  4*30,  to  discuss</span><span>  the  question.</span></p> <p><span>  FROM  our  Northern  files  we  learn  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  Supreme  Court  sittings  commenced  at  Cook-</span><span>  town  before  Mr.  Justice  Sheppard  on  thc  5th</span><span>  instant,  Mr.  Pope  A.  Cooper  prosecuting  for</span><span>  the  Crown.  There  were  only  two  criminal</span><span>  cases  on  tho  calendar,  namely,  George  Healy,</span><span>  who  pleaded  guilty  to  attempting  to  commit</span><span>  suicide,  and  William  Rodgers,  who  was</span><span>  indicted  for  the  murder  of  Duck  On,  a  Chinese</span><span>  miner,  at  Stewart  Town.  The  former  prisoner</span><span>  was  bound  over  in  his  own  recognisances  to  bc</span><span>  of  good  behaviour  for  twelve  months,  and</span><span>  the  latter  prisoner  was  acquitted,  thc  verdict</span><span>  eliciting  applause,  which  was  promptly  sup-</span><span>  pressed.  The  Townsville  District  Court</span><span>  opened  on  the  16th  instant,  before  His  Honor</span><span>  Judgo  Hely,  Mr.  Chubb  prosecuting  for  the</span><span>  Crown.  A  Chinaman  named  Ah  Chow</span><span>  received  a  sentence  of  two  months'  imprison-</span><span>  ment  in  Townsville  Gaol  for  passing  a  base</span><span>  coin  purporting  to  be  a  sovereign.  The</span><span>  prisoner,  it  appears,  had  been  awaiting  trial</span><span>  since  August  12.  This  was  the  only  criminal</span></p> <p><span>  case,</span></p> <p><span>  WE  are  in  receipt  of  a  few  items  from</span><span>  Cometville  with  reference  to  the  approaching</span><span>  races,  on  New  Year's  Day,  at  that  township.</span><span>  Three  booths  were  sold  on  Saturday  last,  all  of</span><span>  which  were  purchased  by  Mrs.  Fanny  Clark,</span><span>  realising  £40  6s.  The  stewards  have  been</span><span>  fortunate  enough  to  find,  and  will  use,  a  new</span><span>  course  near  the  Springsure  road,  on  tile  banks</span><span>  of  the  Comet  river,  about  two  miles  and  a  half</span><span>  from  the  town.  The  site  ÍB  described  as  a</span><span>  grand  one-a  natural  pocket  or  meadow  in  the</span><span>  midst  of  the  scrub  or  open  forest</span><span>  that  surrounds  it.  Our  correspondent</span><span>  continues:-""It  is  perfectly  clear  and  well</span><span>  grassed,  with  beautiful  shrubs  surround-</span><span>  ing  it  in  a  circle,  imparting  to  the  wholo  the</span><span>  scenery  and  appearance  of  an  English  park.</span><span>  It  is  pronounced  by  horse-trainers  now  using</span><span>  it  the  best  course  north  of  Randwick.""  If  up</span><span>  to  expectation,  the  Comet  people  are  to  be</span></p> <p><span>  congratulated  on  this  lucky  find,  and  thc  race-</span><span>  course  will  become  popular.  The  stewards</span><span>  are  arranging  for  a  second  day's  racing,  and</span><span>  the  Traffic  Manager  has  been  communicated</span><span>  with  to  extend  the  time  for  down  return</span><span>  tickets  to  the  3rd  January  instead  of  the  2nd,</span><span>  as  advertised.  Altogether,  there  promises  to</span><span>  be  good  sport  on  the  occasion,  and  the  stewards</span><span>  are  evidently  endeavouring  to  meet  the  wishes</span><span>  of  visitors  from  Rockhampton.</span></p> <p><span>  FROM  the  preparations  that  arc  being  made</span><span>  for  the  approaching  holidays,  the  public  seem</span><span>  bent  on  enjoying  themselves  to  the  full.  On</span><span>  Saturday  night  last  several  of  tho  shops  of  the</span><span>  town  were  illuminated  in  ingenious  ways,  and</span><span>  those  that  vend  the  innumerable  varieties  of</span></p> <p><span>  Christmas  presents  have  dono  a  good  business,</span><span>  notwithstanding  the  prevailing  dulness.  To-</span><span>  morrow  will  of  course  be  observed  as  a  close</span><span>  hobday,  and  whatever  amusements  there  may</span><span>  be  will  be  of  festive  and  social  character.  On</span><span>  Boxing  Day  there  are  the  competing  at-</span></p> <p><span>  tractions  of  the  North  side  races,  Mr.  Penc'B  ,</span></p> <p><span>  gardens,  railway  excursions,  picnic  parties,  j</span></p> <p><span>  and  etceteras  that  have  not  come  before  the</span><span>  public.  In  thc  evening  the  Royal  Illusionists</span><span>  promise  a  really  good  entertainment,  and  one</span><span>  which  must  bo  interesting  to  those  of  us  who</span><span>  are  not  instructed  in  the  marvels  of  modern</span><span>  spiritualism.  Articles  flying  through  the  air,</span><span>  musical  instruments  playing  without  handB,</span><span>  and  other  wonders  are  in  their  repertoire,</span><span>  which  comprises,  we  aro  told,  the  illusions  so</span><span>  successfully  being  exhibited  in  Melbourne  by</span><span>  Baldwin,  and  which  has  created  such  dismay</span><span>  amongst  spiritualists,  the  performers  asserting</span><span>  that  everything  is  done  by  human  agency.</span><span>  Both  bona  fide  spiritualists  and  their  exposers</span><span>  seem  to  be  making  a  good  thing  out  of  the</span><span>  business,  which,  after  all,  is  perhaps  in  some</span><span>  respects  identical  with  thc  occult  science  of</span><span>  the  Chaldaic  and  Egyptian  soothsayers.</span></p> <p><span>  A  TRAVELLER  who  hos  recently  arrived  in</span><span>  town  from  up-country  informs  us  that  the</span><span>  punt  or  boat  at  the  crossing  of  thc  Comet  on</span><span>  the  new  road  between  Lilyvale  and  Comet-</span><span>  ville,  is  in  a  disgraceful  condition.  He  was  a</span><span>  passenger  by  Cobb's  coach,  and  on  reaching</span><span>  the  ferny,  it  was  found  necessary  to</span><span>  use  thc  boat  in  order  to  cross  to  the</span><span>  coach  on  thc  other  Bide,  but  the  boat</span><span>  was  so  leaky  that  some  skill  was  required  to</span><span>  get  acrosB  without  a  wetting,  although  the</span><span>  water  was  at  the  time  only  a  few  yards  wide.</span><span>  There  being  ladies  among  the  passengers,  a</span><span>  rough  deck  was  improvised  by  placing  planks</span><span>  over  the  boat,  wliiht  during  the  crossing</span><span>  bailing  was  carried  on  as  actively  as</span><span>  possible  to  keep  the  boat  aSoat.  How-</span><span>  ever,  notwithstanding  these  efforts,  thc  boat</span><span>  by  the  time  it  reached  the  other  bank  was  on</span><span>  the  point  of  being  swamped,  as  not  more  than</span></p> <p><span>  a  few  inches  of  thc  bulwarks  were  out  of  thc</span><span>  water.  It  does  seem  absurd  that  a  line  o'</span><span>  coaches,  subsidised  for  mail  purposes,  should</span><span>  be  dependent  on  a  dilapidated  ferry  of  this</span><span>  description,  and  wc  would  call  thc</span><span>  attention  of  thc  Covernmcut  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  immediate  necessity  of  providing  a  better</span><span>  boat,  unless  the  traffic  is  to  bc  brought  to  a</span><span>  standstill.  Thc  rainy  season  is  now  due,  and</span><span>  it  is  highly  probable  that  for  some  months  to</span><span>  come  tho  ferry  will  bc  needed.  It  is  perhaps</span><span>  unnecessary  to  add  that  thc  leaky  boat  now</span></p> <p><span>  in  use  is  not  only  exceedingly  inconvenieaj^</span><span>  but  really  dangerous,  and  no  considcratiou^H</span><span>  economy  can  justify  delay  in  the  provisional</span></p> <p><span>  a  proper  punt,</span></p> <p><span>  WE  are  credibly  informed  that  a  parcel  of</span><span>  lOozs.  7dwts.  of  gold,  the  result  of  thc</span><span>  crashing  of  fifteen  tons  of  stone,  was  brought</span><span>  into  town  yesterday  from  the  Crocodile  by</span><span>  Mr.  R.  Jefferie.  It  is  also  stated  that  Mr.  Â.</span><span>  Martin  having  suspended  operations  on  his</span><span>  claim,  the  ground  has  been  taken  possession  of</span><span>  by  titree  working  miners,  who  are  determined</span><span>  to  give  it  a  fair  trial.  Mr.  Einclilifle,  the</span><span>  proprietor  of  the  machine,  intends  erecting</span><span>  fresh  appliances  for  saving  gold,  and  it  is</span><span>  hoped  the  returns  in  future  will  be  more  satis-</span><span>  factory  than  of  late.  Taken  altogether  mining</span><span>  matters  seem  to  bc  looking  up  in  the  locality</span><span>  alluded  to,  ind  it  may  be  expected  that  the</span><span>  forthcoming  year  will  see  a  larger  yield  of  the</span><span>  precious  metal  from  the  Crocodile  than  the</span><span>  present  one.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  removal  of  Senior-Sergeant  Brannelly</span><span>  from  Rockhampton  will  be  a  matter  for  sincere</span><span>  regret  to  those  residents  of  this  part  of  the</span><span>  colony  who  have  had  an  opportunity  of  esti-</span><span>  mating  that  officer's  many  good  qualities,  and</span><span>  the  faithful  and  efficient  manner  in  which  he</span><span>  has  always  discharged  his  duties.  For  twelve</span><span>  years  he  was  stationed  at  Clermont,  where  he</span><span>  received  many  and  gratifying  proofs  of  the</span><span>  regard  and  esteem  in  which  he  waa  held  by</span><span>  the  residents  of  that  district.  It  is</span><span>  now  just  three  years  and  a-half  since</span><span>  he  was  transferred  to  Rockhampton,  and</span><span>  he  is  again  under  orders  for  another  district.</span><span>  On  the  eve  of  his  departure  from  Rockhampton</span><span>  the  following  highly  complimentary  letter  has</span><span>  been  addressed  to  him  by  the  Police  Magi-</span></p> <p><span>  strate  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""  Rockhampton,  December  Iß,  1878.</span><span>  To  Senior  Sergeant  nranneuy.</span></p> <p><span>  fciir,-I  have  heard  with  unfeigned  regret  of  your</span><span>  approaching  removal  from  Rucknarapton  to  Towus</span><span>  ville,  and  1  am  suro  that  ray  brother  magistrates  will</span><span>  ¡  coincide  with  me  in  stich  an  expression.

M.  Hunter,  W.  J.  Taylor,</span><span>  Joseph  llrown,  H.  W.  Risien,  George  B.  Shaw,</span><span>  William  Thomson,  Alfred  T.

Bcrkolman,  John  Headrick,  D.11</span><span>  Balmond,  H.  M.  Milman,  Justices  of  the  Peace.</span></p> <p><span>  Wc  are  quite  sure  that  the  sentiments  ex-</span><span>  pressed  in  Mr.  Pugh's  letter,  will_-be  heartily</span></p> <p><span>  endorsed  by  the  public  in  thia  district,  who  j</span><span>  will  wish  Senior-Sergeant  Brannelly  the  best</span><span>  success  and  prosperity  in  his  new  sphere  of</span><span>  duty.  He  proceeds  hence  to  Townsville,</span><span>  where  he  is  to  occupy  a  similar  position  to</span><span>  that  which  he  has  held  here.  Wc  regret  to</span><span>  say  that  we  cannot  regard  the  removal</span><span>  as  a  promotion,  for  Townsville  as  a</span><span>  police  station  is  no  way  superior  to</span><span>  Rockhampton,  whilst  the  expenses  of  removal,</span><span>  which  falls  almost  entirely  upon  Mr.  Bran-</span><span>  nelly  himself,  are  so  considerable  as  to  be</span><span>  practically  equivalent  to  a  material  reduction</span><span>  in  salary.  Mr.  Brannelly's  passage  money  is</span><span>  paid  by  the  Government,  but  this  is  a  mere</span><span>  trifle  in  comparison  with  the  travelling</span><span>  exponsoB  of  that  officer  and  his  family,  and</span><span>  thc  coat  entailed  upon  him  of  forming  a  new</span></p> <p><span>  home.  If  these  removals  are  for  the  benefit</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  public  service,  and  we  believe  that  as  a</span><span>  rule  they  arc  so,  it  is  only  fair  that  officers</span><span>  who  aro  subjected  to  them  should  have  all</span><span>  their  reasonable  expenses  defrayed  by  tho</span><span>  Government,  provided  they  are  efficient</span><span>  and  stand  well  in  their  department.</span><span>  We  are  aware  that  this  system  of  shifting</span><span>  officials  from  oue  district  to  another  is  not</span></p> <p><span>  confined  in  its  operation  to  members  of  the</span><span>  police,  but  extends  tn  police  magistrates  and</span><span>  other  classes  of  officials.  But  the  principle  is</span></p> <p><span>  not  the  less  indefensible  because  it</span></p> <p><span>  happens  to  bc  of  long  standing  and</span><span>  extensive  application,  and  we  certainly  think</span><span>  that  in  cases  whore  the  exigencies  of  the</span><span>  service  render  expedient  the  removal  of  an</span><span>  officer  from  one  part  of  thc  oolony  to  another</span><span>  the  expenses  thereby  necessitated  should  not</span><span>  bo  allowed  to  fall  upon  him,  unless  the</span><span>  removal  will  improve  his  position,  or  it  ¡B</span><span>  intended  indirectly  to  reduce  his  salary  and</span><span>  place  him  a  grade  lower  iu  the  service.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  ROADS  AND  THE  WEATHER.-Wc  have</span><span>  experienced  many  changes  in  thc  weather</span><span>  during  the  past  week,  and  are  thankful  for</span><span>  the  few  refreshing  showers  that  have  visited</span><span>  us.  On  Monday  the  heat  was  most  oppressive,</span><span>  hut  towards  five  o'clock,  a  delightful  shower</span><span>  passed  over,  making  thc  dust  behave  itself,</span><span>  but  nothing  moro.  On  Tuesday  evening  a</span><span>  storm  of  unusual  violence  passed  over  the  town</span><span>  of  Copperfield,  unroofing  several  houses  and</span><span>  blowing  down  large  trees.  The  large  weather-</span><span>  board  building  formerly  occupied  by  Mr.</span><span>  ChrÍBtoe,  is  minus  portion  of  its  roof,  and  the</span><span>  road  in  the  direction  of  Scrubby  Flat  boars</span><span>  evident  testimony  of  thc  violence  of  thc  storm,</span><span>  which  lasted  a  little  over  an  hour.  Not  much</span><span>  rain  fell  in  the  town,  but  the  appearance  of</span><span>  the  sky  in  the  direction  of  Peak  vale  would</span><span>  lead  one  to  suppose  that  a  good  downpour  of</span><span>  rain  visited  that  locality.  Theresa  Creek  was</span><span>  overflowing,  and  thc  flat  country  was  well</span><span>  covered  ;  the  grass  will  not  have  a  chance  to</span><span>  show  itself  again.  We  learn  that  heavy  rains</span><span>  have  also  fallen  at  thc  Connors,  thc  mailman</span><span>  reporting  the  country  flooded.  The  Belyando,</span><span>  too  was  a  banker,  providing  that  much  rain</span><span>  must  have  fallen  in  that  direction.  Tho  road</span><span>  from  Clermont  to  the  Comet  Terminus  is</span><span>  described  BS  heavy,  but  lots  of  good  feed  for</span><span>  cattle.  The  Nogoa  is  said  to  bc  uncrossable,</span><span>  os  is,  evidenced  by  the  delay  of  our  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  and  southern  mails.  The  usual  mail</span><span>  from  Rockhampton,  due  at  noon,  on  Monday</span><span>  last,  did  not  arrive  in  Clermont  until  after  six</span><span>  o'clock  on  Tuesday  evening,  and  then  only</span><span>  by  horses,  the  coach  being  stuck  fast  at</span><span>  Capella  ;  there  are  passengers  now  waiting  at</span><span>  Clermont  for  the  coach  to  Rockhampton,  and</span><span>  from  all  appearance  they  may  wait  a  little</span><span>  longer.  Many  Christmas  parcels  have  been</span><span>  auxiously  expected,  but  are  detained  in  con-</span><span>  sequence  of  the  non-arrival  of  thc  coach,  and</span><span>  there  appears  no  help  for  it  but  to  wait  and  wait</span><span>  on  until  direct  railway  communication  be</span><span>  established  by  means  of  our  Branch  Linc.</span></p> <p><span>  Peak  Dotmu  Adwriher.</span></p> ",Article,1878-12-24,"The Morning Bulletin, [?] TUESDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1878.",51978366,2,2,"{'score': '6361.4336', 'value': 'very relevant'}","THE progress of Time has brought our lives to another landmark; and, like travellers who have reached an oasis in the desert, it is fitting that we rest awhile","{'id': '77', 'value': 'Morning Bulletin (Rockhampton, Qld. : 1878 - 1954)'}",https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/51978366?searchTerm=%27Morning+Bulletin%27,/newspaper/51978366,"Morning Bulletin (Rockhampton, Qld. : 1878 - 1954)",77

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  DECEMBER  4,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  virulence  of  language  which  prevails</span><span>  in  the  Legislature  of  Victoria  must  be</span><span>  sincerely  deplored  by  every  honorably</span><span>  sensitive  public  man  in  that  colony.  At</span><span>  first  sight  one  might  suppose  that  nltra</span><span>  deraocratic  institutions  with  payment  of</span><span>  members,  was  responsible  for  this  dis-</span><span>  tasteful  feature  of  Victorian  politics.  But</span><span>  we  fear  that  on  examination  this  theory</span><span>  will  not  be  found  sustainable.  Manhood</span><span>  suffrage  has  half-filled  the  Parliament</span><span>  with  mediocrities  and  nonentities,  but  in</span><span>  these  classes  the  local  preacher  element</span><span>  is  very  strone;,  and  it  admittedly  pro-</span><span>  vides  representatives  whose  character</span><span>  and  demeanour  are  unexceptionable.  It</span><span>  is  on  the  ""  constitutional  ""  side  of  the</span><span>  chamber,  where  the  first  gentlemen  of</span><span>  the  land  in  a  social  and  Intellectual</span></p> <p><span>  aspect  are  presumably  collected,  that  the</span><span>  greatest  breaches  of  propriety  occur.</span><span>  The  same  anomaly  is  noticeable  in</span><span>  the  Press.  The  Argus,  which  wishes  to</span><span>  be  considered  the  leading  journal  of</span><span>  Australia,  habitually  indulges  in  criticisms</span><span>  that  would  lie  discreditable  to  Eatons</span><span>  will,  while  the  Açc,  the  Liberal  organ,</span><span>  though  occasionally  violent,  is  usually</span><span>  not  indecorous  in  its  attacks  upon  public</span><span>  men.  The  wonder  is,  not  that  the  in-</span><span>  flammatory  language  bandied  about</span><span>  lowers  the  tone  of  public  life,  but  that</span><span>  it  does  not  also  impel  resorts  to  physical</span><span>  force.  But  the  fashion  of  the  present</span><span>  age  seems  to  be  for  public  men  to  be</span><span>  energetically  trained  as  public  nuisances,</span><span>  while  they  remain  helplessly  silent  under</span><span>  the  infliction.  And  in  cases  where  the</span><span>  scandal  created  becomes  so  great  as  to</span><span>  force  from  them  an  explanation,  the</span><span>  custom  appears  to  be  to  accuse  them  of</span><span>  the  supprcssio  fifi  as  well  as  the  sttggestio</span><span>  falsi.  It  is  no  wonder,  then,  if  in  the</span><span>  leading  colony  the  wealthy  classes  are</span><span>  beginning  to  evidence  quite  an  American</span><span>  distaste  for  public  life,  and  if  the</span><span>  guardianship  of  public  liberty  is  falling</span><span>  more  and  more  into  the  charge  of  men</span><span>  whose  highest  qualification  for  public  life</span><span>  is  the  possession  of  a  thick  moral  skin,</span><span>  «nd  the  absence  of  that  nice  sense  of</span><span>  honour  which  is  an  indispensable</span><span>  characteristic  of  the  true  gentleman.</span></p> <p><span>  The  proposal  to  dispatch  an  embassy</span><span>  to  England  on  thc  question  of  consti-</span><span>  tutional  reform,  has  provoked  a  succes-</span><span>  sion  of  violent  slanderous  outbursts  both</span><span>  in  the  Parliament  .md  the  Press..  We</span><span>  fully  sympathise  with  those  who  declaim</span><span>  on  the  questionableness  of  thc  project,</span><span>  and  are  ready  to  admit  that  much</span><span>  energetic  denunciation  would  have  been</span></p> <p><span>  -  ??  ?n.al.l«  fmnwv.-AM-£W.\acni^M1  nl-iinit</span></p> <p><span>  point.  But  judging  by  the  reports  the</span><span>  boundary  of  decorum  has  been  repeatedly</span><span>  passed,  especially  by  the  constitu-</span><span>  tionalists,  who  apply  language  to  Mr.</span><span>  Berry  and  his  associates  fit  only  for  the</span><span>  condemnation  of  public  robbers  or  con-</span><span>  spirators  against  the  State.  Whatever  the</span><span>  faults  of  the  Berry  Ministry,  they  cannot</span><span>  justly  be  placed  in  either  of  these  catee</span><span>  gories.  Unquestionably  the  deliberate</span><span>  choice  of  a  free  people  in  the  first  place,</span><span>  they  have  continued  for  years  to  enjoy</span><span>  the  confidence  of  a  large  majority</span><span>  of  the  Legislative  Assembly,  and</span><span>  Mr.  Berry  at  least  seems  to</span><span>  have  learnt  to  bear  himself  with  the</span></p> <p><span>  moderation  and  dignity  becoming  to  bis</span></p> <p><span>  situation.  The  manner  in  which  Sir</span><span>  George  Bowen  has  been  maligned,  too,</span><span>  is  very  much  to  be  deprecated,  although</span><span>  his  lamentable  want  of  moral  courage</span><span>  unquestionably  betrayed  him  into  serious</span><span>  j  mistakes.  Yet,  as  the  representative  of</span></p> <p><span>  Her  Majesty,  he  was  entitled  to  immunity</span><span>  from  violent  and  discourteous  criticism,</span><span>  for  he  was  responsible  for  his  every  act,</span><span>  and  must  have  been  oppressed  with  a</span><span>  keen  consciousness  that  a  single  mistake</span><span>  might  result  in  his  recall  in  disgrace.</span><span>  But  all  this  was  disregarded  by  the</span><span>  constitutional  Press,  which  practically</span><span>  denied  to  the  Governor  any  of  the  con-</span><span>  ventional  ""dignity  that  doth  hedge  a</span><span>  king,""  and  mercilessly  dragged  him</span><span>  before  the  tribunal  of  public  opinion  to</span><span>  condemn  him  without  a  hearing.  For</span></p> <p><span>  none  knew  better  than  these  same  Press</span><span>  writers  that  the  Governor  could  not  enter</span><span>  a  plea  in  self-defence,  and  that  his  lips</span><span>  must  bc  kept  closed  and  his  pen  dry.  But</span><span>  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  Sir  George</span><span>  often  owes  much  to  his  defamers,  and  that,</span><span>  had  his  mistakes  been  temperately  pointed</span><span>  out  fay  men  animated  by  a  spirit  of</span><span>  forbearance  and  strict  sense  of  public</span><span>  duty,  the  close  of  his  turgid  governorship</span><span>  would  scarcely  have  been  marked  by</span><span>  promotion.</span></p> <p><span>  At  this  moment  the  ""black  beast,""</span><span>  in  the  eyes  of  the  Victorian  Press,  is  Sir</span><span>  Charles  Gavan  Duffy,  the  Speaker  of  the</span><span>  Legislative  Assembly,  and  one  of  the</span><span>  trio  intended  to  be  comprised  in  the</span><span>  London  embassy.  It  would  appear  that</span><span>  the  caucus  enters  largely  into  the  parlia-</span><span>  mentary  system  of  Victoria.  Therefore,</span><span>  before  asking  the  Legislative  Assembly</span><span>  to  vote  the  £5000  required  to  defray</span><span>  the  embassy  expenses,  Mr.  Berry  held  a</span><span>  caucus  of  the  Ministerial  members  and</span></p> <p><span>  laid  the  proposal  before  them.  The</span><span>  proceedings  at  caucuses  are  private,  and</span><span>  the  Government  trust  their  secrets  to  the</span><span>  honour  of  the  members  invited.</span><span>  But  there  must  on  this  occasion</span></p> <p><span>  have  been  treachery  in  the  camp,</span><span>  for  next  morning  the  Argus  came</span><span>  out  with  what  purported  to  be  a</span><span>  substantially  correct  account  of  the  pro-</span><span>  ceedings.  Mr.  Berry  was  reported  to</span><span>  have  spoken  in  high  terms  of  the  services</span><span>  rendered  to  him  by  the  Speaker.  Sir</span><span>  Charles  Gavan  Duffy,  he  said,  had  been</span><span>  his  right  hand  man  ;  had  supplied  no</span><span>  end  of  leading  articles  and  letters  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  London  Press  on  the  state  of  Victorian</span></p> <p><span>  affairs  ;  had  drawn  up  all  the  State</span><span>  documents  required  in  the  case  ;  had</span><span>  ""  kept  the  Governor  straight  ;""  and  been</span><span>  the  general  ""emergency  man  ""  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Liberal  party  from  first  to  Inst.  For,</span><span>  and  in  consideration  of  alt  these  services,</span><span>  the  Speaker  was  to  be  appointed-first,</span><span>  one  of  the  ambassadors,  and  then  Agent</span><span>  General  in  succession  to  Sir  A.  Michie.</span><span>  On  this  report  caustic  and  thunderous</span><span>  leading  articles  were  built  no,  and  the</span><span>  whole  colony  rang  with  the  corrupt</span><span>  place-hunting  negotiations  of  the  Premier</span><span>  and  Speaker,  termed  the  latter  a</span><span>  ""  partisan,""  an  ""  intriguing  politician,""</span><span>  the  ""  supreme  mischief-maker,""  the</span><span>  ""inveterate  schemer,""  and  so  forth.</span><span>  Such  epithets  used  in  former  days  would</span><span>  have  brought  the  publisher  to  the  bar  of</span><span>  the  House,  and  deprived  him  of  liberty</span><span>  for  a  considerable  time  ;  but  all  that</span><span>  followed  were  explanations  by  Mr.  Merry</span><span>  and  the  Speaker  which,  apart  from  the</span><span>  strong  political  reason  against  thcappoint</span><span>  ment,  appear  to  have  been  tolerably  ex-</span><span>  culpatory.  Mr.  Berry  explained  that  the</span><span>  Argus  report  was  only  founded  upon</span><span>  fact  ;  that  he  had  testified  to  the</span><span>  usefulness  of  the  Speaker  in  assisting</span><span>  him,  as  leader,  in  the  preparation  of  par-</span><span>  liamentary  documents  ;  and  that  he  had</span><span>  not  credited  the  Speaker  with  pnrtizan</span><span>  services.  Sir  Charles  Duffy  then  fruin</span><span>  the  chair  categorically  denied  every</span><span>  inculpating  statement  in  the  Argus</span><span>  report,  and  declared  that  he  had  never</span><span>  written  an  article  on  the  crisis  for  pub-</span><span>  lication  in  any  English  newspaper.  He</span><span>  emphatically  denied  that  he  had  ever</span><span>  sought  the  appointment  of  one  of  the</span><span>  embassy.  Twice  he  had  distinctly</span><span>  refused  the  offer,  when  made  by  the</span><span>  Chief  Secretary  ;  and  then  and  there  be</span><span>  repealed  that  refusal  for  the  third  and</span><span>  last  lime.  As  lo  his  conduct  through-</span><span>  out  the  crisis,  he  had  merely  put  forth</span><span>  all  his  best  ability,  as  Speaker,  to  con-</span><span>  serve  the  rights  ami  privileges  of  the</span><span>  Assembly,  but  with  rigorous  impartiality</span><span>  as  respects  parties.  There  was  no  denial</span><span>  of  these  assurances,  although  an  honour-</span><span>  able  member  who  was  present  at  the</span><span>  caucus  remarked  that  the  statements  just</span><span>  made  had  destroyed  his  faith  in  public</span><span>  men.  The  Argus,  however,  continued</span><span>  dissatisfied,  and  poured  forth  columns  of</span><span>  abuse  upon  the  unfortunate  Speaker's</span><span>  head.  The  Assembly  afterwards  showed</span><span>  its  opinion  of  the  controversy  by  voting</span><span>  the  embassy  expenses  by  a  large</span><span>  majority,  and  it  is  now  finally  decided</span><span>  that  Mr.  Berry,  accompanied  by  Professor</span><span>  Pearson,  shall  go  home  during  the  recess,</span><span>  and  represent  the  grievances  of  the</span><span>  colonists  to  the  Imperial  Government.</span></p> <p><span>  Tlie  blunders  of  Victoria  in  these</span><span>  malters  would  be  of  little  moment  to</span><span>  our  readers  were  it  not  for  the  fact  that</span><span>  we  are  too  plainly  following,  though  as</span><span>  yet  at  a  respectful  distance,  in  the</span><span>  footsteps  of  that  colony.  Our  Press  is</span><span>  less  vituperative  as  a  whole,  and  the</span><span>  greatest  offenders  against  decorum  are</span><span>  those  journals  whose  pretensions  it  is  to</span><span>  be  distinctively  ""  Liberal.""  The  leading</span><span>  journals  in  each  district  of  the  colony  are</span><span>  generally  moderate  in  tone,  and  do  not</span><span>  habitually  and  intentionally  misrepresent</span><span>  the  actions  and  motives  of  public  men.</span><span>  But  in  the  last  parliament  there  were  far</span><span>  too  much  brusqueness  and  mischievous</span><span>  .  mas  diming  certain  members  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Opposition  party,  who,  as  representing</span></p> <p><span>  the  more  substantial  interests  of  the</span><span>  colony,  should  have  been  patterns</span><span>  of  propriety.  It  may  be  hoped  that</span><span>  this  feature  will  not  be  promi-</span><span>  nent  in  the  new  House,  and</span><span>  that  honorable  members  who  claim</span></p> <p><span>  mental  and  social  superiority  will  rarely</span><span>  overstep  the  bounds  of  decorum.  The</span><span>  only  claim  Conservatism  has  lo  pro-</span><span>  longed  existence  is  its  assumed  superior</span><span>  intelligence  as  compared  with  Liberal-</span><span>  ism,  and  if  its  exponents  forfeit  that</span><span>  claim  by  unparliamentary  conduct,  the</span><span>  gradual  extirpation  of  the  party  will</span><span>  surely  follow.  It  will  fall  into  such  ill</span><span>  odour  that  educated  men  of  refined  sen-</span><span>  sibilities  will  be  driven  into  retirement,</span><span>  and  the  public  affairs  will  fall  into  the</span><span>  hands  of  violent  factions  instead  of  being</span><span>  legitimately  constitutional  by  high-toned</span><span>  party  organisations.</span></p> <p><span>  A  COMMITTEE  meeting  in  connection  with</span><span>  the  North  Kockbaniptou  Annual  Christmas</span><span>  Paces,  will  he  held  this  evening,  at  7'30,  at</span><span>  Flynn's  European  Hotel.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  ordinary  monthly  meeting  of  the  Com-</span><span>  mittee  of  the  Benevolent  Society  viii  bc  held</span><span>  this  afternoon,  at  half-past  four  o'clock,  iu  thc</span><span>  committee-room  of  the  School  of  Arts.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court  yestorday  thorc  were</span><span>  no  cases  for  hearing,  the  charge  sheet  being  a</span><span>  clean  one  for  a  wonder,  as  on  summons  day</span><span>  there  arc  genorally  some  matters  requiring</span><span>  the  attention  of  the  Bench.</span></p> <p><span>  Mn.

There  was  a  very  fair  atten-</span><span>  dance.  Mr.  L.  Sandel  was  called  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  chair,  and  having  read  the  advertisement</span><span>  convening  the  meeting,  called  on  Mr.</span><span>  J.  J.  Johnson,  who  would  give  information  as</span><span>  to  the  objects  for  which  they  wcro  wet.  Mr.</span><span>  Johnson,  after  speaking  nt  some  length  on  the</span><span>  general  subject  of  the  strike,  moved  that  a</span><span>  committee  be  appointed  to  seo  to  the  proper  dis.</span><span>  tribution  of  tho  money  amongst  hom  fide  sea-</span><span>  men  and  wharfmcn  on  strike.  Ha  thought,</span><span>  alBO,  it  would  be  advisable  to  appoint  a  com-</span><span>  mittee  from  themselves.  Mr.  Miller  seconded</span><span>  the  motion,  and  strongly  condemned  the  action</span><span>  of  tho  men  who  engaged  to  man  the</span><span>  Tinonee,  having  Bignell  articles  for  £8</span><span>  a-month  instead  of  £8  10s.,  the  usual</span><span>  rate  of  wages.  Mr.  Hale  supported  thc</span><span>  proposition,  which,  on  being  put,  was  carried</span><span>  amidst  applause.  He  strongly  advised  the</span><span>  men  on  strike  on  no  account  to  infringe  the</span><span>  law.  In  pursuance  with  the  previous  resolu-</span><span>  tion,  the  following  committee  were  chosen  :</span><span>  Messrs.  Joseph  lillis,  Hale,  G.  Brodie,  and</span><span>  John  Lalor.

There  was  a  large</span><span>  «ttonnW-c.  The  Kev.  A.  Hay,  M.A.;</span><span>  was  called  on  to  preside.  When  the  Chair-</span><span>  man  had  stated  tho  object  of  the  meeting,  it</span><span>  was  unanimously  resolved  that  a  society</span><span>  he  formed,  to  bc  called  ""The  Kock</span><span>  hampton  Debating  Society.""  Rules,</span><span>  which  had  been  drawn  up  at  a  pre-</span><span>  liminary  meeting,  were  then  read  tariatim,</span><span>  and  confirmed  or  amended  as  thc  meeting</span><span>  considered  advisable.  The  meetings  are  to  bc</span><span>  held  fortnightly,  on  Thursday  evening,  at</span><span>  oight  o'clock.  The  following;  gentlemen  were</span><span>  chosen  office-bearers  :-President,  Mr.  John</span><span>  Macfarlane  ;  Vice-presidents,  Kev.  A.  Hay</span><span>  mid  Mr.  A.  Fees  ;  Secretary,  Mr.  H.  Salmond  ;</span><span>  Treasurer,  Mr.  S.  \V.  Hartley  ;  Committee,</span><span>  Messrs.  Mackay,  M  ilford,  Ogg,  and  Oliver.</span><span>  Mr.  Mackay  was  entrusted  with  tho  selection</span><span>  of  two  gentlemen  to  act  with  himself,  to  be</span><span>  called  tho  responsible  Committee,  whose  duties</span><span>  shall  he  to  find  subjects  for  discussion.  Tho</span><span>  society  is  to  bc  con  gratulated  in  making  such</span><span>  a  vigorous  beginning,  and  it  is  to  be  hoped</span><span>  that  thc  interest  in  its  proceedings  may  bc</span><span>  sustained  and  increased.  ,1</span></p> <p><span>  N^A  HKKTINU  of  parishioners  was  hold  in  s£</span><span>  Tani's  Church  last  night  for  tho  purpose  of</span><span>  electing  three  gentlemen  to  act  as  nominators.</span><span>  Dr.  Salmond  presided,  and  there  were  sixteen</span><span>  members  of  thc  church  present.  The  Chair-</span><span>  man  introduced  tho  subject  of  thc  meeting,</span><span>  and  explained  that  it  was  the  duty  of  the</span><span>  nominators  to  submit  thc  name  of  a  clergyman</span><span>  to  the  Bishop  fer  approval  when  the  necessity</span><span>  arose  for  the  appointment  of  a  minister.</span><span>  The  nominators  were  usually  elected  at</span><span>  tho  Easter  meetings,  but  circumstances</span><span>  had  arisen  last  Easter  which  prevented</span><span>  the  election  taking  place.  Mr.  Linthwaite</span><span>  said  he  believed  the  appointment  of  a  minister</span><span>  should  be  left  with  thc  Bishop,  who  was</span><span>  better  qualified,  by  his  large  experience  and</span><span>  knowledge  of  their  requirements,  to  select</span><span>  suck  a  gentleman  as  they  required.  Mr.</span><span>  Lucas  explained  that  the  election  of  nominators</span><span>  was  merely  a  primary  step;  the  final</span><span>  uppointnieul  of  a  minister  waa  vested  in</span><span>  thc  Bishop.  Mr.  Livermore  said  that  it  was</span><span>  only  necessary  to  elect  a  third  nominator,  ns</span><span>  he  and  Captain  Hunter  still  held  office.  Mr.</span><span>  Linthwaite  intimated  that  he  was  satisfied  with</span><span>  thc  explanation,  and  therefore  bad  much</span><span>  pleasure  in  proposing  that  Mr.  H.  8.  Martin</span><span>  bo  elected  to  fill  tho  vacant  position.  Mr.  Shaw</span><span>  seconded  the  motiou.  Mr.  Martin  declined</span><span>  thc  honour,  preferring  that  an  older  resident  in</span><span>  thc  parish  should  be  appointed,  and  would  beg</span><span>  to  proposed  that  Dr.  Kalmoud  be  elected.  Mr.</span><span>  Mills  seconded  the  proposition.  Dr.  Salmond</span><span>  was  of  opinion  that  as  Mr.  G.  S.  Lucas  had</span><span>  shown  such  aptitude  for  church  affairs  no</span><span>  better  selection  could  bc  made  than  that</span></p> <p><span>  gentleman,  and  he  would,  whilo  thanking</span><span>  those  gentlemen  who  were  desirous  of  appoint-</span><span>  ing  him,  feel  great  pleasure  in  proposing  Mr.</span><span>  Lucas  as  third  nominator.  Tho  resolution,</span><span>  being  seconded  by  Mr.  A.  T.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  -</span></p> <p><span>  jj  MONDAY,  AUGUST  19,  1878.  p</span></p> <p><span>  WE  nuderstand  that  Captain  Rundle,  Bar-</span><span>  bour  Master,  has  taken  out  a  summons  against</span><span>  the  Town  Clerk  for  causing  the  removal  of  a</span><span>  vessel  from  one  wharf  to  another  and  interfer-</span><span>  ing  with  his  duty  as  Harbour  Master.  It  ap-</span><span>  pears  from  what  we  have  been  able  to  loam  of</span><span>  thoi  matter,  that  Mr.  Davis,  as  wharfinger  for</span><span>  the;Town  Council,  ordered  Captain  Armit,  of</span><span>  thc  Young  Dick,  schooner,  to  moor  Iiis  vessel</span><span>  from  the  Queen's  Wharf  to  make  room  for</span><span>  the;  Clarence,  steamer,  which  had  on  board</span><span>  a  quantity  of  produce  of  a  perishable  nature,</span><span>  and  was  therefore  entitled  to  special  consider</span></p> <p><span>  ation.  He  was  at  the  same  time  informed</span></p> <p><span>  that  he  could  use  thc  adjoining  wharf.  The</span><span>  Young  Dick  had  discharged  her  cargo,  and</span><span>  Captain  Armit,  wc  believe,  made  no  demur</span><span>  to  {thc  order,  but  removed  his  vessel  as</span><span>  desired.  The  Harbour  Master,  however,</span><span>  considers  his  province  has  been  illegally</span><span>  encroached  upon,  and  has  invoked  the  aid  of</span><span>  the  i  local  Bench  of  Magistrates  against</span><span>  the  supposed  intruder.  Assuming  our</span><span>  statement  of  facts  to  be  correct,</span><span>  we  ,arc  at  a  loss  to  know  wherein  the  Town</span><span>  Clerk  bas  improperly  interfered  with  thc</span><span>  duties  of  tba  Harbour  Master.  The  Queen's</span><span>  Wharf  is  under  the  control  and  management</span><span>  of  the  Corporation-we  presume  that  will  not</span><span>  bo  disputed,-and  the  Corporation,  through  its</span><span>  representative,  is  surely  entitled  to  say</span></p> <p><span>  whether  a  vessel  shall  or  shall  not  use  thc</span></p> <p><span>  wharf,  or  for  what  length  of  time  she  shall</span><span>  occupy  it.  Hie  Town  Clerk  has  done  no  more</span><span>  than  this.  He  simply  told  Captain</span><span>  Armit  he  mast  remove  from  Queen's  Wharf,</span><span>  and  was  at  full  liberty  to  occupy  Boag's</span></p> <p><span>  another  wharf  under  the  control  of  the  Cor-</span></p> <p><span>  poration.  The  Harbour  Master's  jurisdiction</span><span>  extends  to  public  wharves,  and,  we  believe,</span><span>  in  exceptional  circumstances,  where  the  pro-</span><span>  per  régulation  of  the  movements  of  shipping</span><span>  in  port  requires  it,  he  bas  statutory  authority</span><span>  to  give  directions  regarding  the  position  of</span><span>  vessels  lying  alongside  private  wharves,  but</span><span>  the  exceptions,  so  far  from  recognising  a</span><span>  powerin  the  Harbour'Master  to  crercjoc  -a</span><span>  general  control  over  private  wharves,</span><span>  seem  rather  to  show  that  such  jurisdiction</span><span>  cannot  legally  be  claimed  as  it  would  encroach</span><span>  upon  privato  rights.  Possibly  Captain  Armit</span><span>  has  committed  an  error  in  moving  hiß  ship</span><span>  without  6rst  notifying  to  tho  Harbour-office</span><span>  biß  intention  to  do  so,  hut  if  he  has,  it  was</span><span>  clearly  unintentional  on  his  part,  and  he</span><span>  alone  is  responsible,  and  the  institution  of  pro-</span><span>  ceedings  against  the  Municipal  Council  was</span><span>  scarcely  called  for.  There  may,  however,  be</span><span>  facts  which  have  not  como  to  our  knowledge,</span><span>  and  we  «ball  watch  the  conduct  of  the  case  with</span><span>  some  cariosity.

The  military</span><span>  occupation  of  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  in</span><span>  terms  of  the  decisions  of  the  Berlin  Congress,</span><span>  has  doubtless  been  undertaken  by  that  Power</span><span>  os  a  precautionary  measure,  but  it  is  never-</span><span>  theless  fraught  with  considerable  danger  to</span><span>  the  Austrian  Empire,  inasmuch  as  it  may  lead</span><span>  to  combined  action  by  the  various  Sclavonic</span><span>  races,  including  those  within  thc  Austrian</span><span>  frontier.  Had  all  opposition  been  promptly</span><span>  suppressed  at  tile  outset,  and  been  mads  to</span><span>  appear  utterly  bopcless,  thc  foreign  occupation</span><span>  would  probably  have  been  submitted  to  as  a</span><span>  necessity  j  but  the  successes  which  have</span><span>  attended  thc  Bosnia  population  in  their</span><span>  encounters  with  thc  Austrian  army  will</span><span>  encourage  them  to  further  acts  of  courage,  and</span><span>  not  improbably  induce  the  neighlwuring</span><span>  provinces  to  make  common  causo  with  them</span><span>  against  the  invader.  It  will  ho  remarked  that,</span><span>  although  tho  provinces  in  question  form  part</span><span>  of  Turkey,  thc  Porto  has  not  made  any  armed</span><span>  resistance,  and  bas  simply  demanded  that  tho</span><span>  term  of  Austrian  occupation  shall  not  bc</span><span>  indefinite.  It  is,  however,  thc  Sclav  popula-</span><span>  tion  in  those  provinces  by  whom  the</span><span>  Austrians  find  themselves  stoutly  confronted,</span><span>  and  from  whom  they  have  been  some  days  in</span></p> <p><span>  retreat.</span></p> <p><span>  MISTAKEN  IDENTITY.-The  Toowoonan</span></p> <p><span>  Chronicle  says  :-On  Wednesday  morning  (7th</span><span>  instant)  whilo  tho  president  and  members  of</span><span>  the  committee  were  awaiting  the  arrival  of  his</span><span>  Excellency  Sir  Arthur  Kennedy,  a  carriage</span><span>  appoared  in  the  distance  very  much</span><span>  resembling  that  of  the  Governor.

"<p><span>  j  ROC  IC  HAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  DECEMBER  30,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  accordance  with  arrangements  for</span><span>  some  time  past  planned  by  thc  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  and  for  which  a  vote  was  taken</span><span>  during  the  last  session  of  Parliament,  a</span><span>  number  of  new  meteorological  stations</span><span>  are  about  to  be  established  in  this</span><span>  colony,  while  some  of  those  already  in</span><span>  existence  are  to  be  carried  on  in  a  more</span><span>  elaborate  manner  than  hitherto,  and  with</span><span>  improved  appliances.  The  placestowhich</span></p> <p><span>  these  new  arrangements  apply  are  twenty-  I</span><span>  eight  in  all-four  being  made  first-class  j</span><span>  stations  ;  eight,  second-class  ;  and  six-  j</span></p> <p><span>  teen  third-class.  The  new  first-class</span><span>  stations  will  be  Rockhampton,  Towns-</span><span>  ville,  Cooktown,  and  Thursday  Island.</span><span>  The  second-class  -  Blackall,  Bowen</span><span>  Downs,  Bundaberg,  Cairns,  Charters</span><span>  Towers,  Curriwillinghi,  Palmerville,  and</span><span>  Rutherford.  The  third-class  -  Aramac,</span><span>  Chinchilla,  Cunnamulla,  Durah,  Fassi-</span><span>  fern,  Hawkwood,  Inglewood,  Jon-</span><span>  daryan,  Mitchell  Downs,  Nanango,</span><span>  St.  George,  Surat,  Tate,  Teningering,</span><span>  Tewantin,  and  Walsh.  At  the  first-class</span><span>  stations,  the  instruments  used  will  be</span><span>  barometer,  maximum  self-registering</span><span>  shade  thermometer,  minimum  self-re-</span><span>  gistering  shade  thermometer,  hygrometer,</span><span>  solar  radiation  thermometer  in  vacuo,</span><span>  solar  radiation  thermometer  with  ex-</span></p> <p><span>  posed  hull),  minimum  on  grass  ther-</span><span>  mometer,  rain  guage,  and  wind  vane.</span><span>  The  instruments  for  the  second-class</span></p> <p><span>  stations  will  he-maximum  self-register-</span><span>  ing  shade  thermometer,  minimum  self</span><span>  registering  shade  thermometer,  rain</span><span>  guage,  and  wind  vane.  The  third  class</span><span>  will  only  be  supplied  with  rain  guage</span><span>  .  and  wind  vane.</span></p> <p><span>  I  It  is  our  present  purpose  to  deal</span><span>  I  chiefly  with  the  first-class  stations.  The</span><span>  j  only  stations  of  this  order  now  in  exist-</span></p> <p><span>  ence  are  Brisbane,  Cape  Moreton,</span><span>  Toowoomba,  and  Warwick.  The  number</span><span>  is  therefore  to  be  doubled.  The  observa-</span><span>  tions  at  these  stations  arc  recorded  three</span></p> <p><span>  times  a  day,-viz.,  at  9  a.m.,  3  p.m.,</span><span>  and  9  p.m.,-and  are  transmitted</span><span>  at  those  periods  by  telegraph  to  the  mete-</span><span>  orological  observer,  Brisbane,  and  also</span><span>  to  the  Government  astronomer,  Sydney.</span><span>  The  records  are  tolerably  complete,  those</span><span>  of  the  thermometers  showing  the  maxi-</span><span>  mum  and  minimum  temperature,  both</span><span>  in  shade  and  in  sun,  as  also  the  mini-</span><span>  mum  on  grass  ;  and  the  mean  averages</span><span>  per  month  of  the  readings  of  the  several</span><span>  instruments  are  struck,  and  published  in</span><span>  tabular  form.</span></p> <p><span>  The  instruments  having  arrived  from</span><span>  England,  Mr.  E.  MacDonnell,  Govern-</span><span>  ment  Meteorological  Observer  at  Bris-</span><span>  bane,  has  visited  three  of  the  new  first</span><span>  class  stations;  vit.,  Cooktown,  Towns-</span><span>  ville,  and  Rockhampton;  and  given</span><span>  directions  to  the  respective  telegraph</span><span>  masters  for  placing  the  instruments  in</span><span>  position  and  Liking  the  observations.  It</span><span>  may  be  hoped  thateverythtng  «¡ll  beready</span><span>  to  permit  of  the  new  arrangements</span><span>  taking  effect  not  later  than  Wednesday</span><span>  next  (New  Year's  Day)  in  order</span><span>  that  complete  returns  may  be</span><span>  obtained  for  the  year  1879.  As  re-</span><span>  gards  the  other  stations  of  this  class</span><span>  (Thursday  Island),  ive  presume  that</span><span>  instructions  have  been  sent  there  by</span><span>  mail,  so  that  the  resident  official</span><span>  entrusted  with  the  duty  of  recording</span><span>  observations  may  make  a  commence-</span><span>  ment  at  the  same  time  as  the  others.</span></p> <p><span>  The  instruments  with  which  the  new</span><span>  stations  are  supplied  are  said  to  be  of  a</span><span>  very  superior  kind,  and  the  cost  to  the</span><span>  country  of  procuring  them  in  the  first</span><span>  place,  and  of  subsequently  turning  them</span><span>  to  account,  will  make  up  a  considerable</span><span>  amount  annually.  If,  however,  the  work</span><span>  be  carried  out  in  a  thorough  and  reliable</span><span>  manner,  the  cost  will  be  far  more  than</span><span>  compensated  for  by  the  advantages</span><span>  obtained.  The  squatter  and  farmer  will</span><span>  be  placed  in  possession  of  information</span><span>  of  annually  increasing  value  relative  to</span><span>  the  character  and  peculiarities  of  the</span><span>  climate  in  which  they  pursue  their</span></p> <p><span>  avocations,  and  will  thus  be  en-</span><span>  abled  to  direct  their  energies</span><span>  into  such  channels  as  will  secure</span><span>  the  most  remunerative  return.  The</span><span>  shipmaster  will  also  be  immensely  bene</span><span>  fitted  by  being  forewarned  of  storms  and</span><span>  placed  in  possession  of  information  such</span><span>  as  will  often  enable  him  to  secure  the</span></p> <p><span>  safety  of  his  vessel  as  well  as  the  lives</span><span>  and  property  committed  to  his  care.</span><span>  Butthe  observations,  to  be  of  much  value,</span><span>  will  not  only  require  to  be  recorded</span><span>  regularly  and  accurately  j  they  must  be</span><span>  taken  on  some  general  plan-the  instru-</span><span>  ments  being  placed  iu  positions  where</span><span>  they  will  register  correctly  the  infor-</span><span>  mation  desired,  and  care  being  also</span><span>  taken,  that  the  conditions  as  to  distance</span><span>  from  the  ground,  description  of  building,</span><span>  and  other  influences  affecting  the  locality</span><span>  in  which  they  are  placed,  are  as  nearly</span><span>  as  possible  the  same  at  all  the  stations.</span></p> <p><span>  Now,  it  is  in  these  particulars  that  we  j</span><span>  I  have  some  cause  to  apprehend  that</span></p> <p><span>  sufficient  atteanoa  is  not  being</span></p> <p><span>  paid.  Mr.  MacDonnell  has  doubtless  been  j</span><span>  compelled  to  make  his  arrangements</span><span>  accord  as  nearly  as  possible  with  the</span><span>  means  placed  at  his  disposal  by  the</span><span>  Government.  What  those  means  are  we</span><span>  cannot  say.  But  wc  find  that  the  new</span><span>  instruments  supplied  to  Rockhampton</span><span>  are  not  to  be  placed  in  positions  which</span><span>  will  enable  them  to  do  their  work  in  a</span><span>  really  satisfactory  manner.  We  have</span><span>  repeatedly  complained  of  the  situation</span><span>  of  the  old  rain  gauge-at  the  rear  of  the</span><span>  Post  and  Telegraph  Offices,-that  block</span><span>  of  buildings  standing  between  the  gauge</span><span>  and  the  direction  of  the  prevailing  rains.</span><span>  The  locality  decided  upon  by  Mr.  Mac-</span><span>  Donnell  for  the  new  rain  gauge  is</span><span>  a  few  feet  inside  the  fence  enclosing</span><span>  the  police  barracks  in  Denham</span><span>  street-where  it  will  be  fairly  ex-</span><span>  posed  to  the  rains  from  the  south-east,</span><span>  excepting  so  far  as  the  fence  may  pos-</span><span>  sibly  offer  an  obstruction  ;  but  the  police</span></p> <p><span>  barracks  will-  sensibly  lessen  the  force  of</span><span>  winds  from  the  north-west,  and  therefore</span><span>  in  some  degree  affect  the  rainfall  regis-</span><span>  tered  by  the  new  gauge.  It  will  pro-</span><span>  bably  be  answered,  that  these  influences</span><span>  will  only  produce  an  inconsiderable</span><span>  effect  on  the  registrations,  but  mere  off-</span></p> <p><span>  hand  assurances  of  this  kind  are  not</span></p> <p><span>  sufficient,  and  we  should  certainly  feel</span><span>  more  satisfied  if  greater  accuracy  were</span><span>  shown  in  these  matters  of  detail.</span><span>  Anoiher  thing,  and  one  of  some  impor-</span><span>  tance,  is  the  distance  of  the  rain-gauge</span><span>  from  the  ground.  The  old  gauge  is</span><span>  some  six  or  eight  feet  above  the  ground  ;</span><span>  the  new  one  is  to  bc  close  to  the  ground,</span><span>  how  close  we  are  not  informed.  But  the</span><span>  distance  -  whether  one,  two,  three,</span><span>  or  six  feet  -  is  material,  as  the</span><span>  rainfall  will  vary,  more  or  less,  accord-</span><span>  ingly.  Then,  again,  a  similar  ne-</span><span>  giert  of  surrounding  conditions  is</span><span>  evident  in  the  positions  to  which  the</span><span>  i  barometers,  thermomettrs,  and  other</span></p> <p><span>  instruments  are  assigned.  They  are</span><span>  being  hung  in  the  hack  verandah  of  the</span><span>  Telegraph  Office,  near  a  brick  wall,</span><span>  which  at  times  becomes  much  heated,</span><span>  especially  as  the  afiernoin  sun  shines  on</span><span>  the  verandah.  The  bric  ks,  it  should  be</span><span>  noted,  not  only  become  heated  by  day,</span><span>  but  retain  the  heat  for  many  hours  after</span><span>  Ihe  sun  has  gone.  We  need  hardly  say</span><span>  that  such  a  place  as  this  is  not  a  proper</span></p> <p><span>  one  in  which  to  take  observations  either</span><span>  of  the  temperature  or  humidity  of  the</span><span>  air.  Mr.  MacDonnell  will  doubtless  say</span><span>  he  had  to  make  the  best  of  circum-</span><span>  stances,  and  that  he  is  satisfied  of  brin;</span><span>  able  to  obtain  results  fairly  approxim  i</span><span>  ting  to  the  truth  We  cannot,  however,</span><span>  share  his  confidence.  Meteorological</span><span>  observations,  in  so  far  as  they  are  inac-</span><span>  curate,  are  misleading,  and  unless  more</span><span>  than  common  care  is  taken,  their</span><span>  value  will  be  greatly  impaired,  if</span><span>  not  completely  destroyed.  It  is  even</span><span>  possible  that  inattention  to  details  of</span><span>  the  kind  referred  to  may  make  the</span></p> <p><span>  returns  even  worse  than  useless.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  that</span></p> <p><span>  greater  accuracy  has  been  shown  in</span><span>  placing  the  instruments  at  Cooktown  or</span><span>  Townsville  than  herc,  as  thc  con-</span><span>  veniences  at  those  stations  are  not</span></p> <p><span>  likely  to  be  greater  than  at  Rockhamp-</span></p> <p><span>  ton.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  further  important  that  records  in</span><span>  this  colony  should  be  taken  under</span></p> <p><span>  similar  conditions  to  those  in  the  other</span><span>  colonies  of  Australasia,  as  well  as,  if</span><span>  practicable,  at  leading  stations  in  other</span><span>  parts  of  the  world.  In  Australia,  at  all</span><span>  events,  some  general  plan  should  be</span><span>  adopted,  more  especially  as  thc  value</span><span>  of  meteorological  records  depends</span><span>  largely  upon  their  embracing  within</span><span>  their  range  a  sufficient  area  to  enable  the</span><span>  scientific  student  to  trace  out  not  only</span><span>  local  influences  but  those  which  in  a</span><span>  more  general  way  help  to  determine  the</span><span>  character  of  the  climate.  The  data</span><span>  should  be  as  accurate  as  possible,  and</span><span>  would  then  be  of  immense  value  if</span><span>  placed  in  the  hands  of  a  scientific  man</span><span>  who  knew  how  to  use  them.  This</span></p> <p><span>  reminds  us  of  a  very  good  suggestion</span><span>  made  some  time  ago  by  the  Courier,  that</span><span>  a  central  observatory  for  meteorological</span><span>  purposes  should  be  founded  in  Australia</span><span>  at  the  joint  expense  of  the  Colonial</span><span>  Governments,  and  that  the  whole  of  the</span><span>  meteorological  stations  of  these  colonies</span><span>  should  be  under  one  authority,  and  con-</span><span>  ducted  upon  a  uniform  system.</span></p> <p><span>  TIIEHE  were  no  cases  for  hearing  at  thc</span><span>  Police  Court  ou  Saturday,  the  police  sheet</span><span>  being  a  clean  one.</span></p> <p><span>  OWINI;  to  the  inclemency  of  tho  weather,</span><span>  which  luis  interrupted  communication,  our</span><span>  usual  late  telegrams  have  not  come  to  hand.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  following  Justices  are  set  down  for</span><span>  attendance  nt  thc  Police  Court  to-day  and  to-</span><span>  morrow  according  to  the  present  roster.

Mr.  Thorn  performed  several</span><span>  new  tricks  in  a  remarkably  clever  manner,</span><span>  the  most  prominent  being  that  of  the</span><span>  ""inexhaustible  bottle.""  Though  this  is  an</span><span>  old  illusion,  it  is  to  most  persons  not  thc  less</span><span>  astonishing.  The  performer  from  a  plain  glass</span><span>  decanter  filled  nearly  a  dozen  glosses  with</span><span>  various  kinds  of  wine,  including  champado,</span><span>  and  even  produced  milk  and  ink.  As  thc</span><span>  different  liquids  vere  poured  out,  Mr.  Thorn</span><span>  was  loudly  applauded.  Numerous  card</span><span>  tricks  were  also  given,  his  ambidextrous</span><span>  management  of  them  eliciting  frequently</span><span>  repeated  applause.  The  Bocond  part</span><span>  nf  thc  programme  comprised  one  of  thc</span><span>  most  perfect  and  novel  illusions  of  legerde-</span><span>  main.  It  was  invented  hy  Mr.  Thorn,  and</span><span>  Rockhampton  is  the  first  place  where  it  has</span><span>  been  publicly  represented.  On  a  stand  resting</span><span>  on  a  small  table  is  seen  thc  living  body  of  a</span><span>  man,  ""  Abdul  Mirza  Khan,""  visible  from  the</span><span>  stomach  upwards,  but  the  lower  part  ot  the</span><span>  hedy  being  nowhere  apparent.

The  following  biographical  notice  is</span><span>  from  Men  of  UK  Tim;  :-""  Cullen,  His  Emi-</span><span>  nence  Cardinal  Poul,  Catholic  Archbishop  of</span><span>  Dublin,  bom  in  Ireland,  about  1800,  left  his</span><span>  native  country  at  an  early  aga  to  study  in</span><span>  Rome,  whore  ho  remained  thirty  years,  dur-</span><span>  ing  a  considerable  portion  of  which  he  was</span><span>  Rector  of  the  Irish  Collogo,  and  mombcr  of</span><span>  several  ecclesiastical  congregations  i»  that</span><span>  -«.yv-iue  tteatti  oTDr.  Crolly,  Hornau  Cath-</span><span>  olic  archbishop  of  Armagh,  which  took  place</span><span>  in  1849,  was  followed  by  a  difference  of</span><span>  opinion  amongst  the  Irish  suffragans  as  to  thc</span><span>  nomination  of  his  successor.  Many  of  the</span><span>  Irish  bishops  having  suggested  the  name  of</span><span>  Dr.  Cullen,  he  received,  at  the  hands  of  Pius</span><span>  IX.,  his  appointment  to  Armagh,  was  conse-</span><span>  crated  'Primate  of  all  Ireland'in  1850,  and</span><span>  was  transferred  thence  to  Dublin  in  thc  fol-</span><span>  lowing  year,  on  thc  death  of  Dr.  Murray.</span><span>  He  is  strongly  opposed  to  tho  mixed  system</span><span>  of  education  represented  by  government</span><span>  schools  and  Queen's  colleges,  and  as  he  was  one</span><span>  of  the  first  to  conceive  tho  idea  of  a  Catholic</span><span>  University  in  Dublin,  so  he  has  ever  proved</span><span>  himself  a  patron  of  that  institution  and  thc</span><span>  main  pillar  of  its  support  in  Ireland.  He  was</span><span>  proclaimed  Cardinal  in  June,  1806,  being  the</span><span>  first  Irish  bishop  who  since  thc  era  of  thc</span><span>  Reformation  hos  been  advanced  to  that</span><span>  dignity.""</span></p> <p><span>  A  MEETtN-o  of  thc  Trustees  of  the  Grammar</span></p> <p><span>  School  was  held  on  Saturday  forenoon,  at</span><span>  eleven  o'clock.  The  following  gentlemen</span><span>  were  present  :-Messrs.  J.  Macfarlane,  H.  W.</span><span>  Risien,  W.  G.  Jackson,  Rev.  A.  Hay,  and  Dr.</span><span>  Callaghan.  Mr.  Macfarlane  was  called  to  the</span><span>  chair,  and  said  thc  business  of  thc  meeting</span><span>  was  to  fix  the  site  for  the  proposed  Grammar</span><span>  School.  Dr.  Callaghan  thought  it  would  be</span><span>  advisable  to  proceed  with  the  business,  as</span><span>  there  was  a  good  deal  of  dissatisfaction  that</span><span>  moro  rapid  progress  was  not  being  made  with</span><span>  regard  to  the  erection  of  the  school.</span><span>  Mr.  Hay  thought  it  would  be  advis-</span><span>  able  to  adjourn  tho  meeting  for  a</span><span>  fortnight  or  three  weeks,  .md  appoint  a  sub-</span><span>  committee  to  report  to  thc  Trustees  the  areas</span><span>  disposable,  the  sites,  and  the  prices  at  which</span><span>  they  might  be  obtained.  But  there  was</span><span>  another  and  insuperable  objection  to  their</span><span>  fixing  tho  site  to-day!:  the  absence  of  two  of</span><span>  the  Trustees,  one  of  whom  could  notattond,</span></p> <p><span>  and  the  other  not  having  received  notice  of</span><span>  the  present  meeting.  Before  choosing  thc</span><span>  site  it  might  also  bc  advisable  to  call  a</span><span>  meeting  of  the  subscribers,  to  ascertain  thc</span><span>  prevailing  feeling  on  thc  subject,  but  not  that</span><span>  thc  action  of  the  Trustees  should  bc  absolutely</span><span>  determined  by  that  meeting.  This,  however,</span><span>  was  only  a  suggestion.  He  moved</span><span>  that  thc  present  meeting  ho  adjourned</span><span>  till  Thursday,  the  21st  instant,  at  four</span><span>  o'clock.  For  thc  reasons  adduced  Dr.</span><span>  Callaghan  withdrew  his  desire  lo  proceed  with</span><span>  the  immediate  selection  of  thc  Bite,  and</span><span>  Bccondod  Mr.  Hay's  proposition.  The  Chair-</span><span>  man  also  expressed  himself  strongly  in  favour</span><span>  of  adjourning  thc  meeting  till  arter  the  elec-</span><span>  tions.  Mr.  Hay's  motion  was  put  and  carried.</span><span>  With  regard  to  thc  suggestion  to  hold</span><span>  a  meeting  of  subscribers,  the  general  feeling</span><span>  seemed  to  bo  averse  to  it,  as  thc  onm  of  choice</span><span>  now  rested  with  thc  Trustees  and  must  bc</span><span>  exercised  by  them.  It  was  also  considered</span><span>  unnecessary  to  appoint  a  sub-committee,  as</span><span>  thc  matters  referred  to  had  been  so  frequently</span><span>  considered  that  there  was  no  advantage  likely</span><span>  to  accrue  from  tho  projiosal.  Mr.  Risien  gave</span><span>  notico  of  a  motion  he  would  bring  forward  at</span><span>  next  meeting  :-""  That  thc  Trustees  apply  to</span><span>  thc  Government  for  tile  reserve  bounded  by</span><span>  Archer-street,  Cambridge-street,  Alma-street,</span><span>  and  Denham-street,  for  tho  purpose  nf  a  Boys'</span><span>  Grammar  School,  and  for  allotments  2,  3,  mid</span><span>  4  of  section  24  .for  thc  purpose  of  a  (Uris'</span><span>  School.""

He  went  on</span><span>  his  journey  alone,  and  was  never  seen  after-</span><span>  wards.  Thc  usual  theories  were  started  in  thc</span><span>  district  to  account  for  his  disappearance,  the</span><span>  one  that  found  most  favor  being,  apparently,</span><span>  that  he  had  been  murdered  by  thc  blacks.</span><span>  This  impression  was  recently  strengthened,  if</span><span>  not  confirmed,  by  thc  finding  of  a  rug,</span><span>  identified  as  Greensmith's  property,  in  a</span><span>  black's  camp  not  far  from  thc  supposed</span><span>  locality  of  the  murder;  and  there  appeared</span><span>  c*«iry  likelihood  of  thc  supposed  muderers</span><span>  being  made  to  feel  thc  heavy  hand  of  the</span><span>  neighbouring  settlors'  retribution.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  OCTOBER  24,  1878,</span></p> <p><span>  IN  contesting  a  general  election  Ministers</span><span>  are  assisted  by  powerful  influences,</span><span>  and  at  the  same  time  hampered  by</span><span>  obvious  disadvantages.  Endowed  with</span><span>  executive  power,  as  well  as  with  the  sole</span><span>  responsibility  of  initiating  all  important</span><span>  legislative  measures,  they  speak  with  an</span><span>  authority  which  the  utterances  of  no</span><span>  Opposition  candidate  command  ;  but</span><span>  they  are  expected  to  disclose  a  policy</span><span>  of  their  own,  instead  of  merely  criticising</span><span>  that  of  their  opponents.  The  Ministers'</span><span>  ideas,  too,  must  be  constructive  ;  while</span><span>  those  of  the  independent  candidate  may</span><span>  be  little  more  than  repellent.  The</span><span>  separate  deliverances  of  the  members  of</span><span>  a  Cabinet  must  also  be  harmonious  and</span><span>  concordant,  at  least  on  all  prominent</span><span>  questions  ;  while  a  certain  amount  of</span><span>  latitude  may  be  claimed  by  and  is</span><span>  always  allowed  to  unofficial  candidates.</span><span>  The  embarrassments  of  office  appear  to</span><span>  be  keenly  felt  by  the  Douglas  Ministry,</span><span>  and  their  recently  delivered  speeches</span><span>  prove  that  they  have  begun  the  elec-</span><span>  tioneering  campaign  under  difficulties  of</span><span>  no  ordinary  kind.  We  have  already  com-</span><span>  mented  on  the  attitude  assumed  by  the</span><span>  Colonial  Treasurer  before  his  Enoggera</span><span>  constituents.  Reports  of  the  speeches  of</span><span>  three  other  Ministers  are  now  before  us,</span><span>  and  it  becomes  our  dutv  to  submit  them</span></p> <p><span>  to  impartial  examination.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Premier  had  a  good  reception  at</span><span>  Maryborough,  and  after  delivering  a</span><span>  carefully  studied  speech  received  a</span><span>  unanimous  and  hearty  vote  of  confi-</span><span>  dence.  His  return  may  therefore  be</span><span>  regarded  as  certain,  and  in  that  light  his</span><span>  utterances  are  invested  with  special</span><span>  importance.  The  policy  he  avows  is</span><span>  not  that  of  Mr.  Douglas  merely,  hut  that</span><span>  of  the  Ministry  which  will  meet  the  new</span><span>  Parliament  in  January.  So  far  as  Mary-</span><span>  borough  is  concerned  his  speecli  has</span><span>  had  its  intended  effect,  but  its  influence</span><span>  upon  the  contest  in  other  electorates,</span><span>  and  possibly  upon  the  future  legislation</span><span>  of  the  colony,  is  a  matter  of  much</span><span>  greater  importance.</span></p> <p><span>  The  early  part  of  Mr.  Douglas'  speech</span><span>  is  devoted  to  a  refutation  of  the</span><span>  statement  of  Mr.  M'Hwraith  at  llunda</span><span>  ,  berg  that  the  Government  had  no</span></p> <p><span>  public  works  policy  when  they  took</span><span>  I  office,  but  were  driven  into  a  policy  by</span></p> <p><span>  the  Opposition,  lie  read  extracts  from</span><span>  one  of  his  own  speeches  delivered  in</span><span>  1875,  at  Maryborough,  in  which  he  had</span><span>  then  pronounced  in  favour  of  a  general</span><span>  expenditure  on  railways  ""  which  lo  some</span></p> <p><span>  economists  may  seem  alarming.  He</span><span>  thought  a  reasonable  scheme  of  railway</span></p> <p><span>  construction  would  involve  an  amount</span><span>  of  something  like  three  and  a  half  millions</span><span>  sterling  during  thc  succeeding  three  or</span><span>  (bur  years.  He  also  reminded  them  of</span><span>  Iiis  approval  of  Mr.  King's  public  works</span><span>  policy,  his  support  of  the  Western  Rail-</span><span>  way  Bill,  and  his  advocacy  of  an  applica-</span><span>  tion  of  that  system  to  other  portions  of</span><span>  the  colony.  We  think  the  speaker  thus</span></p> <p><span>  proved  that  he,  individually,  had  a  railway  1</span><span>  ivilicy  from  the  date  of  his  election  for</span><span>  Maryborough  in  1S75  to  the  lime  of  his</span><span>  accepting  office  in  I87Ú.  And  then  he</span><span>  declares  ""  I  made  it  a  distinct  condition,</span><span>  without  which  Mr.Tliorn'sMinistry  would</span><span>  not  have  been  formed  that  the  principle</span><span>  of  the  Western  Railway  Hill  should  lie</span><span>  enlarged  and  extended  to  other  districts.""</span><span>  Mr.  Douglas  next  vindicated  the  policy</span></p> <p><span>  of  his  Government  on  the  Chinese  and</span></p> <p><span>  Polynesian  questions,  and  explained</span></p> <p><span>  in  reference  to  the  latter  that  he  had</span></p> <p><span>  draftH  ?  v>d  bill,  but  failing  to  secure  the</span><span>  co-operation  of  his  immediate  supporters,</span></p> <p><span>  and  meeting  with  strong  opposition  from  j</span></p> <p><span>  the  other  side  of  the  House,  it  failed  to</span><span>  pass  even  the  second  reading.  In  regard</span><span>  to  the  representation  question,  he  thought</span><span>  a  great  deal  had  been  won,  and  that  the</span><span>  Government  were  entitled  lo  very  great</span><span>  credit  forgetting  increased  representation</span><span>  for  the  outside  districts  at  the  cost  of</span></p> <p><span>  displeasing  their  supporters.  He  de-</span><span>  fended  the  Railway  Reserves  Act,  and</span><span>  said  that  the  amount  received  during  the</span><span>  first  year  under  it  towards  construction</span><span>  was  ,£322,748,  and  he  explained  that</span><span>  if  this  sum,  after  deducting  interest</span><span>  (^120,000)  on  the  total  expenditure  of</span><span>  ¿2,400,000  contemplated  by  that  Act,</span><span>  had  been  placed  to  revenue  account,</span><span>  there  would  have  been  a  large  surplus</span><span>  instead  of  a  prospective  deficit.  He</span><span>  also  contended  that  simply  ns  a  financial</span><span>  operation  involving  financial  security,  the</span><span>  Railway  Reserves  Act  had  proved  effec-</span><span>  tive,  and  there  was  no  reason  why  it</span><span>  should  not  be  adhered  to.  Referring  to</span><span>  the  deficit,  he  said  it  was  simply  cowar-</span><span>  dice  lo  assume  that  thc  returns  of  thc</span></p> <p><span>  first  quarterjwould  be  an  index  of  the</span><span>  whole  3rear.  There  has  been  deficits  in</span><span>  twelve  years  since  Separation,  and  while</span><span>  there  was  a  deficit  of  £51,000  in  1876,</span><span>  tile  next  following  year  showed  a  surplus.</span><span>  There  had,  in  fact,  been  a  surplus  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  last  two  years.  It  was  absurd,  therefore,</span><span>  to  come  to  the  conclusion  that  because</span><span>  in  one  year  there  had  been  a  deficit,  we</span><span>  are  at  once  to  rush  into  a  scheme</span><span>  of  fresh  taxation.  Such  things,  he  re-</span><span>  minded  the  audience,  were  only  put  for-</span><span>  ward  to  injure  the  present  Government.</span><span>  After  contending  for  the  necessity  of</span><span>  maintaining  immigration,  tie  quoted  some</span><span>  statistics  illustrative  of  the  progress  of</span><span>  the  colony  during  the  past  four  years,  and</span><span>  urged  that  the  wise  policy  would  be  to</span><span>  continue  to  increase  the  population,  and</span><span>  provide  abundance  of  land  for  settle-</span></p> <p><span>  ment.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Douglas  then  spoke  at  length  on</span><span>  the  railway  question.  He  believed  the</span><span>  people  of  the  colony  would  demand</span><span>  railway  extensions  both  in  the  interior</span><span>  and  coast  districts  ;  but  ""  how  this  is  to</span><span>  he  done  is  a  financial  problem  that  I  do</span><span>  not  pretend  on  the  present  occasion  lo</span><span>  way  financial  policy  at  this  time.""  He</span><span>  then  went  on  to  say  that  in  his  opinion</span><span>  we  could  not  hope  to  construct  main</span><span>  lines  of  railway  at  less  than  ^5000</span><span>  a-mile,  and  subsidiary  lines  at  ¿4000.</span><span>  He  did  not  believe  railways  that  would</span><span>  stand  wear  and  tear,  and  the  seasons  in</span><span>  our  climate,  could  be  made,  as  some</span><span>  competent  men  asserted,  at  ^3000</span></p> <p><span>  a-mile.

To  have  done  so</span><span>  would  have  engrossed  the  entire  space  at</span><span>  our  command,  but  it  must  not  be  sup-</span><span>  pose  that  we  deem  the  Premier's  fallacies</span><span>  and  misstatements  on  this  subject  of  little</span><span>  moment.  They  are  really  of  paramount</span><span>  importance,  and  we  deplore  the  depth  of</span><span>  error  into  which  the  Premier,  apparently</span><span>  to  catch  votes,  has  been  plunged.  It</span><span>  will  be  remembered  that  about  three</span></p> <p><span>  years  ago  Mr.  King  made  a  speech  at</span><span>  Maryborough  which  we  then  designated</span><span>  ""  incendiary.*'  He  said  ""  the  Western</span><span>  Railway  Act  was  the  thin  end  of  the</span><span>  wedge  that  would  destroy  the  squatting</span><span>  system,""  and  that  the  land  was  to  be</span><span>  sold  at  auction  ""  as  a  bait  to  the  squat-</span><span>  ters  to  induce  them  to  pass  the  bill.""</span><span>  Mr.  King  was  severely  censured  for  this</span><span>  reckless  and  immoral  speech  at  the  time.</span><span>  Il  was  made  under  excitement,  when  he</span><span>  had  been  stung  by  personal  affronts  from</span><span>  squatters  who  had  been  old  friends,  and</span><span>  we  believe  that  to-day  no  one  more</span></p> <p><span>  sincerely  regrets  the  intemperance  of  his  i</span><span>  language  than  Mr.  King  himself  does.</span><span>  But  what  does  Mr.  Douglas  do  ?

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  SEPTEMBER  2,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  reports  brought  by  the  last  mail  from</span><span>  and  of  the  proceedings  of  the  Con-</span></p> <p><span>  a  pretty  good  idea  of  the  decisions</span><span>  arrived  at  as  well  as  some  of  the  reasons</span><span>  which  led  to  those  decisions.  Perhaps</span><span>  the  most  interesting,  at  the  present</span><span>  moment,  is  the  information  relating  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  military  occupation  by  Austria  of</span><span>  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,  as  this  portion</span><span>  of  the  programme  determined  upon  is</span><span>  meeting  with  stout  resistance  from  the</span><span>  inhabitants  of  those  provinces.</span></p> <p><span>  It  appears  that  preliminary  arrange-</span><span>  ments,  such  as  that  entered  into  between</span><span>  Salisbury  and  Schouvaloff  on  behalf  of</span><span>  their  respective  Governments,  were</span><span>  entered  into  by  various  Powers</span><span>  before  the  opening  of  the  Congress,</span><span>  and  that  this  was  done  in  accordance</span></p> <p><span>  with  a  common  understanding  and  with</span><span>  a  view  to  facilitate  an  amicable  settle-</span><span>  ment  of  the  various  difficult  problems</span><span>  demanding  solution.  Indeed,  the  most</span></p> <p><span>  important  questions  would  appear  to</span><span>  have  all  been  treated  in  this  way,  so  that,</span><span>  when  they  came  before  the  Congress,</span><span>  there  remained  little  to  be  done  with  them</span></p> <p><span>  but  to  adopt  resolutions  for  their  formal  J</span></p> <p><span>  ratification.  It  thus  happened  that  the</span><span>  discussion  of  the  Congress  principally</span><span>  related  to  unimportant  questions  and</span><span>  matters  of  detail,  which  were  generally</span><span>  left  in  charge  of  the  subordinate  and  less</span><span>  influential  plenipotentiaries.</span></p> <p><span>  With  regard  to  Bosnia  and  Herze-</span><span>  govina  an  important  discussion  took</span><span>  place,  the  general  tenor  of  which  is</span><span>  published  in  the  Press.  Count  Andrassy</span><span>  opened  the  question  by  reading  a</span><span>  memoire,  which  shows  that  for  a  whole</span><span>  year  Austria  had  been  subject  to  in-</span><span>  cessant  alarms  by  the  insurgent  condition</span><span>  prevailing  on  her  frontiers.  The  agita-</span><span>  tion  in  the  two  provinces  referred  to  had</span><span>  even  extended  to  the  heart  of  the</span><span>  Austrian  Empire,  and  threatened  to</span><span>  result  in  a  general  rising  of  the</span><span>  Sclavonic  races.  No  less  than  150,000</span><span>  Bosnian  refugees,  Count  Andrassy  in-</span><span>  formed  the  Congress,  had  crossed  the</span><span>  frontier  into  Austrian  territory,  and  re-</span><span>  fused  to  return  while  their  country</span><span>  remained  under  the  domination  of</span><span>  Turkey,  which  could  afford  them  neither</span><span>  existence  nor  security;  and  theyprotested</span><span>  that  they  would  prefer  the  misery  and</span><span>  humiliation  of  exile  and  Austrian</span><span>  charity  to  returning  to  their  homes,</span><span>  either  already  devastated  or  threatened</span></p> <p><span>  with  being  so.  Turkey  was  not</span><span>  in  a  position  to  maintain  tran-</span><span>  quillity  in  those  outlying  provinces,</span><span>  and  some  decisive  steps  were  necessary</span></p> <p><span>  to  put  an  end  to  the  prevailing  anarchy.</span><span>  Count  Andrassy,  having  effectively  stated</span><span>  his  case,  concluded  by  saying  that,  he</span><span>  did  not  ask  that  the  provinces  should  be</span><span>  annexed  to  Austria:  he  only  begged</span><span>  the  Congress  to  come  to  some  solution,</span><span>  and  if  this  solution  appeared  to  him</span><span>  practical  and  acceptable,  Austria  would</span></p> <p><span>  be  the  first  to  adhere  to  it.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Marquis  of  Salisbury  followed,</span><span>  declaring  that  England  was  penetrated</span><span>  by  the  justness  of  the  observations  of</span><span>  the  First  Austrian  Plenipotentiary,  and  as</span><span>  his  noble  friend  rejected  public  appro-</span><span>  priation  and  contented  himself  with  left</span><span>  hand  annexation,  he  proposed  that</span><span>  Austria  be  charged  to  occupy  Bosnia  and</span></p> <p><span>  Herzegovina,  and  take  those  provinces</span></p> <p><span>  directly  under  her  protection.  The  in-</span><span>  tervention  of  a  powerful  State  was</span><span>  necessary,  and  the  task  could  only  be</span><span>  undertaken  effectively  by  Austria,</span><span>  which  was  the  immediate  neighbour  of</span><span>  the  disturbed  provinces.  M.  Wadding-</span><span>  ton,  in  the  name  of  France,  cordially  sup-</span><span>  ported  Lord  Salisbury's  proposal.  Prince</span><span>  GortschakoiT  adhered  purely  and  simply</span><span>  to  the  motion,  Germany  kept  silent,</span><span>  and  a  moment  of  suspensi  followed.</span><span>  Al  last  the  Turkish  Plenipotentiary  rose,</span><span>  and  said  Turkey  could  not  possibly  con</span></p> <p><span>  sent  to  the  separation  demanded  of  her.</span><span>  She  was  only  bound  hythe  Treaty  of  San</span><span>  Stefano,  and  the  present  demand  ex-</span><span>  ceeded  the  limits  ol  that  document.</span><span>  Turkey,  he  said,  was  herself  in  a  positioo</span><span>  to  protect  and  administer  Bosnia,  and</span><span>  what  the  Powers  proposed  to  do  for  her,</span></p> <p><span>  she  could  take  in  hand  herself.  But</span><span>  apart  from  the  abstract  merits  of  the</span><span>  question,  the  Turkish  Plenipotentiaries</span><span>  had  formal  instructions  which  forbade</span><span>  their  acquiescence  in  this  concession,</span><span>  and  they  could  not  agree  to  Lord  Salis-</span><span>  bury's  proposal.  Lord  Beaconsfield,</span><span>  at  this  point,  said  that  England  could</span><span>  not  but  adhere  to  the  motion  she  had</span><span>  made.  The  provinces,  if  left  in  the</span><span>  keeping  of  the  Porte,  would  unneces-</span><span>  sarily  tend  to  break  up  the  cohesive</span><span>  state  of  the  Empire  deemed  essential</span><span>  to  her  by  the  friends  of  Turkey  them-</span><span>  selves  and  by  those  who  wished  to  procure</span><span>  a  lasting  peace.  If,  he  said,  Turkey</span><span>  in  the  plentitude  of  her  power  was  not</span><span>  able  to  get  the  better  of  an  insurrection</span><span>  which  had  broken  out  in  Herzegovina,</span><span>  how  was  it  possible  for  Europe  now</span><span>  to  confide  to  her  the  security</span><span>  of  those  provinces?  Prince  Bismarck</span><span>  followed,  expressing  astonishment  that</span></p> <p><span>  the  Turkish  Plenipotentiaries  hesitated</span><span>  to  yield  to  the  unanimous  opinion  of  the</span><span>  Congress.  He  .reminded  them  that  the</span><span>  Congress  by  efforts  which  had  been  un-</span><span>  interrupted,  and  by  incessant  mutual</span><span>  concessions,  had  determined  to  restore</span><span>  to  Turkey  provincesfar  more  considerable</span><span>  than  those  in  question,  and  which  she  had</span><span>  renounced  by  the  Treaty  of  San  Stefano.</span><span>  And  with  regard  to  the  restrictive</span><span>  instructions  referred  to  by  the  Turkish</span><span>  Plenipotentaries,  he  urged  them  to  ask</span><span>  for  new  directions  which  would  permit</span><span>  them  to  give  their  adhesion  to  the  views</span><span>  of  the  Congress.  The  motion  was  then</span><span>  submitted  and  adopted  unanimously  by</span><span>  the  members  of  the  Congress,  except</span><span>  Turkey  and  Austria,  who  refrained  from</span><span>  voting.  Count  Andrassy,  however,</span><span>  afterwards  declared  that  he  accepted  the</span><span>  nroposal  voted  bv  the  Congress.</span></p> <p><span>  Telegrams  subsequently  received  from</span><span>  Constantinople  state  that  Turkey  agrees</span><span>  to  the  Austrian  occupation  of  Bosnia</span><span>  and  Herzegovina,  subject  to  conditions</span><span>  requiring  the  term  of  occupation  to  be</span><span>  fixed,  the  number  of  Austrian  troops</span><span>  limited,  and  the  occupation  restricted  to</span><span>  a  certain  area.  Austria  naturally  refuses</span><span>  to  be  hampered  by  such  conditions,  and</span><span>  has  undertaken  the  occupation  without</span><span>  any  cordial  understanding  with  Turkey</span><span>  in  the  matter.  To  undertake  the  duty</span><span>  imposed  on  her  by  the  Congress  subject</span><span>  to  the  restrictions  insisted  on  by  Turkey</span><span>  ímpossiDie,  task.  Turkey,  however,  still</span><span>  stands  aloof,  and  in  excuse  for  not</span><span>  assisting  to  put  into  execution  the</span><span>  decisions  of  the  Congress,  admits  her</span><span>  inability  to  quell  the  insurrection  now</span><span>  raging  m  Bosnia.  Austria  has  therefore</span><span>  given  notice  that  if  -  Turkey  continues</span><span>  inactive,  the  result  will  be  an  Austrian</span><span>  annexation  of  the  disturbed  provinces  by</span><span>  right  of  conquest.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Austrian  Empire  is  already  tn</span><span>  great  danger  of  falling  to  pieces  owing</span><span>  to  the  diverse  and  conflicting  elements  of</span><span>  which  it  is  composed;  and  further  annexa-</span><span>  tions  might  increase  thatdanger  and  prove</span><span>  a  source  of  weakness  rather  than  strength.</span><span>  But  Austria  has  been  driven  to  a</span><span>  choice  of  evils,  and  has  in  all  proba-</span><span>  bility  adopted  the  safest  and  wisest</span><span>  course  open  to  her.  It  has  been  sug-</span><span>  gested  that  this  step  was  desired  by</span></p> <p><span>  Bismarck,  as  one  not  unlikely  to</span><span>  eventuate  in  the  development  of  a  Pan</span><span>  Slavonic  Kingdom  governed  by  the</span><span>  House  of  Hapsburg  from  Constantinople.</span><span>  This  could  only  be  accomplished  by</span><span>  a  breaking  up  of  the  Austrian</span><span>  Empire,  which  would,  it  is  be-</span><span>  lieved,  have  the  indirect  advantage  of</span><span>  completing  the  work  of  German  unity.</span><span>  We  mention  this  rumour  without  attach-</span><span>  ing  to  it  very  much  importance  ;  but</span><span>  there  can  be  no  question  that  the  position</span><span>  of  Austria  is  extremely  critical,  and  it  is</span><span>  just  possible  that  a  change  of  the  kind</span><span>  indicated  may  come  about  at  no  distant</span></p> <p><span>  date.</span></p> <p><span>  Tiffi  District  Court  sittings  will  close  to-day</span><span>  with  the  hearing  of  thc  appeal  case  of  Plunkett</span><span>  v.

On  inquiry  wc  learn  a  few  particulars</span><span>  from  Sub-Inspector  Collopy,  but  at  present  it</span><span>  is  impossible  to  ascertain  tho  full  facts  of  the</span><span>  case.  The  lapnis  has  been  accelerated  by  Mr.</span><span>  Collopy's  late  absence  in  Brisbane  in  Fuller's</span><span>  case,  but  it  now  transpires  that</span><span>  suspicious  circumstances  occurred  during</span><span>  March  last.  Before  Sub-Inspector's  de-</span><span>  parture  bo  gave  two  cheques  to  O'Sul-</span><span>  livan  ta  pay  tho  wages  of  constables  at</span><span>  two  stations  in  tho  district.  On  the  10th</span><span>  August,  O'Sullivan  telegraphed  to  Mr.</span><span>  rvp^uv-fne^urmiasion  tû_!.o  -Diiabanu  for  a</span><span>  accompanying  Borne  prisoners  who  were  sent</span><span>  down  by  the  lost  trip  of  The  Clarence.  The</span><span>  permission  was  granted,  and  Mr.  Collopy  re-</span><span>  turned  on  the  19th,  and  then  missed  tho  key</span><span>  of  thc  safe  and  telegraphed  to  O'Sullivan  cou</span><span>  cerningit.  Thelatterreplied  that  he  had  it,  and</span><span>  was  coming  back  by  tho  Yaralla,  on  the  21st.</span><span>  The  Yaralla  come,  but  not  O'Sullivan,  when</span><span>  the  telegraph  was  again  called  into  requisition,</span><span>  the  reply  from  Brisbane  being  that  O'Sullivan</span><span>  left  bis  lodging  house  to  go  on  a  boating  trip</span><span>  down  the  river,  but  had  not  yet  returned.  A</span><span>  warrant  was  issued  for  his  apprehension  on</span><span>  Friday  Inst,  but  no  tidings  of  the  wanderer</span><span>  have  yet  been  heard.  It  has  been  noticed</span><span>  that  O'Sullivan  was  living  somewhat  fast</span><span>  lately,  but  great  confidence  was  reposed  in</span><span>  him  by  Mr.  Collopy,  who  only  a  month  or</span><span>  two  ago  recommended  him  for  promotion,  and</span><span>  suspicions  were  not  aroused  until  it  was  too</span><span>  late.  It  is  probable,  however,  that  he  will</span></p> <p><span>  soon  be  arrested.</span></p> <p><span>  THROWING  AWAY  A  LIGITTED  MATCH.</span><span>  Michael  Carroll,  an  old  and  well-known  rcsi</span><span>  deut  of  Dalby,  who  had  been  workiug  for</span><span>  Messrs.

This  unfortunately</span><span>  ignited  tho  dry  leaves  and  reached  deceased,</span><span>  who  was  fearfully  burned  about  the  head  and</span><span>  body  before  ho  could  extricate  himself.

Thc  two  children  are  girls,  and  were</span><span>  boru  on  December  28,  1677,  at  San  Benoit,  a</span><span>  town  about  forty  miles  north  of  Montreal,</span><span>  Canada.  From  their  heads  to  the  first  lumbar</span><span>  vcrtibrae,  the  children  are  possessed  of  per*</span><span>  fectly  formed  and  entirely  distinct  members,</span><span>  but  below  that  point  thc  bodies  become  one.</span><span>  There  is  not  the  slightest  deformity  about  any</span><span>  of  their  organs.  They  have  two  distinct</span><span>  sets  of  internal  organs  and  four  arms,  but  only</span><span>  one  abdomen  and  two  legs.  Each  child  con-</span><span>  trols  one  set  of  organs,  bnt  only  one  leg.</span><span>  Piercing  one  leg  with  a  pin  will  produce  signs</span><span>  of  pain  in  the  face  of  one  child  ;  while  the</span><span>  other  will  be  perfectly  free  from  any  sensation.</span><span>  Tiley  do  not  act  in  unison.  When  one  laughs</span><span>  and  plays,  the  other  sleeps  or  cries  from</span><span>  hunger.  Sometimes  they  both  sleep  together,</span><span>  and  when  both  ore  awake  they  have  the</span><span>  greatest  desire  to  play  with  each  other's</span><span>  hands.  Thc  features  are  very  regular,  and</span><span>  the  face  of  each  child  is  very  pretty  for  a</span><span>  baby  only  seven  months  old.  The  limbs  are</span><span>  as  largo  as  those  of  an  ordinary  child.  Where</span><span>  the  two  bodies  grow  into  one  the  bulk  is  not</span><span>  increased,  but  gradually  decreases  into  the</span><span>  usual  size.  They  were  lately  exhibited  to  a</span><span>  number  of  physicians  who  pronounced</span></p> <p><span>  thc  pair  to  ha  ono  of  tho  greatest  freaks  of</span><span>  nature  they  had  ever  seen.  They  thought  the</span><span>  two  bodies  were  merged  into  one  most</span><span>  naturally,  and  believed  tho  children  would</span><span>  live  to  tho  average  age.  Thc  oliildrcn  have</span><span>  been  named  Hose  and  Maria.  Tho  parents  arc</span><span>  Sinn  and  Anne  Drouin,  who  were  born  in  Mar-</span><span>  seilles,  France.  Their  grandparents  are  still</span><span>  living  there.  A  few  years  ago  Mr.  and  Mrs.</span><span>  Drouin  emigrated  to  San  Benoit  and  engaged</span><span>  in  farming.  They  are  both  20  years  old,  the</span><span>  husband  being  four  days  older  than  his  wife.</span><span>  They  have  only  one  other  child,  a  girl  who  is</span><span>  two  years  old,  and  who  enjoys  the  best  of</span><span>  healthand  suffers  froranodeformity.  One  child</span><span>  looks  very  much  Uko  its  mother,  while  the</span><span>  other  bears  a  striking  resemblance  to  the</span><span>  father.

The  piece  proved  to  be  very  rich  ;</span><span>  there  is  gold  in  flakes  and  specks  all  through</span><span>  both  the  bore  hole  and  the  core.  As  the</span><span>  ,  boring  went  on,  the  finer  flakes  of  gold  Te</span></p> <p><span>  leased  by  thedriU  were  forced  up  by  waterpres</span><span>  sure.  The  calculation  of  Mr.  J.  G.  Henry,  who</span><span>  had  the  operation  in  charge,  is  thatthere  was  no</span><span>  waste  ;  all  the  gold  released  was  saved.  The</span><span>  specimen,  as  it  now  stands,  is  an  effective</span><span>  illustration  of  the  value  of  the  diamond  drill</span></p> <p><span>  for  prospecting  purposes.""  The  Telegraplt,</span><span>  referring  to  this  subject,  says  :-""  Mr.  Sachs,</span><span>  of  Townsville,  bas  purchased  one  half  of  the</span><span>  Gilberton  Gold-mining  Company,  now  in  pro-</span><span>  cess  of  formation,  the  largest  diamond  rock</span><span>  drill  shown  at  the  late  Exhibition.  It  is  the</span><span>  intention  of  the  company,  we  believe,  to  use</span><span>  the  machine  for  testing  their  leasehold  ground</span><span>  at  Gilberton.  We  learn,  also,  that  the  Pro-</span><span>  gress  Committee  of  Charters  Towers  and</span><span>  Thornborough  have  both  forwarded  telegrams</span><span>  to  the  Government,  urging  them  to  secure</span><span>  a  drill  for  each  of  the  goldfields  snamed.""</span></p> <p><span>  MINING  ACCIDENTS.--Two  accidents  have</span><span>  occurred  in  7  and  8  South  Monkland  during</span><span>  the  week  which  cannot  be  attributed  to  any</span></p> <p><span>  thing  else  tuan  an  utter  disregard  01  common</span></p> <p><span>  precaution  on  the  part  of  the  men  who  were</span><span>  injured.  The  first  happened  on  Wednesday,</span></p> <p><span>  in  a  winze  from  the  420-feet  level.  It  was</span><span>  well  known  to  the  men  that  the  bottom  of</span><span>  this  winze  was  daily  expected  t»  hole  through</span><span>  to  a  crosscut  taken  in  for  the  express  purpose</span><span>  of  meeting  it  at  the  520-fcet  level,  and  it  was</span><span>  accordingly  customary  for  a  signal  to  be  given</span><span>  when  shots  were  fired  either  in  one  place  or</span><span>  the  other.  On  this  particular  day,  it  appears,</span><span>  that  the  men  in  the  crosscut  drilled  their</span><span>  boles,  and  being  ready  to  fire  gave  the  usual</span><span>  signals  that  they  were  about  to  do  so.  Two</span><span>  mon  were  in  the  winze,  and  one  of  them  im-</span><span>  mediately  ascended  the  ladders  to  get  out  of</span><span>  danger  ;  the  other,  named|Howard,  fancying,</span><span>  no  doubt,  that  he  was  perfectly  safe  where  he</span><span>  was,  simply  took  up  a  slab,  and  held  it  in</span></p> <p><span>  front  of  him.  The  shot  in  the  cross-</span></p> <p><span>  cut  ""exploded,  blew  through  into  the</span><span>  bottom  paid  for  his""""temerityUUoy  '""meet</span></p> <p><span>  ing  with  serious  injuries  to  his  legs  and</span><span>  feet,  the  wonder  being  that  he  escaped  at  all</span><span>  with  his  life.  The  second  accident  took  place</span><span>  on  Thursday.  This  was  also  in  connection</span><span>  with  firing  a  shot.  A  man,  named  O'Grady,</span><span>  put  it  in  and  fired  it.  By  Borne  oversight  or</span><span>  carelessness  in  firing,  the  explosion  took  place</span><span>  before  the  man  was  hardly  any  distance  away.</span><span>  The  result  was  that  he  was  considerably  hurt,</span><span>  though  it  is  believed  not  dangerously,</span><span>  sufficiently  so,  however,  to  be  taken  to  thç</span><span>  hospital.

"<p><span>  THE  MORNING  BULLETIN,</span><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  JANUARY  14,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  not  surprising  that  the  at-</span></p> <p><span>  tention  of  colonists  engaged  in  the</span><span>  pastoral  industry  is  turned  to  the</span><span>  newly  occupied  country  in  Western</span><span>  Queensland,  and  to  the  adjacent  terri-</span><span>  tory  of  South  Australia  beyond  the</span><span>  Queensland  border.  In  the  New</span><span>  South  Wales  and  Victoria,  as  well  as</span><span>  the  Eastern  portions  of  this  colony,</span><span>  squatting  is  rapidly  becoming  a  thing  of</span><span>  the  past  ;  but  the  great  plains  and</span><span>  rolling  downs  of  the  Far  West  promise</span><span>  to  remain  for  many  years  a  squat-</span><span>  ters'  paradise.  The  country  is  so</span><span>  remote  from  port  and  centres  of</span><span>  population  that  it  will  apparently  offer</span><span>  no  attractions  to  the  small  settler  for  the</span><span>  next  quarter  of  a  century.  Yet  it  can</span><span>  be  now  profitably  occupied  by  cattle,  and</span><span>  when  penetrated  by  railways  will  afford</span><span>  remunerative  pasturage  for  sheep.  In</span><span>  former  times  the  argument  was  that</span><span>  sheep-walks  would  never  furnish  profit-</span><span>  able  employment  for  railways  ;  but  that</span><span>  is  now  classed  among  exploded  theories.</span><span>  In  New  South  Wales  it  is  found</span><span>  that  the  farther  the  lines  are</span><span>  pushed  into  the  heart  of  the  country</span><span>  the  better  they  pay  ;  and  the  private</span><span>  capitalists  who  instructed  the  Deni-</span><span>  liquin  and  Moama  line,  which</span><span>  is  solely  dependent  upon  the  traffic  of  a</span><span>  pastoral  district,  have  made  a  very</span><span>  successful  speculation.  The  stockowners</span></p> <p><span>  who  are  pushing  out  into  the  far  West,</span><span>  therefore,  are  doing  so  in  the  full  belief</span><span>  that  ere  many  years  have  passed  their</span><span>  remote  stations  will  be  brought  within</span><span>  two  or  three  days'  reach  of  port  by  rail-</span><span>  way,  and  are  looking  forward  to  a  rich</span><span>  harvest  in  consequence.  We  do  not</span></p> <p><span>  think  they  will  be  disappointed,  for  the</span><span>  most  sceptical  are  now  being  converted</span><span>  to  the  belief  that  a  great  trans-</span><span>  continental  line,  intersected  at  various</span><span>  points  by  lines  leading  to  as  many</span><span>  shipping  ports  on  the  eastern  coast,</span><span>  will  in  a  very  few  years  be</span><span>  an  accomplished  fact.  Wool-growing</span><span>  alone  would  warrant  railway  accom-</span><span>  modation,  but  the  greater  interior  of  the</span><span>  colony  has  undeveloped  resources  which</span><span>  will  certainly  stimulate  new  enterprises.</span><span>  The  mineral  wealth  of  Australia,  as  the</span><span>  Cloncurry  gold  and  copper  deposits</span><span>  prove,  is  not  confined  to  the  coast  ;  and</span><span>  there  is  every  reason  to  believe  that,  rail-</span><span>  way  accommodation  once  provided,  set-</span><span>  tlement  in  various  forms  will  proceed  at</span><span>  a  pace  of  which  at  present  the  most</span><span>  sanguine  can  scarcely  form  any  con-</span><span>  ception.</span></p> <p><span>  The  old  theory  that  the  great</span><span>  interior  is  a  desert,  subject  to  pro-</span><span>  longed  floods  and  droughts,  has  been</span><span>  already  disproved.  But  more  than  that.</span><span>  There  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  the</span><span>  far  west  suffers  less  than  the  intermediate</span></p> <p><span>  districts  from  alternate  flood  and  drought.</span><span>  All  the  great  rivers  of  Western  Queens-</span><span>  land  have  their  sources  north  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  twenty-third  parallel,  and  participate  in</span><span>  the  benefit  of  the  tropical  rains.  This</span></p> <p><span>  is  especially  the  case  with  the  Diaman-</span></p> <p><span>  tina  and  Herbert.  Observation  has</span></p> <p><span>  already  proved  that  even  when  there</span><span>  have  been  no  local  rains,  the</span><span>  low  country  fringing  those  rivers</span><span>  has  been  blessed  with  seasonable</span><span>  moisture.  The  Herbert  River,  for</span><span>  example,  takes  its  rise  on  the  table</span><span>  lands  within  150  miles  of  the  Gulf  of</span><span>  Carpentaria,  and  it  is  flooded  with  great</span><span>  regularity  during  the  wet  season.  This</span><span>  remark  applies  also  to  the  Diamantina</span><span>  and  Thomson,  and  these  who  have  lived</span><span>  longest  in  the  western  country  hold  that,</span><span>  when  assisted  by  artificial  reservoirs,</span><span>  it  will  suffer  far  less  from  drought  than</span><span>  the  Peak  Downs,  Nogoa,  and  Barcoo</span><span>  districts.  Be  that  as  it  may,  very  great</span><span>  confidence  is  undoubtedly  felt  in  the</span><span>  future  of  the  western  country  by  all  who</span><span>  have  seen  it,  and  as  these  are  generally</span></p> <p><span>  men  of  large  Australian  experience</span><span>  their  opinion  is  worth  taking.</span></p> <p><span>  At  any  rate,  they  are  prepared</span><span>  to  back  their  opinion  by  actual</span><span>  occupation,  and  with  reasonable  en-</span><span>  couragement  from  the  authorities  we</span><span>  may  expect  to  see  colonisatiou  go  on</span><span>  in  the  far  West  with  almost  unparalleled</span><span>  rapidity.</span></p> <p><span>  Great  complaints  are  made  by  intend-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  settlers  in  the  west  at  the  difficulty</span><span>  of  obtaining  maps.  So  far  as  the</span><span>  officially  published  maps  go,  the  west  is</span></p> <p><span>  still  a  terra  incognita.  As  a  matter  of</span><span>  fact,  however,  it  is  now  almost  all</span><span>  surveyed.  We  learnt  that  in  the  Mitchell</span><span>  district  no  less  than  700  runs  have  been</span><span>  marked  out,  and  about  1000  in  the  North</span></p> <p><span>  Gregory  district.  Mr.  Surveyor  Jopp  has</span></p> <p><span>  surveyed  the  Herbert,  with  the  Hamilton,</span></p> <p><span>  Burke,  and  other  tributaries.  The  country</span></p> <p><span>  from  Tambo  to  the  Diamantina  was  also</span></p> <p><span>  all  plotted  by  Mr.  Commissioner  Scarr</span><span>  before  his  retirement  from  office,  and</span><span>  there  are  now  in  the  Crown  Lands</span><span>  Office  at  Brisbane  the  materials  for  an</span></p> <p><span>  accurate  map  of  Western  Queensland.</span><span>  Then  why  is  not  such  map  issued  ?</span><span>  Surely  the  pioneers  who  go  out  to  reclaim</span><span>  the  remote  wilderness  are  entitled  to  the</span><span>  information  which  is  thus  buried  in</span></p> <p><span>  official  pigeon-holes.  Such  a  map  is</span><span>  wanted  by  every  station  owner,  and</span></p> <p><span>  would  be  cheerfully  bought  at  a  price</span></p> <p><span>  remunerative  to  the  Government.  At</span></p> <p><span>  present  the  only  resource  is  to  go  to</span><span>  the  Crown  Land  Commissioner's</span></p> <p><span>  office  at  Blackall,  and  there  get</span><span>  a  map  of  the  Mitchell  or  North</span><span>  Gregory,  as  the  case  may  be,  at  a  cost</span><span>  of  seven  or  eight  guineas,  to  say  nothing</span><span>  of  the  time  lost  during  its  preparation.</span><span>  This  impediment  ought  not  to  be  per</span><span>  mitted  to  continue,  and  we  here  invite</span><span>  the  special  attention  if  the  Minister  for</span><span>  Lands  to  the  subject.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  great  want  is  a  survey  of  the</span><span>  south-west  and  western  boundary  of  the</span><span>  colony.  At  present  there  is  the  most</span><span>  hopeless  uncertainty  among  the  owners</span><span>  of  pastoral  country  near  the  border  line.</span><span>  Nobody  knows  the  exact  whereabouts  of</span><span>  the  138th  parallel,  and  yet  the  country</span><span>  in  its  neighbourhood  is  all  rapidly  being</span><span>  occupied.  Surveys  tells  us  that</span><span>  it  is  much  more  difficult  to</span><span>  fix  longitude  than  latitude,  yet  the</span><span>  authorities  differ  widely  as  to  the  latitude</span><span>  of  several  well  known  points.  Mr.  Sur-</span><span>  veyor  Jopp  fixes  the  latitude  of  Cloncurry</span><span>  seventeen  miles  north  of  the  latitude</span><span>  arrived  at  by  Mr.  Kaiser,  of  the  Hodg-</span><span>  kinson  expedition  ;  while  there  is  a</span><span>  difference  of  forty  miles  as  to  the</span><span>  locality  of  Bluff  Station,  which  Mr.</span><span>  Hodgkinson's  journal  fixes  in  South</span><span>  Australia  some  twenty  miles  south  of  our</span><span>  boundary,  while  Mr.  Jopp  brings  it</span><span>  within  the  Queensland  boundary  by  an</span><span>  equal  distance.  Similar  uncertainty</span><span>  prevails  as  to  the  locality  of  the</span><span>  western  boundary,  and  unless  it  be</span><span>  soon  determined  serious  complications</span><span>  are  certain  to  arise,  country  presumedly</span><span>  in  South  Australia  is  being  taken  up  by</span><span>  latitude  and  longitude  in  blocks  com-</span><span>  prising  thousands  of  square  miles,  but</span><span>  the  actual  occupation  of  that  country  is</span><span>  scarcely  possible  until  its  whereabouts  is</span><span>  established.  The  expense  of  running</span><span>  the  line  would  not  be  great,  and  as  the</span><span>  cost  would  be  divided  between  the  two</span><span>  colonies,  there  is  no  reasonable  excuse</span><span>  for  further  delay.  If  energetic  colonists</span><span>  are  willing  to  go  out  and  reclaim  the</span><span>  wilderness,  the  least  the  Government</span><span>  can  do  is  to  assisi  them  in  finding  out</span><span>  the  country  they  are  required  to  pny</span><span>  rent  for.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Customs  collections  at  this  port  for  the</span><span>  week  ending  Saturday  last  amounted  to  £1132</span></p> <p><span>  7s.  7d.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court  on  Saturday  a  stage</span><span>  carrier's  license  was  granted  to  Frank  Sommer,</span><span>  who  intends  to  run  a  coach  between  North</span><span>  Rockhampton  and  Emu  Park.</span></p> <p><span>  TRAVELLERS  from  the  west  inform  us  that</span><span>  Cobb  and  Co.'s  teams  and  coach  between</span></p> <p><span>  Blackwater  and  Springsure  are  not  by  any</span><span>  means  up  to  the  usual  standard  of  efficiency.</span><span>  The  coach  is  an  old  one,  much  addicted  to</span><span>  breaking  down,  which  is  disagreeable  to</span><span>  passengers,  and  the  horses  are  said  not  to  be</span><span>  up  to  their  work.  Were  it  not  for  the  driver,</span><span>  whose  skill  and  patience  are  beyond  praise,</span><span>  we  are  assured  the  coach  would  not  get</span><span>  through  the  trips  at  all.  These  facts  being</span><span>  made  public,  the  manager  will  no  doubt  take</span></p> <p><span>  the  hint.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  season  continues  fine  in  the  far  western</span><span>  interior.  In  portions  of  the  Barcoo  and</span><span>  Thomson  districts  there  have  been  fine</span><span>  thunderstorms,  which  have  made  the  country</span><span>  look  well  ;  but  in  other  parts  rain  is  wanted,</span><span>  although  nowhere  is  the  want  of  grass  or  water</span><span>  yet  felt.  Further  west,  on  the  Herbert  and</span><span>  Diamantina  Rivers,  the  rain  has  been  more</span><span>  general  and  the  country  is  everywhere  like  a</span><span>  barley  field.  There  is  not  much  stock  on  the</span><span>  road  west  just  now,  the  stages  being  too  long</span><span>  to  travel  them  with  comfort,  but  should  the</span><span>  usual  rains  provide  an  abundant  supply  of</span></p> <p><span>  water  there  will  be  much  activity  in  this</span><span>  business.  An  enourmous  area  of  country  has</span><span>  been  taken  up,  and  large  numbers  of  cattle</span><span>  will  be  needed  to  stock  it.  About  2300  head</span><span>  cattle,  the  property  of  Mr.  Brown,  of  Canonbar,</span><span>  N.S.W.,  passed  Blackall  a  few  days  ago.</span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  THERE  was  a  moderate  attendance  at  the</span><span>  performance  of  the  Rockhampton  Blondin</span><span>  on  Saturday  night  last,  though  not  nearly  so</span><span>  large  as  the  entertainment  deserved.  The</span><span>  first  part  of  the  programme  was  similar  to</span><span>  previous  exhibitions,  consisting  of  crossing</span><span>  the  rope  backwards,  with  baskets  on  the</span><span>  performer's  feet,  tricks  with  a  chair,  crossing</span><span>  blindfolded  in  a  sack,  etc.,  all  of  which  were</span><span>  carried  out  adroitly  and  warmly  applauded.</span><span>  After  an  interval,  the  most  exciting  act  of  the</span><span>  evening,  that  of  carrying  a  little  girl  across</span><span>  the  rope,  was  safely  performed.  The  child</span><span>  having  been  firmly  secured  to  the  lad's  back,</span><span>  he  set  out  on  his  perilous  journey  with  all  the</span><span>  case  and  sang  froid  of  an  upcountry  swagman.</span><span>  All  idea  of  danger  or  mishap  is  instantly</span><span>  banished  from  the  mind  of  the  most  nervous,</span><span>  through  the  coolness  and  intrepidity,  and  yet</span><span>  withal  caution,  displayed  by  the  performer.</span><span>  Arriving  safely  at  the  other  platform,  the</span><span>  child  alighted  amidst  enthusiastic  cheering.</span><span>  Although  this  was  presumedly  the  event  of  the</span><span>  night,  Blondin  did  many  other  clever  and</span><span>  laughable  tricks  on  the  rope,  one  of  the  best</span><span>  being  the  ""changing  of  front,""  or  turning</span><span>  around.  This  was  done  with  the  pole  on  his</span><span>  head,  the  turn  being  made  with  ease  and</span><span>  dexterity.  After  appearing  as  a  Chinaman</span><span>  with  the  pole  on  his  back,  he  changed  tn</span><span>  represent  a  monkey,  and  went  through  some</span><span>  fantastic  antics,  to  the  no  small  merriment  of</span><span>  the  audience,  which  brought  the  entertain-</span><span>  ment  to  a  close.  To-night  is  to  be  our  rope-</span><span>  walker's  final  performance,  previous  to  his</span><span>  departure  for  Brisbane  and  the  southern</span><span>  colonies,  and  will  of  course  be  the  last</span><span>  opportunity  Rockhamptonites  will  have  of</span><span>  seeing  le  petit  Blondin.</span></p> <p><span>  A  CRICKET  match  was  played  on  the  North</span><span>  Rockhampton  Cricket  Ground  on  Saturday</span><span>  afternoon,  between  the  Rockhampton  Cricket</span><span>  Club  and  an  eleven  of  the  Good  Templars.</span><span>  The  former  went  to  the  wickets  first  and  put</span><span>  together  34  runs,  none  of  the  batsman  running</span><span>  into  double  figures,  though  Messrs  Martin</span><span>  and  Boldeman  batted  well  for  nine  runs  each.</span><span>  The  Good  Templars  succeeded  in  making</span><span>  seventy-four  runs  with  the  loss  of  nine</span><span>  wickets,  thus  winning  the  match  easily.</span><span>  R.C.C.  1st  Innings  :—T.

DAN  BRIGGS  will  perform  at  the</span><span>  Theatre  Royal  to-night  for  the  benefit  of</span><span>  Eugene  Beda,  the  one-legged  gymnast  and</span><span>  dancer.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  alterations  to  the  Bunyip  are  expected</span><span>  to  be  completed  in  the  course  of  a  week  or  ten</span><span>  days,  and  then  a  trip  to  the  Bay  will  be</span><span>  something  of  a  pleasure.  The  hold-space  has</span></p> <p><span>  been  transformed  into  a  spacious  saloon  26  feet</span><span>  long,  and  there  is  also  a  ladies'  cabin,  or  smaller</span><span>  saloon,  giving  an  additional  space  of  ten  feet.</span><span>  This  will  afford  easy  accommodation  for  twenty</span><span>  passengers.  The  saloons  are  lighted  by  means</span><span>  of  skylights,  and  have  port-light  ventilators.</span><span>  The  fittings  are  of  the  usual  description.</span><span>  The  Company's  wharf  has  also  undergone  some</span><span>  improvement.  Two  additional  jetties,  each</span><span>  twenty  feet  wide  by  six  feet  long,  have  been</span><span>  added  ;  the  old  jetties  have  been  furnished</span><span>  with  new  corner  posts,  while  the  wharf  itself</span><span>  has  been  generally  strngthened.  The  large</span><span>  shed,  which  was  considerably  damaged  by</span><span>  the  great  flood  of  1875,  has  also  been  improved,</span><span>  by  being  raised  and  furnished  with  new  floor-</span><span>  ing.  The  improvement  of  the  wharf  accommoda-</span><span>  tion  has  been  long  required,  and  speaks  well  for</span><span>  the  trade  of  the  port  ;  while  the  transforma-</span><span>  tion  of  the  Bunyip  into  a  comfortable  boat</span><span>  deserves  special  mention,  as  it  supplies  a</span><span>  desideratum,  and  places  the  Company  in  a</span><span>  favourable  light  with  the  travelling  public  in</span><span>  this  quarter.  We  fully  expect  that  the  new</span><span>  saloon,  commodious  for  the  size  of  the  Bunyip,</span><span>  will  tempt  a  few  more  ladies  and  gentlemen</span><span>  to  make  occasional  trips  to  the  Bay,  as  they</span><span>  will  now  be  able  to  do  so  with  pleasure  and</span><span>  a  degree  of  comfort  hitherto  unknown.</span></p> <p><span>  NEWS  reached  town  on  Saturday  that  Davis</span><span>  and  party,  who  have  been  lately  fossicking  in</span><span>  old  abandoned  ground  at  Mount  Wheeler,  had</span><span>  come  upon  quite  a  ""  pot  of  money.""  The</span><span>  statement,  which  we  have  on  the  authority  of</span><span>  a  settler  from  the  immediate  neighbourhood,</span><span>  is,  that  the  party  took  out  three  dishes,  each</span><span>  yielding  twelve  ounces  of  gold.  The  source</span><span>  of  this  lucky  find  is  a  mullocky  and  quartz</span><span>  leader,  situated  about  fifty  yards  from  the</span><span>  spot  where,  some  seven  years  ago,  Caddon</span><span>  unearthed  his  28lb.  nugget.  We  could  neither</span><span>  ascertain  the  depth  of  the  sinking  nor  the</span><span>  width  of  the  leader  ;  but  the  gold  is</span><span>  coarse  and  flat,  and  is  of  the  description</span><span>  called,  in  digger  parlance,  black  gold,  or  gold</span><span>  which  has  not  ""  travelled,  ""  and  is  not  water-</span><span>  worn.  It  is  surmised,  from  this,  that  then</span><span>  may  be  a  good  reef  near  at  hand  ;  yet  the</span><span>  deposit  may  also  turn  out  to  be  patchy,  as</span><span>  hitherto—nobody  can  tell.  But  the  matter  is</span><span>  likely  to  be  tested.  There  are  three  men  in</span><span>  Davis'  party,  Davis  himself  being  an  old</span><span>  digger,  who  was  on  the  ground  about  the  time</span><span>  the  great  nugget  was  found,  and  who  therefor</span><span>  ""  knows  his  way  about.""  Unfortunately,  he</span><span>  and  his  party  have  not  secured  what</span><span>  the  Gold-fields  Act  allows  the  successful</span></p> <p><span>  prospector  as  a  reward  for  his  exertions.  They</span><span>  have  only  three  ordinary  claims,  each  claim</span><span>  measuring  150  feet  by  400  feet,  whereas,  on</span><span>  this  abandoned  ground,  had  they  applied  in</span><span>  time,  they  might  have  secured  three  extended</span><span>  claims,  each  measuring  400  ft.  by  400  ft.,  or  a</span><span>  total  of  1200  ft.  by  400  ft.  Now,  if  our  infor-</span><span>  mation  be  correct,  three  or  four  claims  have</span><span>  been  pegged  off,  and  the  prospectors  are</span><span>  hemmed  in  on  each  side.  The  mining  popula-</span><span>  tion  at  Mount  Wheeler  has  for  a  long  time</span><span>  been  very  meagre,  numbering  only  about  seven</span><span>  or  eight  men  ;  and  until  further  information</span><span>  is  obtained,  and  time  allowed  for  testing  the</span><span>  ground,  the  present  find  does  not  warrant  the</span><span>  ""  rush  ""  of  even  a  single  digger,  as  it  may</span><span>  turn  out  to  be  a  mere  patch.  Further  news</span><span>  from  the  place  will,  however,  be  awaited  with</span></p> <p><span>  interest.</span></p> <p><span>  A  FIRE  broke  out  on  the  premises  of  Tatter-</span><span>  sall's  Hotel,  East-street,  on  Saturday  forenoon,</span><span>  resulting  in  the  destruction  of  a  stable,  the</span><span>  covering  to  the  saleyard,  and  some  out-</span><span>  buildings  used  as  bedrooms,  etc.,  besides  a</span><span>  kitchen,  a  cab,  and  various  articles  of  furni-</span><span>  ture  and  clothing.  The  fire  is  believed  to</span><span>  have  originated  from  without,  and  arose,  pro-</span><span>  bably,  from  a  passer-by  throwing  down  a</span><span>  lighted  match.  At  any  rate,  the  flames  spread</span><span>  inward  from  the  gate,  and  were  discovered  by</span><span>  a  Chinaman,  who  ran  about  calling  ""  fire,</span><span>  fire  ""  in  the  best  English  he  could  command.</span><span>  Ten  minutes  before  this  Mrs.  Evans  had  been</span><span>  out,  and  there  was  then  no  sign  of  fire.  On</span><span>  the  alarm  being  given,  Mr.  Marquiss  ran  across</span><span>  the  street  with  a  bucket  to  render  assistance,</span><span>  and  Mr.  Evans,  the  proprietor,  got  out  his</span><span>  own  small  hose,  and  directed  a  stream</span><span>  water  on  the  bedrooms,  with  the  view  of  pre-</span><span>  venting  the  spread  of  the  flames  in  that</span><span>  direction.  The  fire  brigade  were  also</span><span>  very  soon  on  the  spot  with  their  hose,</span><span>  and  the  body  of  water  they  directed  on  the</span><span>  burning  buildings  seemed  to  quench  the  flames</span><span>  almost  instantly,  the  fire  being  literally  beaten</span><span>  out  by  the  force  of  the  jet.  This  saved  what</span><span>  remained  of  the  outbuildings  used  as  bed-</span><span>  rooms,  and  prevented  the  flames  from  spread-</span><span>  ing  to  the  hotel  ;  but  the  stable  and  the  roof</span><span>  of  the  sale  yard  were  burnt  down,  the  work</span><span>  destruction  being  over  in  about  a  quarter  of</span><span>  an  hour.  The  wooden  erections  destroyed,</span><span>  which  were  sixteen  years  old,  and  were  of  little</span><span>  value,  were  to  have  been  pulled  down  shortly</span><span>  by  Mr.  Vesperman,  who  recently  purchased</span><span>  the  premises,  in  order  to  make  room  for  better</span><span>  buildings.  The  loss  falls  most  heavily  on  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Evans,  the  present  occupant.  Among  the</span><span>  debris  is  a  fine  Melbourne  car,  which  has  been</span><span>  burnt  to  a  cinder.  We  believe  it  cost  £52,</span><span>  and  in  July  last  £28  was  expended  on  its</span><span>  renovation.  Three  sets  of  harness  were  also</span><span>  built,  besides  beds,  bedding,  and  clothes.  The</span><span>  kitchen  was  likewise  wrecked,  and  a  quantity</span><span>  of  crockery  and  other  articles  destroyed.</span><span>  Two  of  the  lodgers  were  also  losers  to  some</span><span>  extent.  Fortunately,  a  horse,  a  waggonette,</span><span>  and  a  buggy  were  got  out  without  damage  ;</span><span>  but  some  sitting  fowls  were  burnt,  as  they</span><span>  could  not  be  reached  owing  to  the  rapid  spread</span><span>  of  the  flames.  There  were  many  willing</span><span>  helpers,  and  all  did  what  they  could,  Mary,</span><span>  the  cook,  running  off  unbidden  with  the</span><span>  kerosene  tin,  and  getting  two  of  the  male</span><span>  helpers  to  save  a  bag  of  flour  ;  and  Mr.  Evans'</span><span>  little  gill  seizing  her  box  of  clothes  and  drag-</span><span>  ging  it  across  the  street,  until  kindly  assisted</span><span>  by  the  Police  Magistrate,  who  happened  to</span><span>  meet  her.  Some  of  the  helpers  had  to  run  for</span><span>  it  when  the  timbers  began  to  fall,  and  one  man</span><span>  had  a  narrow  escape  from  being  crushed  under</span><span>  the  iron-proof  of  the  sale  yard  as  it  came  crash-</span><span>  nig  to  the  ground.  Mr.  Evans  estimates  his</span><span>  loss  at  about  £150,  and  we  regret  to  say  that</span><span>  he  is  totally  uninsured.</span></p> <p><span>  The  last  Calcutta  Gazette  contains  the  Secre-</span><span>  tary  of  State's  despatch,  relative  to  the  storm-</span><span>  wave  which  passed  over  Eastern  Bengal  in</span><span>  November,  1876.  The  total  loss  of  life,  in-</span><span>  clusive  of  deaths  from  cholera,  was  165,000,</span><span>  or  5000  less  than  originally  estimated.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin,</span><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  FEBRUARY  20,  1878.</span></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  A  FEW  weeks  ago  we  published  a  rough</span><span>  statement  of  the  exports  from  the  port  of</span><span>  Rockhampton  during  last  year.  To-day</span><span>  the  complete  returns  of  imports  and</span><span>  exports  are  given  in  our  commercial</span><span>  column,  and  will  be  found  of  more  than</span><span>  common  interest.  There  is  an  increase</span><span>  in  both  inward  and  outward  trade,  and</span><span>  the  figures  speak  eloquently  to  those</span><span>  among  us  who  allege  that  the  district  is</span><span>  standing  still.</span></p> <p><span>  One  of  the  most  noticeable  facts</span><span>  revealed  by  the  returns  is  the  growth  of</span><span>  our  direct  export  trade  with  London,</span><span>  while  a  slight  falling  off  appears  in  the</span><span>  direct  imports.  The  returns  for  the  last</span><span>  three  years  have  been  :—</span></p> <p><span>  Great  Britain.|Imports.|Exports.</span></p> <p><span>  1875|£40,632|£94,257</span><span>  1876|77,797|206,556</span><span>  1877|70,646|335,187</span></p> <p><span>  Thus  it  appears  that  while,  as  compared</span><span>  with  last  year,  the  imports  under  this</span><span>  head  have  been  almost  stationary,  the</span><span>  exports  have  increased  by  £128,631,  or</span><span>  about  sixty  per  cent.,  on  the  previous</span><span>  year.  This  increase  is  possibly  not  all</span><span>  legitimate,  wool  having  come  to  hand</span><span>  rather  earlier  in  1877  than  in  1876</span><span>  through  the  extension  of  the  railway.</span><span>  Still,  there  must  have  been  progress,  as</span><span>  a  large  portion  of  the  annual  clip  had</span></p> <p><span>  to  come  down  after  the  31st  December.</span></p> <p><span>  The  gross  imports  show  an  increase  of</span><span>  £62,887,  or  a  fraction  under  twenty  per</span><span>  cent  as  compared  with  last  year.  This</span><span>  indicates  either  an  accession  of  popu-</span><span>  lation  to  that  extent  enlarged  consuming</span><span>  power  through  greater  prosperity,  or  the</span><span>  starting  of  new  enterprises.  Probably,  the</span><span>  increase  is  due  to  all  three  causes  ;  but  in</span><span>  any  case  it  cannot  be  deemed  otherwise</span><span>  than  satisfactory.  The  gross  imports</span><span>  and  exhorts  for  the  past  three  years  have</span></p> <p><span>  been  :—</span></p> <p><span>  Date.|Imports.|Exports.</span></p> <p><span>  1875|£299,419|£529,398</span><span>  1876|322,102|600,915</span><span>  1877|384,989|735,814</span></p> <p><span>  The  items  of  export  will  show  what</span><span>  was  the  condition  of  the  several  indus-</span><span>  tries  of  the  district  during  the  year.  The</span><span>  leading  export  continues  to  be  wool,  and</span><span>  a  comparison  of  the  returns  of  the  last</span><span>  five  years  gives  the  annexed  figures  :—</span></p> <p><span>  WOOL  EXPORTED.</span></p> <p><span>  1873  (value)  ...  £345,999</span><span>  1874  ...  324,234</span><span>  1875  ...  378,840</span></p> <p><span>  1876  ...  362,329</span></p> <p><span>  1877  ...  455,329</span></p> <p></span></p> <p><span>  The  comparative  Quantities  for  the  two</span></p> <p><span>  years  were—</span><span>  |Lbs.|Lbs.</span></p> <p><span>  1876—Clean|2,419,301|</span></p> <p><span>  Greasy|4,303,949|</span><span>  |  |6,723,250</span><span>  1877—Clean|4,748,269</span></p> <p><span>  Greasy|3,809,681|</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><span>  |  |8,557,950</span></p> <p><span>  It  will  be  seen  that,  despite  the</span><span>  drought,  the  proportion  of  washed  wool</span><span>  has  greatly  increased,  which  indicates</span><span>  that  the  actual  wool  fibre  exported  has</span><span>  been  greater  than  is  shown  by  a  com-</span><span>  parison  of  the  pounds  weight  of  the</span><span>  respective  years.  Recollecting  that</span><span>  1877  was  a  disastrous  year  in  the</span><span>  intermediate  districts,  drought  and  mar-</span><span>  supials  having  materially  diminished  the</span><span>  wool  clip  expected  thence,  the  returns  are</span><span>  very  satisfactory,  and  prove  that  any  shrink-</span><span>  age  in  the  production  of  those  districts</span></p> <p><span>  has  been  more  than  compensated  by  the</span></p> <p><span>  expansion  farther  west.</span></p> <p><span>  The  exports  of  copper  exhibit  less</span></p> <p><span>  fluctuation  than  might  have  been  antici-</span><span>  pated  ;  and  that  the  year  shows  an  actual</span></p> <p><span>  increase  will  excite  surprise  when  it  is</span></p> <p><span>  remembered  that  the  Peak  Downs  Com-</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><span>  pany  was  in  a  moribund  condition.  The</span><span>  explanation  is  that  the  Dee  mine  threw</span><span>  in  its  contribution,  and  thus  made  1877</span></p> <p><span>  the  most  productive  year  of  the  five,  as</span><span>  is  here  shown  :—</span></p> <p><span>  COPPER  EXPORTED.</span></p> <p><span>  1873  (value)  ...  £84,590</span><span>  1874  ...  57,069</span><span>  1875  ...  48,758</span><span>  1876  ...  115,187</span><span>  1877  ...  119,765</span></p> <p><span>  Gold,  unfortunately,  shows  a  falling  off,</span></p> <p><span>  and  there  is  no  immediate  prospect  of</span><span>  improvement.  The  exports  for  the  five</span></p> <p><span>  years  were  :—</span></p> <p><span>  1873  ...  10,500  ozs.</span><span>  1874  ...  6,687</span><span>  1875  ...  4,248</span><span>  1876  ...  9,965</span><span>  1877  ...  5,431</span><span>  Preserved  meats  last  year  did  not</span></p> <p><span>  having  regard  to  the  late  opening  and</span><span>  premature  closing  of  work  at  the  factory,</span></p> <p><span>  the  results  are  not  unsatisfactory.  The</span></p> <p><span>  exports  were  :—</span></p> <p><span>  1875—1,329,651  lbs.  ...  £27,408</span><span>  1876—2,284,120  ,,  ...  63,557</span><span>  1877—1,991,990  ,,  ...  55,  314</span></p> <p><span>  In  this  item,  unless  some  unforeseen</span></p> <p><span>  event  occurs,  there  will  be  a</span></p> <p><span>  still  greater  falling  off  during  the  current</span></p> <p><span>  year  ;  indeed,  present  anticipations</span><span>  are  that  nil  will  have  to  be  written</span></p> <p><span>  against  this  article  of  export.  Hides  and</span><span>  tallow  both  show  an  increase,  the</span><span>  numbers  of  the  former  exported  having</span><span>  been  14,941  in  1876,  and  18,149  in</span></p> <p><span>  1877,  the  respective  values  having  been</span><span>  £16,762  and  £19,879.  The  tallow</span></p> <p><span>  exported  was  810  tons  in  1876  and  979</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><span>  tons  in  1877,  the  respective  values  having</span><span>  been  £29,393  and  £34,369.</span></p> <p><span>  A  new  export  is  tobacco,  of  which</span><span>  3896  lbs.  were  shipped.  A  portion  of</span><span>  this,  however,  possibly  comprised  re</span><span>  exports.  But  1878  ought  to  show  a</span><span>  respectable  total  in  this  article,  the</span><span>  Cawarral  plantations  having  a  good  crop</span><span>  now  being  harvested.</span></p> <p><span>  Looking  to  the  future,  there  is  every</span><span>  reason  to  believe  that  our  imports  and</span><span>  exports  will  increase  in  a  still  faster</span><span>  ratio  than  heretofore.  The  numberof  sheep</span><span>  in  the  western  districts  must  be  rapidly</span><span>  multiplying,  and  as  breeding  for  numbers</span><span>  is  no  longer  fashionable,  the  annual  wool</span><span>  clip  must  rapidly  increase,  for  there  will</span><span>  be  augmentation  in  the  average  weight  as</span><span>  well  as  in  the  gross  number  of  fleeces.</span><span>  The  production  of  cattle  will  certainly</span><span>  not  fall  off,  and  if  for  a  time  the  increase</span><span>  cannot  be  turned  to  profitable  account,</span><span>  there  is  no  doubt  that  some  means  of</span><span>  utilisation  will  soon  be  discovered.  The</span></p> <p><span>  yield  of  copper  is  not  likely  to  diminish,</span><span>  and  gold  has  probably  touched  its  lowest</span><span>  point.  The  disproportion  between</span><span>  imports  and  exports  shows  that  the</span><span>  district  is  far  more  than  paying  its  way,</span><span>  and  that  as  scope  for  enterprise  is</span></p> <p><span>  offered  there  will  be  no  lack  of  available</span><span>  capital.  Actual  settlement  is  making</span><span>  steady  progress,  and  we  do  not  despair</span><span>  of  ere  long  seeing  our  list  of  exports</span><span>  supplemented  by  agricultural  produce.</span><span>  As  already  stated,  a  beginning  has  been</span><span>  made  with  one  article—tobacco—within</span></p> <p><span>  the  past  year,  and  the  experiment  is</span><span>  deemed  very  satisfactory  by  its  maker.</span><span>  Other  payable  products  will  ere  long  be</span><span>  found,  for  it  is  clear  that  soil  capable  of</span><span>  producing  luxuriant  and  nutritious  grasses</span><span>  in  its  primeval  state  cannot  be  incapable</span><span>  of  producing  marketable  products  by</span><span>  cultivation.  Without  denying  the  whim-</span><span>  sicalities  of  our  climate,  or  contending</span><span>  that  an  optimist  view  should  be  taken  of</span><span>  the  losses  they  occasion,  we  yet  hold  that</span><span>  our  climate  is  not  worse  than  that  of  many</span><span>  agricultural  countries,  and  that  it  would</span><span>  be  arrant  folly  to  allow  energy  and</span><span>  enterprise  to  be  checked  by  the  accep-</span><span>  tance  of  pessimist  doctrines.  Australian</span></p> <p><span>  colonists  have  a  wilderness  to  conquer,</span><span>  and  we  are  confident  that  they  will</span></p> <p></p> <p><span>  display  the  traditional  Anglo-Saxon</span><span>  vigour  which  alone  is  requisite  to  ensure</span><span>  ultimate  victory.  The  example  of  South</span><span>  Australia  is  worth  imitation.  With  an</span><span>  average  rainfall  much  below  that  of</span><span>  Queensland,  and  aridity  intensified  by</span><span>  frequent  hot  winds,  she  has  this  year</span><span>  150,000  tons  of  wheat  available  for  ship-</span><span>  ment  after  supplying  the  wants  of  her</span><span>  own  people.  Here  is  a  case  in  which  a</span><span>  colony  exports  some  three  or  four  tons</span><span>  of  wheat  per  head  of  her  bread-winning</span><span>  population.  And  why  should  not</span><span>  Queensland  do  likewise  ?  If  she  can-</span><span>  not  grow  wheat  to  advantage,  she  may</span><span>  unquestionably  produce  sugar,  maize,</span></p> <p><span>  tobacco,  and  other  products  having  an</span></p> <p><span>  exportable  value.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  second  monthly  meeting  of  the  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  Terminable  Building  Society,  No.  7,</span><span>  will  take  place  this  evening  at  the  Secretary's</span></p> <p><span>  office,  at  the  customary  hour.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Board  of  Inquiry  into  the  stranding  of</span><span>  the  Queensland,  s.,  resumed  its  sitting  yester-</span><span>  day  morning  and  after  hearing  further</span><span>  evidence  adjourned  until  this  morning  at</span></p> <p><span>  eleven.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Leura  line  of  mails  due  on  Tuesday  at</span></p> <p><span>  two  p.m.,  and  Gladstone  and  Calliope  mails,</span><span>  referred  to  yesterday,  have  not  yet  reached</span><span>  the  Post  Office.

So  it  reached  us  at  an</span><span>  early  hour  yesterday,  and  was  so  printed  ;  but</span><span>  there  was  evidently  a  gross  mistake  in</span><span>  transmission,  the  estimate  probably  being</span></p> <p><span>  thirteen  to  fourteen  bushels  per  acre.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  works  at  the  Fitzroy  training  wall</span><span>  have  been  necessarily  suspended,  in  consequence</span><span>  of  the  flood  in  the  river  having  raised  the</span><span>  water  level  by  some  four  or  five  feet.  Mr.</span><span>  Kearney  has  been  unable  to  cart  stone  during</span><span>  the  rain  through  the  softness  of  the  ground,</span></p> <p><span>  and  he  is  now  unable  to  tilt  the  stone  into  the</span></p> <p><span>  punt  in  consequence  of  the  wharf  being  too</span><span>  low.  The  department  are  building  a  high</span><span>  level  wharf,  which  on  the  subsidence  of  the</span><span>  flood  will  enable  loading  to  be  carried  on  in</span><span>  any  state  of  the  tide.

A  charge  of  assault</span><span>  preferred  against  the  defendant  by  Henry</span></p> <p><span>  Hart  was  dismissed.  The  adjourned  case  of</span><span>  Selina  Lilian  Cavanagh  v.

If  Reuter's  version  of  the  inter-</span></p> <p><span>  view  between  those  two  diplomatists  be  correct,</span></p> <p><span>  the  defensive  position  assumed  by  the  British</span><span>  Minister  is  not  such  as  will  be  agreeable  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  average  Englishman.  Earl  Derby  seems</span></p> <p><span>  to  be  playing  the  role  of  Mr.  Gladstone,  Mr.</span><span>  John  Bright,  or  some  peace-at-any-price</span></p> <p><span>  cotton-lord.  The  British  Foreign  Minister</span><span>  ""  expressed  the  hope  that  the  Russian  troops</span><span>  are  not  moving  forward  to  Gallipoli,  whereby</span><span>  the  communication  of  the  British  fleet  at  Con-</span></p> <p><span>  stantinople  might  be  threatened.""  But  the</span></p> <p><span>  Minister  went  even  further.  He  said</span><span>  in  effect  that  if  the  Russians  captured  our</span><span>  ironclad  fleet  or  blew  it  up  with  torpedoes,</span><span>  Her  Majesty's  Government  would  decline</span><span>  the  responsibility  for  the  consequences  !  We</span></p> <p><span>  hope  Reuter  is  entirely  wrong.  Surely  no</span></p> <p><span>  British  Minister  would  so  degrade  British</span><span>  honour  as  to  inform  a  Russian  ambassador</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><span>  that  he  hoped  the  communications  of  a  British</span></p> <p><span>  fleet  were  not  about  to  be  cut  off,  and  that  if</span></p> <p><span>  they  were  the  consequences  would  be  serious.</span><span>  As  though  even  the  British  ambassador  could</span></p> <p><span>  have  for  an  instant  supposed  that  such  conse-</span><span>  quences  would  not  be  serious  !  It  has  come  to</span><span>  a  pretty  pass  when  ""  the  flag  that  braved  a</span></p> <p><span>  thousand  years  ""  is  not  better  respected  than</span></p> <p><span>  Lord  Derby's  ""  hopes""  and  cautions  seem  to</span><span>  imply.  If  the  Russians  mean  mischief  they</span><span>  will  be  encouraged  by  such  drivelling  as  this,</span></p> <p></p> <p><span>  and  they  will  amuse  the  British  Govern-</span><span>  ment  until  Gallipoli  and  Constantinople  are</span></p> <p><span>  both  in  their  possession.  Both  places  are</span></p> <p><span>  believed  to  be  fortified  with  modern  guns,  and</span></p> <p><span>  the  Russians  once  in  possession  would  pro-</span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><span>  bably  be  able  to  maintain  possession  despite</span></p> <p><span>  ironclads  and  other  floating  batteries  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  command  of  Great  Britain.  Would  it  not  be</span><span>  wiser  and  move  dignified  on  the  part  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  British  Government  to  withdraw  the  fleet  and</span><span>  let  Russian  and  Turk  fight  their  own  battle</span></p> <p><span>  out  ?  Surely  nothing  is  gained  by  threatening</span></p> <p><span>  to  strike,  and  at  the  same  time  displaying</span></p> <p><span>  mortal  terror  of  the  ""  consequences  ""  that</span><span>  might  ensue.  The  Solicitor-General  of</span><span>  England  says  it  is  all  Mr.  Gladstone's  fault</span><span>  that  the  country  did  not  assert  itself  long  ago  ;</span><span>  but  the  public  will  say  that  if  the  action  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  Government  is  to  be  paralysed  by</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Gladstone,  it  would  be  better  that  he</span></p> <p><span>  should  assume  the  responsibilities  of  the</span><span>  situation  at  once.</span></p> <p><span>  PASTORAL  MATTERS  AT  ALBURY.—The</span></p> <p><span>  market  for  stock  and  stations  was  never</span></p> <p><span>  duller  than  it  is  at  present.

This,  of  course,  is  owing  to  the</span><span>  parched-up  state  of  the  country,  and  fears  of</span></p> <p><span>  a  continuation  of  the  drought.

And  it  linust  be  admitted</span></p> <p><span>  that  amidst  thc  clamour  of  diverse</span></p> <p><span>  opinions  and  confli  :ling  interests  the</span><span>  practical  politician  is  induced  to  accept</span><span>  compromises  on  mat  ers  of  fundamental</span><span>  importance  as  well  a:  of  detail.  Judging</span><span>  by  reports  of  late  parliamentary  pro-</span><span>  ceedings  in  New  South  Wales,  Mr.</span><span>  Farnell  has  fallen  int  >  this  error,  and  as</span><span>  a  consequence  the  cblony  is  threatened</span><span>  with  an  electoral!  bill  which  must</span><span>  inevitably  lower  the  ¡  latus  of  the  repre-</span><span>  sentative  chamber  in  that  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  The  present  Legi  lative  Assembly  of</span><span>  New  South  Wales  is  composed  of</span><span>  seventy-two  member  elected  by  sixty</span><span>  constituencies,  and  jne  by  the  Uni-</span><span>  versity.  East  and  Vest  Sydney  each</span><span>  returns  four  memtlers,  nine  other</span></p> <p><span>  electorates  return  more  than  one</span></p> <p><span>  member,  and  the  remaining  forty-nine</span><span>  are  single  electorates..  A  week  or  two</span><span>  ago  Mr.  Farnell  introduced  an  amending</span><span>  Electoral  Hill-avowedly  a  temporary</span><span>  measure-increasing  the  number  of</span><span>  members  lo  ninety-nine,  including  the</span><span>  representative  of  the  University.  The</span><span>  bill  was  lost  through  a  technicality,</span><span>  and  it  having  to  be  introduced  afresh  Mr.</span><span>  Farnell  further  amended  it  by  increasing</span><span>  the  number  of  members  to  102.  This</span></p> <p><span>  seems  a  large  increase,  but  it  did  not</span></p> <p><span>  satisfy  honourable  members,  for  we  are</span><span>  informed  by  telegraph  that  the  House  in</span><span>  Committee  of  me  Whole  further</span></p> <p><span>  augmented  the  rjumber  by  thirteen,</span><span>  making  a  total  oil  115  members  in  the</span><span>  Assembly.  Such  an  increase  cannot  but</span><span>  have  the  effect  of/  injuring  the  status  of</span><span>  the  House  as  a  liigislative  body.</span></p> <p><span>  In  New  South/Wales  the  viciousness</span><span>  of  thc  single  elec  torate  system  has  been</span><span>  long  acknowledj  ed,  and  therefore  Mr.</span><span>  Farnell,  although  not  introducing  a  com-</span><span>  plete  measure,  attacks  that  evil  by</span><span>  reducing  thc  nut  ber  of  single  electorates</span><span>  to  thirty-two.  J  nd  bearing  in  mind  the</span><span>  proposed  increas  oftwenty-ninemembers,</span></p> <p><span>  it  must  be  confc;  ;ed  that  the  bill  contem-</span></p> <p><span>  plates  a  very  in  portant  modification  in</span><span>  ttie  electoral  sj  stem.  For  it  creates</span><span>  sixteen  constitue  icies  with  two  members,</span><span>  five  with  three  nembers,  two  with  four</span><span>  members,  one  wi  h  five,  and  one  with  six</span><span>  members.  Th«  was  before  the  altera-</span><span>  tions  made  in  1  Committee,  which  have</span><span>  probably  increasi  d  the  number  of  single</span></p> <p><span>  electorates,  as  i  sme  honorable  rac(n*i</span><span>  bers  vigorously  Jbject  to  the  swamp-</span><span>  ing  of  mino:  ties  which  would</span><span>  result  from  tl  :  merging  of  the</span><span>  smaller  in  the  larger  constituencies.</span><span>  Mr.  Parnell's  bil  proposed  to  give  one</span><span>  member  to  cac  i  1738  voters.  In</span><span>  Queensland  our  1  ^distribution  of  1872</span></p> <p><span>  was  based  on  the  nit  of  800  voters.  In</span></p> <p><span>  New  South  Wal  s  neither  gross  nor</span><span>  adult  male  popul  tion  appears  to  have</span><span>  been  taken  into  a  count.  The  adjust-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  has  been  rr  ide  on  the  basis  of</span><span>  voters.  But  this  is  equivalent  to  the</span><span>  adult  male  basis  ac  ipted  here  in  1872,</span><span>  but  which  Mr.  E  niglas  and  his  col-</span><span>  leagues  are  now  &lt;  esirous  of  sweeping</span><span>  away.  The  objec  cannot  be  to  make</span><span>  our  electoral  syste  n  more  democratic</span><span>  than  before,  but  sifi  ply  to  give  a  greater</span><span>  preponderance  lo/  the  metropolitan  dis-</span><span>  tricts  than  they  now  enjoy.  Why  the</span><span>  party  in  power  she  uld  desire  so  radical  a</span><span>  change  it  is  difficult  to  discover,  seeing</span><span>  that  Mr.  Palmer's!

The  provability,  indeed,  is</span><span>  that  the  Governmcntldo  not  expect  it</span><span>  to  pass,  but  that  thejl  present  it  as  the</span><span>  materials  for  a  good  ci  y  on  which  to  go</span><span>  to  thc  country.  They  argue  no  doubt</span><span>  that  they  will  thus  ar  msc  a  south-and</span><span>  norlh  contest,  and  thai  the  attention  of</span><span>  the  southern  constituí  rides  will  bc  di-</span><span>  verted  from  Minister  al  blunders  and</span><span>  deficiencies.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  NOVEMBER  ll,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  electors  of  Rockhampton  have</span><span>  now  the  speeches  and  opinions  of</span><span>  three  candidates  before  them.  On  the</span><span>  whole  we  think  it  will  be  conceded  that</span><span>  all  these  deliverances  are  of  considerably</span><span>  more  than  average  merit.  Comparing</span><span>  them  with  the  narrow  localism  of  utter-</span><span>  ances  in  manv  of  the  southern  parts  of</span></p> <p><span>  policy  of  our  three  Opposition  can-</span><span>  didates  stands  out  in  bold  relief.  They</span><span>  all  take  broad  views  of  public  questions,</span><span>  and  evince  a  manliness,  decision,</span><span>  and  definiteness  which  indicate</span><span>  that  those  who  make  them  have</span><span>  not  accepted  their  facts  upon</span><span>  trust,  bat  have  collated  them  by  indi-</span><span>  vidual  research,  or  given  them  as  the</span><span>  results  of  actual  experience.  The  candi-</span><span>  dates  do  not  entirely  agree  in  details,</span><span>  but  in  all  fundamentals  they  speak  so</span><span>  much  alike,  and  so  much  to  the  point,</span><span>  as  to  probably  carry  conviction  to  most</span><span>  unbiassed  minds.  We  think  that  they  all</span><span>  display  true  liberalism,  and  a  determi-</span><span>  nation  to  eschew  class  distinctions  and</span><span>  prejudices.  All  pronounce  in  favour  of</span></p> <p><span>  railways  and  other  reproductive  works.  I</span><span>  All  agree  that  the  funds  for  construe-  j</span><span>  tion  must  be  obtained  from  the</span><span>  British  capitalist  ;  that  the  defi-</span><span>  ciency  between  net  proceeds  from  rail-</span></p> <p><span>  ways  and  the  annual  interest  charge  j</span><span>  must  be  obtained  from  the  Crown  Lands  ;  1</span><span>  that  land  ought  not  to  be  forced  upon</span><span>  the  Crown  tenants  by  offering  it  for  sale</span></p> <p><span>  in  the  public  auction  room  ;  that  ample  j</span><span>  provision  should  be  made  for  the  present  |</span><span>  and  prospective  wants  of  selectors,</span><span>  especially  along  the  railway  lines;  and</span><span>  that  a  better  tenure  should  be  offered  to</span><span>  the  western  squatters  for  portions  of</span><span>  their  runs  on  consideration  of  a  higher</span><span>  rent  They  also  agree  that,  no  matter</span><span>  what  Ministry  is  in  power,  effective  re-</span><span>  presentation  will  secure  a  full  measure  of</span><span>  justice  for  our  district.  Possibly  per-</span><span>  sonal  objections  may  be  felt  by</span><span>  some  electors  to  each  of  the  candidates,</span><span>  but  we  fail  to  perceive  what  serious</span><span>  fault  can  be  found  with  their  opinions,</span><span>  which  appear  to  us  to  be  the  outcome</span><span>  of  an  enlightened  appreciation  of  the</span><span>  true  interests  of  the  colony  and  of  a</span></p> <p><span>  sincere  desire  to  nromote  them.</span></p> <p><span>  The  public  now  await  deliverances</span><span>  from  the  opposite  stand  point.  Mr.</span><span>  Rea's  meeting  on  Friday  evening  threw</span><span>  absolutely  no  light  upon  the  question  at</span><span>  issue,  and  was  evidently  treated  more  as</span><span>  a  joke  than  as  a  serious  business.  The</span><span>  other  candidate  is  an  avowed  Minis-</span><span>  terialist  ;  or,  at  any  rate,  has  been  in-</span><span>  troduced  as  such  by  his  friends,  and</span><span>  possibly  may  be  able  to  adduce  reasons</span><span>  why  the  electors  should  place  him</span><span>  at  the  head  of  the  poll.  That  his</span><span>  candidature  is  the  result  of  Mr.  Griffith's</span><span>  visit  there  is  every  reason  to  believe,  as</span><span>  it  was  generally  known  that  Mr.  Paterson</span><span>  had  previously  declined  to  contest  a</span><span>  seat.  It  is  obviously  his  duty,  there-</span><span>  fore,  to  shoiv  what  claims  the  present</span><span>  Ministry  have  to  the  confidence  of  the</span><span>  colony,  and  especially  to  the  votes  of</span><span>  the  electors  of  Rockhampton.  We</span><span>  cannot  understand  how  Mr.  Paterson</span><span>  will  effectually  defend  his  party,  or  con-</span><span>  trovert  the  mass  of  damaging  facts</span><span>  adduced  in  the  three  speeches  lately</span><span>  delivered  in  the  School  of  Arts.  It  wili</span></p> <p><span>  oe  useless  at  this  time  of  day  to  try  to</span><span>  win  the  seat  on  the  anti-squatting  cry,</span><span>  for  it  no  longer  possesses  the  force  at-</span><span>  tached  to  it  in  former  times,  and  the</span><span>  electors  of  Rockhampton  are  too  well</span><span>  instructed  to  be  infuriated  by  the  exhibi-</span><span>  tion  of  a  faded  red  rag.</span></p> <p><span>  Perhaps,  however,  Mr.  Paterson  will</span><span>  not  openly  avow  his  Ministerial</span><span>  sympathies,  but  base  his  claim  to</span><span>  election  on  the  ground  that  he  is  a</span><span>  better  or  more  honest  man  than  either</span><span>  I  of  the  old  members  for  the  town  who</span><span>  I  seek  to  give  it  the  benefit  of  their</span><span>  j  matured  Parliamentary  and  political</span><span>  I  experience.  Mr.  Paterson  may  be  able</span></p> <p><span>  and  clever,  but  he  is  a  novice  in  public</span><span>  life,  and  as  a  young  member  cannot  be</span><span>  expected  for  years  to  carry  the  weight</span><span>  which  attaches  to  older  and  more</span><span>  experienced  men.  In  fact,  if  he  do</span><span>  not  appear  as  a  Ministerial  advocate  his</span><span>  candidature  can  only  be  justified  on  the</span><span>  ground  that  the  two  gentlemen  previously</span><span>  in  the  field  had  by  their  incapacity,</span><span>  indolence,  or  insincerity  forfeited  thc</span><span>  confidence  of  thc  second  town  in  thc</span><span>  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  It  must  not  be  understood,  however,</span><span>  that  wc  blame  Mr.  Paterson  for  accepting</span><span>  the  call  made  to  him  by  certain  electors</span><span>  of  Rockhampton.  If,  as  it  would</span><span>  appear,  his  requisition  had  over  400</span><span>  bona  fide  signatures,  it  would  have  been</span><span>  strange  had  he  neglected  the  invitation</span><span>  it  embodied.  He  could  not  know,</span><span>  and  possibly  did  not  suspect,  the</span><span>  means  adopted  to  procure  those</span><span>  signatures  ;  nor,  as  a  youn?  politician,</span><span>  would  he  '¿i  alvare  0f  tlle</span><span>  modem  fashion  adopted  by  many</span></p> <p><span>  electors,  who  attach  their  names  to  a</span><span>  requisition  without  intending  to  incur  any</span><span>  obligation  to  vote  for  the  candidate.</span><span>  The  object  generally  appears  to  be  to</span><span>  bring  out  a  good  field  for  the  electoral</span><span>  race,  and  then  let  the  best  man  win.</span><span>  The  phrase  in  a  requisition,  ""  we  will</span><span>  usc  our  best  efforts  to  secure  your  re-</span><span>  turn,""  appears  to  have  a^  merely  con-</span><span>  ventional  significance,  just  as  a  sender</span><span>  of  a  letter  writes  ""  your  obedient</span><span>  servant,""  when  neither  obedience  nor</span><span>  servility  i  .  bended  to  be  applied.  We</span><span>  donotlieie  enter  upon  the  morality  of</span><span>  these  conventional  fictions.  All  we</span></p> <p><span>  point  out  is  that  they  do  exist,  and  that</span><span>  candidates  are  too  frequently  thrown  off</span><span>  their  guard  by  them.</span></p> <p><span>  So  far  the  campaign  has  been  con-</span><span>  ducted  in  a  very  good  spirit.  We  hope</span><span>  this  pleasing  feature  will  be  allowed  to</span><span>  continue,  and  that  the  contest  will  be  one</span><span>  of  principles  rather  than  of  persons.  Mr.</span><span>  Paterson  may  depend,  we  think,  upon</span><span>  getting  a  quiet  and  attentive  hearing  if</span><span>  only  for  the  reason  that  he  is  fighting  an</span><span>  uphill  battle,  and  hampered  by  many</span><span>  disadvantages.</span></p> <p><span>  IT  is  notified  that  Rosewood  Crossing  has</span><span>  been  appointed  an  additional  polling-place  for</span></p> <p><span>  thc  electorate  of  Blackall.</span></p> <p><span>  MR.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  V/THUKSDAV,  OCTOBER  10,  1878.  f</span></p> <p><span>  THE  newly  appointed  Trustees  of  the</span><span>  Rockhampton  Grammar  School  have</span></p> <p><span>  done  well  in  taking  advantage  of  the  j</span><span>  presence  of  the  Secretary  for  Public</span></p> <p><span>  Instruction  amongst  us  to  endeavour  to  .</span></p> <p><span>  come  to  an  understanding  with  him  as  j</span><span>  regards  the  site  and  other  questions</span><span>  having  to  do  with  the  establishment  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  school.</span></p> <p><span>  The  difference  of  opinion  prevailing  as</span><span>  to  the  proper  site  for  the  school  has</span><span>  interfered  seriously  with  the  subscriptions</span><span>  towards  the  cost  of  the  building;</span><span>  but  despite  this  difficulty,  the  sum  of</span><span>  ,£1500  has  now  been  raised,  and  there</span><span>  is  no  longer  any  room  to  doubt  that  the</span><span>  additional  £s°°  required  to  complete</span><span>  the  sum  of  ""-£2000,  and  enable  the</span><span>  Trustees  to  claim  the  higher  rate  of  en-</span><span>  dowment,  will  be  obtained,  and  that</span><span>  without  any  serious  trouble.  Under  the</span><span>  circumstances,  the  success  which  has</span><span>  been  attained  is  very  gratifying.</span><span>  It  must  be  borne  in  mind,</span><span>  Jiowever,  that  Jhe  question  of  site  is</span><span>  still""  unsettled,  âaa~its  proper  solution</span><span>  has,  in  tact,  been  simply  delegated  by</span><span>  the  general  body  of  subscribers  to  the</span><span>  Trustees.  This  is,  perhaps,  as  it  should</span><span>  be  ;  but  the  responsibility  resting  upon</span><span>  the  Trustees  is  a  serious  one,  and</span><span>  should  not  be  lightly  disposed  of.</span></p> <p><span>  At  the  election  of  the  three  Sub-</span><span>  scribers'  Trustees,  some  short  lime</span><span>  since,  a  majority  of  the  subscribers</span><span>  present  were  apparently  in  favour</span><span>  of  a.  town  site,  and  one  or  two</span><span>  speakers  insisted  upon  it  almost  as  a</span><span>  sine  çuâ  non  to  the  successor  the  school.</span><span>  Of  the  gentlemen  chosen  to  represent</span><span>  the  subscribers  on  the  Board  of  Trustees,</span><span>  one  is  a  pronounced  advocate  of  a  town</span><span>  site,  whilst  the  two  others  declined  to</span><span>  pledge  themselves  one  way  or  the  other</span><span>  -one  of  them,  however,  stating  that  he</span><span>  was  rather  inclined  to  the  selection  of  a</span><span>  suburban  site.  The  indecision  of  these</span><span>  two  gentlemen  possibly  arose  out  of</span><span>  a  laudable  desire  on  their  part  to  consult</span><span>  as  far  as  possible  the  wishes  of  sub-</span><span>  scribers  who  may  differ  from  them  on</span><span>  this  question,  rather  than  from  any</span><span>  hesitation  in  their  own  mind,  as  to  the</span><span>  most  desirable  locality  for  the  school.</span><span>  However,  the  question  does  not  rest</span><span>  entirely  with  the  Subscribers'Trustees,  as</span><span>  the  Board  consists  of  seven  mem-</span><span>  bers,  four  of  whom  represent  the</span><span>  Government  These  latter  are  not</span><span>  placed  there  in  opposition  to  the</span><span>  subscribers  ;  on  the  contrary,  they  have</span><span>  been  appointed  from  a  number  of</span><span>  gentlemen  submitted  by  the  subscribers</span><span>  to  enable  the  Government  to  make  a</span><span>  choice  in  accordance  with  the  subscri-</span><span>  bers'  wishes.  But  an  important  principle</span><span>  is  involved  in  the  manner  in  which  the</span><span>  Board  is  constituted.  The  cost  of  the</span><span>  school  is  borne  partly  by  the</span><span>  subscribers  and  partly  by  the</span><span>  Government,  and  both  parties  have</span><span>  a  share  in  the  management.  It  will  there-</span><span>  fore  be  seen  that  in  any  question  coming</span><span>  before  the  Board,  the  particular  wishes</span><span>  of  the  subscribers,  though  entitled  to</span><span>  due  weight,  are  not  paramount.  The</span><span>  subscribers,  for  instance,  may  desire  a</span><span>  town  site,  but  the  latter  may  not  be  for</span><span>  the  public  advantage  or  calculated  to</span><span>  promote  the  success  of  the  school.</span><span>  However,  as  the  Board  is  constituted,</span><span>  we  have  no  reason  to  doubt  but  that  this</span><span>  question  will  be  treated  without  bias  and</span><span>  with  due  regard  to  the  future  as  well  as</span><span>  present  interests  of  the  town  and  district.</span></p> <p><span>  We  are  very  much  gratified  to  find</span><span>  that  Mr.  Griffith  has  thrown  in  his  weight</span><span>  most  decidedly  in  favour  of  the  Range</span><span>  or  some  other  suburban  site.  He  has</span><span>  had  considerable  experience  in  questions</span><span>  of  this  kind,  and  he  is  of  opinion  that</span><span>  the  distance  of  the  Range  from  the</span><span>  centre  of  the  town  is  really  no  objection</span><span>  to  a  site  being  selected  in  that  locality.</span><span>  A  compromise  suggested  by  Mr.  C.  H.</span><span>  Buzacott,  and  which  has  received  the</span><span>  approval  of  the  Under  Secretary  of</span><span>  Public  Instruction  in  Brisbane-that</span><span>  the  school  should  be  erected  on</span><span>  the  present  Grammar  School  reserve</span><span>  and  another  reserve  of  (say)  ten  acres  be</span><span>  obtained  on  the  Range  for  Masters'</span><span>  residence  and  accommodation  ol</span><span>  boarders,  was  mentioned  by  the  deputa-</span><span>  tion.  But  the  present  sile  is  too  small</span><span>  to  admit  of  ample  play  grounds  con</span></p> <p><span>  ¡  nected  with  the  scg  ol  ;  and  Mr.  Griffith</span></p> <p><span>  thought  this  a  very  serious  objection,  as</span><span>  it  undoubtedly  is.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  on  previous  occasions  ex-</span><span>  pressed  our  decided  opinion  in  favour  of</span><span>  the  Range,  and  have  as  yet  seen  no</span><span>  reason  to  alter  it.  The  best  possible</span><span>  provision  for  the  accommodation  and</span><span>  proper  care  of  boarders  is  absolutely</span><span>  necessary,  if  the  school  is  to  be  for  the</span><span>  benefit  of  thc  country  as  well  as  the</span><span>  town.  And  it  is  quite  certain  that</span></p> <p><span>  country  people  will  not  send  their  !</span><span>  !  children  to  the  proposed  school  if  it</span></p> <p><span>  be  wanting  in  this  essential.  It  has</span><span>  been  stated  that  whatever  may  be  the</span><span>  excellence  of  the  new  school  or  the</span><span>  salubrity  of  its  site,  country  residents  will</span><span>  not  patxonise  it  but  will  continue  to  send</span><span>  their  children  to  schools  further  south,</span><span>  and  that  the  school  will  therefore</span><span>  never  be  more  than  a  school  for</span><span>  the  benefit  of  the  town  itself.  But</span><span>  this  is  ail  pure  assumption.  A  school</span><span>  in  a  pleasant  and  salubrious  situation,</span><span>  provided  with  really  good  accommoda-</span><span>  tion  for  boarders,  and  ably  conducted  so</span><span>  that  boys  and  girls  might  be  well  cared</span><span>  for  and  obtain  a  high  class  education,</span><span>  would  not  fail  to  secure  a  fair  share</span><span>  of  support  from  residents  in  the</span><span>  country,  and  would  be  infinitely  superior</span><span>  to  a  second-rate  school  in  the  most</span></p> <p><span>  populous  part  of  the  town.  And  if  its</span><span>  scope  be  practically  confined  within  the</span><span>  limits  of  the  town  boundaries,  it  will,  as</span><span>  a  matter  of  course,  be  conducted  on  a</span><span>  smaller  scale  ;  there  will  be  a  less  expen-</span><span>  sive  staff  of  masters,  and  the  standard</span><span>  of  education  will  be  proportionably</span></p> <p><span>  lowered.</span></p> <p><span>  It  must  also  be  considered  that  the</span><span>  town  in  the  course  of  the  next  fifteen  or</span><span>  twenty  years  must  double  or  treble  its</span><span>  present  population,  and  the  Range  will</span><span>  then  be  regarded  as  a  part  of  the  town</span><span>  proper;  whilst  most  townspeople  who</span><span>  are  able  to  give  their  children  a  better</span><span>  education  than  is  obtainable  at  the  pri-</span><span>  mary  schools,  will  reside  on  the  Range</span><span>  rather  than  in  the  thickly  built  part  of</span><span>  the  town  devoted  to  business  and  near</span><span>  the  river.  But  leaving  the  future</span><span>  out  of  consideration,  we  believe  that'</span><span>  the  school  should  be  placed  on  the</span><span>  Range.  The  distance  from  the  centre</span><span>  of  the  town  to  the  Range  is  not  very</span><span>  great,  and  if  lunch  were  provided  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  school  under  the  direction  of  the  Trustees</span><span>  and  at  a  moderate  charge,  there  would</span><span>  be  no  need  for  pupils  going  to  their</span><span>  homes  in  the  middle  of  the  day,  and  a</span><span>  walk  morning  and  evening  would  be</span><span>  beneficial  rather  than  otherwise  to  boys</span><span>  and  girls  cooped  up  in  town  residences,</span><span>  and  suffering  more  or  less  in  health</span><span>  from  living  in  a  confined  and  tainted</span><span>  atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  are  informed  that  Mr.  Milford  obtained</span></p> <p><span>  an  intimation  yesterday  that  Mr.  King  Ycen  i</span></p> <p><span>  had  been  granted  a  certificate  of  discharge  by  J</span><span>  the  Insolvency  Court.  j</span></p> <p><span>  THE  weather  is  again  forcing  itself  upon</span><span>  attention.  Yesterday  afternoon  it  began  to</span><span>  rain  heavily,  and  continued  almost  without</span><span>  cessation  till  a  late  hour  last  night,  during</span><span>  wkiob  timo  nearly  three  inches  of  rain  must</span></p> <p><span>  tallou.  From  tdcgi  aplite  reports  a  ap-  ]</span><span>  pears  that  the  rain  is  general  in  thc  northern</span><span>  district.  At  Charters  Towers  and  Mill-</span><span>  chester  it  has  been  raining  in  torrents.  The</span><span>  present  season  is  exceptional,  although  old</span><span>  residents  remember  the  time  when  two  or</span><span>  threo  days'  rain  in  the  first  week  of  October</span></p> <p><span>  was  not  unusual.</span></p> <p><span>  OwiKn  to  tho  inclemency  of  the  weather</span><span>  last  night  the  performances  at  the  Oddfellows'</span><span>  Hall  by  the  Bellringers  and  at  the  Theatre  by</span><span>  the  Troubadours  were  not  given.  It  will  be</span><span>  seen  tltat)the  Bollringers  will  have  au  entirely</span><span>  new  programme  to-night.  Mr.  M'Lean  lias</span><span>  closed  the  Theatre  for  this  evening  to  give  tho</span><span>  Juveniles  an  opportunity  of  hearing  the  bells</span><span>  and  there  will  doubtless  be  a  good</span><span>  house.  On  Friday  evening  the  Troubadours,</span><span>  assisted  by  the  full  strength  of  the</span><span>  Garrick  Amateurs,  will  play  ""Conrad</span><span>  and  Lisette  ""  in  full,  in  aid  of  thc  funds  of  the</span><span>  Hospital.  Considerable  pains  have  been  taken</span><span>  at  rehearsals,  and  the  audience  may  expect  a</span><span>  capital  entertainment.  The  gentleman  who</span><span>  so  successfully  played  Conrad  on  its  last  re-</span><span>  presentation  will  also  take  the  character  on</span><span>  Friday.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  sittings  of  the  Circuit  Court,  in  its</span><span>  criminal  jurisdiction,  were  resumed  yesterday</span><span>  morning,  before  his  Honor  Mr.  Justice</span><span>  Sheppard.  The  case  of  Johnny  alias  Eroora,</span><span>  a  Polynesian,  charged  with  the  murder  of</span><span>  CharleB  Andrews,  at  tho  Nive  River,  on  May</span><span>  26,  occupied  the  whole  of  the  day,  and</span><span>  resulted  in  the  prisoner  being  found  guilty  and</span><span>  sentenced  to  death,  the  point  raised  by  Mr.</span><span>  Cooper  for  the  defence,  that  there  was  no  evi-</span><span>  dence  that  the  wounds  discovered  ou  the  body</span><span>  of  Andrews  had  caused  death,  being  reserved</span><span>  for  the  consideration  of  the  full  Court  at  Bris-</span><span>  bane.  The  evidence  was  of  a  purely  circum</span><span>  i  stantial  character,  and  as  link  by  link  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  laug  chain  of  evidence  was  forged  together,</span><span>  great  interest  was  manifested  in  the  proceed-</span><span>  ings.  When  the  jury  returned  with  their</span><span>  verdict,  tho  Court  House  was  inconveniently</span><span>  crowded.

Tho</span><span>  Court  rose  at  nine  o'clock,  and  will  resume</span><span>  proceedings  this  morning  at  ten.</span></p> <p><span>  [  AFTER  tho  Grammar  School  deputation  had</span></p> <p><span>  retired  yesterday,  Mr.  Livermore,  on  behalf</span><span>  of  S  the  Chamber  of  Commerce,  asked  Mr.</span><span>  Griffith  when  he  would  bc  able  to  receive  a</span><span>  deputation  from  that  body.  Mr.  Griffith  said</span><span>  he  intended,  weather  permitting,  to  take  a</span><span>  trip  up  thc  railway  line  to-day,  and  if  he  did</span><span>  so,  he  would  ho  free  to  receive  a  deputation</span><span>  from  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  to-morrow</span></p> <p><span>  (Friday).  He  particularly  wished  to  visit  thc</span><span>  Allenstown  school,  and  hoped  to  do  so  on</span><span>  Friday  morning,  but  he  would  bo  nt  liberty  by</span><span>  noon  on  that  day.  It  was  therefore  under-</span><span>  stood  that  in  thc  event  of  his  going  up  thc</span><span>  linc  to-day  he  would  receive  the  deputation  at</span><span>  noon  to-morrow  ;  but  that,  should  unfavour-</span><span>  able  weather  interfere  with  his  plans  to-day,</span><span>  he  would  require  to  fix  some  other</span><span>  time  for  the  deputation  which  would</span><span>  have  to  bc  decided  according  to  future</span><span>  circumstances.  From  the  state  of  the  weather</span></p> <p><span>  at  thc  time  of  our  going*  to  press  last  night,</span><span>  there  was  every  reason  to  behove  that  thc</span><span>  trip  up  the  line  would  need  to  be  postponed.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  MACROSSAN-  AT  COOKTOWK.-The  hon.</span><span>  member  for  the  Kennedy,  Mr.  Macrossan,</span><span>  addressed  a  very  large  meeting  at  the  Masonic</span><span>  Hall,  Cooktown,  on  the  4th  instant.  The</span><span>  Mayor  of  Cooktown  occupied  the  chair.  Mr.</span><span>  Macrossan  (the  C.  Herald  states)  was</span><span>  enthusiastically  received,  and  spoke  at  con-</span><span>  siderable  length  upon  the  Railway  Policy,</span></p> <p><span>  and  Financial  Separation  of  the  colony.  He</span><span>  also  urged  upon  the  electors  the  necessity  of</span><span>  returning  members  to  Parliament  who  would</span><span>  work  with  him,  and  the  six  other  Northern</span><span>  representatives,  making  in  all  a  party  of  nine</span><span>  to  secure  for  the  North  a  just  share  of  the</span><span>  public  money  expended.  A  motion,  pledging</span><span>  the  meeting  to  support  only  men  who  would</span><span>  join  Mr.  Macrossan  in  the  Northern  party,</span><span>  was  moved  by  Mr.  John  Walsh,  J.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  AUGUST  13,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  new  Loan  Estimate  is  at  length  be-</span><span>  fore  the  country.  It  is  substantially  the</span><span>  same  as  that  foreshadowed  by  the  Trea-</span><span>  surer's  speech  on  Mr.  M'llwraith's  late</span><span>  motion.  The  question  of  policy  has</span><span>  therefore  been  fully  discussed,  and  in</span><span>  whatever  light  the  movement  of  parties  is</span><span>  considered,  it  cannot  be  denied  that  the</span><span>  three  nights  occupied  in  debate  were  use-</span><span>  fully  employed.  Accepting  the  Minis-</span></p> <p><span>  terial  declaration  that  it  has  been  for</span></p> <p><span>  many  weeks  past  their  intention  to  intro-</span><span>  duce  .the  very  loan  estimate  they  have</span><span>  now  tabled,  it  is  certain  that  but  for  Mr.</span><span>  M'llwraith's  motion  the  opportunity</span><span>  would  not  have  been  afforded  for  the</span><span>  question  to  be  exhaustively  discussed.</span><span>  Judging  by  the  Postmaster-General's  pro-</span><span>  ceedings  in  the  Legislative  Council  on</span><span>  Thursday,  it  is  the  desire  of  Ministers  to</span><span>  close  the  session  next  week.  The  pre-</span><span>  sumption  therefore  is,  that  had  financial</span></p> <p><span>  matters  been  allowed  to  drift,  the  Legis-.</span><span>  la'tive  Assembly  would  have  been  re-</span><span>  quired  to  vote  the  new  loan  after  only</span><span>  one  week's  consideration.  The  impro-</span><span>  priety  of  such  a  proceeding  will  be  ob-</span><span>  vious  when  it  is  recollected  that  the</span><span>  amount  of  the  loan  considerably  exceeds</span><span>  the  taxation  revenue  of  the  year,  and</span><span>  that  the  greater  portion  bf  the  session  is</span><span>  always  devoted  to  the  consideration  of</span><span>  Revenue  Estimates.  The  tendency  of</span><span>  late  years  has'  been,  however,  to  surprise</span><span>  honorable  members  with  a  loan  estimate</span><span>  at  the  close  of  the  session,  and  then  try</span><span>  to  make  them  swallow  it  at  a  gulp.</span><span>  Under  such  circumstances  it  is  clearly</span><span>  impossible  for  the  people's  representatives</span><span>  to  control  the  purse-strings,  and  the  way</span><span>  is  open  for  the  manipulation  of  both</span></p> <p><span>  members  and  constituencies  to  an  extent</span><span>  of  which  the  initiated  alone  can  form  an</span><span>  adequate  conception.</span></p> <p><span>  The  late  discussion,  however,  was  of  a</span><span>  purely  abstract  character,  except  in  so</span><span>  far  as  that  had  the  motion  been  carried</span><span>  Ministers  would  have  accepted  it  as</span><span>  proof  of  no  confidence.  It  will  next</span><span>  have  to  be  dealt  with  in  a  concrete</span><span>  form,  and  honorable  members  on  both</span><span>  sides  will  find  themselves  called  to  act</span><span>  under  circumstances  of  great  responsi-</span><span>  bility.  The  new  estimate  is  open  to</span><span>  several  modes  of  treatment.  It  may  be</span><span>  accepted'  or  rejected  in  its  entirety,  or  it</span><span>  may  be  analysed  in  detail,  and  each</span></p> <p><span>  item  be  treated  on  its  individual  merits.</span></p> <p><span>  If  the  former  course  be  adopted</span><span>  honorable  members  would  probably  find</span><span>  themselves  ranked  precisely  as  they</span><span>  appeared  on  the  night  of  the  31st</span><span>  ultimo,  the  only  difference  being  that</span><span>  fewer  votes  would  be  recorded.  But  in</span><span>  the  event  of  each  item  in  the  estimate</span><span>  being  subjected  to  discriminating  treat-</span><span>  ment,  it  is  almost  certain  that,  as  on  most</span><span>  previous  occasions  during  the  session,</span><span>  Ministers  would  find  it  impossible  to</span><span>  cany  their  policy  without  the  aid  of  the</span><span>  Opposition.</span></p> <p><span>  The  late  debate  proved  that  the  points</span><span>  of  difference  between  parties  were  these:</span><span>  Ministers  and  their  followers  objected  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  further  construction  of  trunk  rail-  j</span><span>  ways  at  the  expense  of  the  State,  and</span><span>  required  that  branch  lines  should  be  pro-</span><span>  vided  for  out  of  loan.  The  Opposition</span><span>  contended  that  precedence  should  be</span><span>  given  to  trunk  lines,  and  while  admitting</span><span>  the  necessity  of  transit  facilities  being</span><span>  provided  for  the  agricultural  districts,</span><span>  they  appeared  indisposed  to  apply  bor-</span><span>  rowed  money  to  the  construction  of</span></p> <p><span>  branch  lines  unless  it  could  be  shown</span></p> <p><span>  either  that  they  would  pay  or  that  the</span><span>  revenue  would  be  protected  from  loss.</span><span>  As  to  the  expediency  of  a  loan,  Ministers</span><span>  declared  in  favour  of  obtaining</span><span>  only  one  year's  supply,  with  the  object</span><span>  of  affording  the  newly  elected  House</span><span>  the  opportunity  of  shaping  the  policy</span><span>  of  the  country  on  the  subject  ;  while</span><span>  the  Opposition  insisted  upon  the  adop-</span><span>  tion  of  a  complete  public  works  scheme,</span><span>  and  upon  the  necessity  of  provision</span><span>  being  made  for  three  years  ahead.  Thus,</span></p> <p><span>  we  think,  thc  differences  between  parties</span><span>  are  fairly  stated,  and  the  reader  is  pre-</span><span>  pared  to  judge  whether  or  not  those</span><span>  differences  are  capable  of  reconciliation.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  own  opinion  is  that  the  logical</span><span>  and  constitutional  course  would  be  to</span><span>  remit  the  whole  question  to  thc  con-</span><span>  stituencies  at  the  earliest  practicable</span><span>  moment,  and  this  doctrine  no  one  seems</span><span>  inclined  to  theoretically  dispute.  Hut  it</span><span>  I  is  argued  that  the  exigencies  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  public  service  must  fae  considered,  and</span><span>  that  it  would  be  wiser  for  Parliament  to</span><span>  incur  the  imputation  of  having  acted</span><span>  illogically  or  unconstitutionally  than  that</span><span>  the  public  works  should  come  to  a  stand-</span><span>  still,  or  that  the  inconvenience  of  a</span><span>  December  session  should  be  encoun-</span><span>  tered.  With  the  majorily  it  is  more</span><span>  than  probable  that  these  latter  con-</span><span>  siderations  prevail,  and  that  a  speedy</span><span>  close  of  the  session,  on  any  reasonable</span><span>  terms,  is  deemed  the  most  important  pro-</span></p> <p><span>  blem  now  to  be  solved.  If  such  bc  thc</span><span>  paramount  wish,  honorable  members  had</span><span>  better  make  up  their  minds  to  run  both</span><span>  Revenue  and  Loan  Estimates  through</span></p> <p><span>  this  week.  No  good  object  will  be  served</span><span>  by  a  prolongation  of  the  session,  and</span><span>  the  public  have  already  been  surfeited</span><span>  with  legislative  anomalies  and  inconsis-</span></p> <p><span>  tencies.</span></p> <p><span>  But  public  men  fully  conscious  of  their</span><span>  responsibilities  will  not  readily  assent  to</span><span>  the  adopiion  ot'  so  summary  a  pro-</span><span>  cedure.  Tile  Government  are  at  pre-</span><span>  sent  reposing  upon  the  equivocal  basis  of</span><span>  a  majority  of  one  ;  but  if  both  Revenue</span><span>  and  Loan  Estimates  be  granted  Ministers</span><span>  will  rejoice  in  having  obtained  a  most</span><span>  substantial  vote  of  confidence.  They</span><span>  will  be  able  to  say  that  the  majority  of</span><span>  one  was  shown  on  a  pure  abstraction,</span><span>  and  that  the  whole  House  exhibits  its</span></p> <p><span>  confidence  in  a  practical  form  by  entrust-</span><span>  ing  them  with  two  millions  and  a-half  of</span><span>  money,  and  with  liberty  to  enjoy  a  ten</span><span>  months'  recess.  On  the  other  hand,</span><span>  many  honorable  members  who  have  no</span><span>  confidence  in  the  ability  or  political</span><span>  integrity  of  Ministers  collectively  will</span><span>  hesitate  to  vote  against  these  items,  which</span></p> <p><span>  represent  money  to  be  disbursed  among  j</span></p> <p><span>  their  constituents.  ?  Will  the  honorable</span><span>  member  for  Maranoa,  for  example,</span><span>  venture  to  incur  the  public  obloquy</span><span>  of  negativing  the  item  of  ,£100,000</span></p> <p><span>  for  the  Dalby  and  Roma  railway?:</span><span>  Will  Mr.  Palmer  vote  against  ""  .£5000,</span><span>  Gladstone  Water  Supply,""  Mr.  Macros-</span><span>  san  against  ""  ¿£100,000,  Northern  Rail</span></p> <p><span>  way,""  or  Mr.  Macfarlane  ""  ^200,000,</span><span>  Central  Railway  ?  ""  The  money  is  needed</span><span>  in  each  case,  and  although  these  items.</span><span>  are  strongly  objected  to  by  several  Go-</span><span>  vernment  supporters,  they  will  not  vote</span><span>  against  them  because  it  would  be.uscless</span><span>  to  do  so  without  the  aid  of  the  Apposi-</span><span>  tion,  and  becáuse  to  reject  them  would</span><span>  be  to  displace  the  Ministers  or  bring  the</span><span>  session  to  an  abrupt  termination.  The</span><span>  embarrassment  of  the  Opposition  mem-</span><span>  bers  must  also  be  increased  by  the  cir-</span><span>  cumstance  that  the  £800,000  for  trunk</span><span>  railways  is  appropriated  in  the  teeth  of</span><span>  the  latest  Ministerial  utterances,  and  is</span><span>  substantially  carrying  out  the  Opposition</span><span>  policy  in  regard  to  trunk  lines.  The</span><span>  only  material  difference  between  the  com-</span><span>  petitive  loan  estimates  in  this  respect  is</span><span>  that  Mr.  Dickson  asks  £800,000  for  one</span><span>  year,  and  Mr.  M'llwraith  £1,950,000  for</span></p> <p><span>  three  years.  Under  these  circumstances</span></p> <p><span>  Opposition  members  will  possibly  find  it</span><span>  awkward  to  give  a  vote  which  their  con-</span><span>  stituents  might  be  instructed  to  interpret</span><span>  as  a  refusal  of  the  proverbial  half-loaf,</span><span>  and  a  going  back  with  no  bread.</span></p> <p><span>  In  determining  this  question  it  is  im-</span><span>  portant  to  recollect  that  the  general</span><span>  election  must  either  take  place  before</span><span>  Christmas  or  be  deferred  until  April  or</span><span>  May.  In  the  central  and  northern  dis-</span><span>  tricts,  at  any  rate,  it  would  be  folly  to</span><span>  expect  one-third  of  the  electors  to  vote</span><span>  during  the  rainy  season.  It  is  quite  true</span><span>  that  possibly  there  may  be  no  rain</span><span>  between  December  and  June  to  impede</span><span>  travelling,  but  the  probabilities  all  point</span></p> <p><span>  to  the  recurrence  of  an  old-fashioned</span></p> <p><span>  wet  season  next  year.  After  three  years  ;</span><span>  of  sparse  rainfall  it  may  at  least  be  ex-</span><span>  pected  that  floods  of  greater  or  less</span><span>  severity  will  shortly  be  experienced;</span><span>  Although,  therefore,  a  small  proportion</span><span>  of  qualified  persons  may  be  disfranchised</span><span>  in  October  and  November  through  im-</span><span>  perfect  electoral  rolls,  a  very  much</span><span>  greater  proportion  would  most  likely</span><span>  be  kept  from  the  ballot  box  by  stress  of</span><span>  weather  in  January  or  February.  These</span><span>  considerations  induced  the  Assembly  to</span><span>  provide  for  the  preparation  of  temporary</span><span>  electoral  rolls,  and  no  argument  has  yet</span><span>  been  cited  which  justifies  the  making</span><span>  this,  portion  of  the  new  Electoral  Act  a</span><span>  dead  letter.</span></p> <p><span>  The  issues  involved  in  the  contem-</span></p> <p><span>  plated  proceedings  this  week  are  of  the</span><span>  gravest  possible  character.  A  false  step</span><span>  on  either  side  may  not  only  prove  dis-</span><span>  astrous  in  a  party  sense,  but  may  also</span><span>  throw  the  public  affairs  into  confusion.</span><span>  If  Ministers  can  get  supply,  both  on</span><span>  revenue  and  loan  accounts,  they  will  of</span><span>  course  take  it,  and  falling  back  on  the</span><span>  theory  that  the  country  wants  adminis-</span><span>  tration  rather  than  legislation,  will  find</span><span>  no  difficulty  in  discovering  the  virtue  of</span><span>  a  protracted  recess.  It  is  scarcely</span><span>  possible,  however,  that  this  conclusion</span><span>  will  be  acquiesced  in  by  the  Opposition</span><span>  moiety  of  the  House.  Yet  their  silence</span><span>  since  the  testing  division  will  betaken  to</span><span>  indicate  concurrence,  or  otherwise  a</span><span>  weary  resignation  to  the  decrees  of  fate.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  K  Company  of  Volunteers  meet  for</span><span>  parade  this  evening  at  eight.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  fifty-eighth  monthly  meeting  of  the</span><span>  No.  5  Building  Society,  will  be  held  at  tho</span><span>  Secretary's  office  to-night  at  the  usual  hour.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  connection  witli  the  anniversary  services</span><span>  of  thc  Congregational  Church,  it  is  announced</span><span>  that  a  soiree  will  be  held  this  evening  in  thc</span></p> <p><span>  School  of  Arts.</span></p> <p><span>  TrtE  Police  Magistrate  has  appointed  Henry</span></p> <p><span>  Briilson  a  collector  under  the  Electoral  Act  for</span><span>  that  portion  of  thc  Leichhardt  District  com</span><span>  <  prised  in  tlie  police  district  of  llockhainptou.</span></p> <p><span>  I  TUE  agents  of  the  s.s.

"<p></p> <p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  JANUARY  3,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  Jan  8/78</span></p> <p><span>  Undeterred  by  the  clamour  of  fierce</span><span>  political  strife  which  now  engrosses</span><span>  public  attention  in  Victoria,  Governor</span><span>  Bowen  has  attempted  a  diversion  in</span></p> <p><span>  favour  of  competitive  examinations  for</span></p> <p><span>  candidates  for  the  civil  service.  And  his</span></p> <p><span>  remarks  have  attracted  notice  even  in  Vic-</span></p> <p><span>  toria,  for  the  bureaucratic  burden  is  there</span><span>  assuming  gigantic  proportions.  That</span></p> <p><span>  colony  is  at  present  governed  by  a</span><span>  Radical  Ministry,  professing  to  be  speci-</span><span>  ally  charged  with  the  conservation  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  interests  of  the  masses  ;  but  its</span></p> <p><span>  greatest  achievements  hitherto  have  been</span><span>  the  creation  of  new  appointments,</span><span>  the  liberal  use  of  political  patronage,</span><span>  and  the  addition  of  new  burdens  to  those</span></p> <p><span>  already  borne  by  the  taxpayers.  Sir</span><span>  George  Bowen,  while  pretending  to  be</span><span>  insensible  to  the  distinctive  shades  of</span><span>  political  partizanship,  is  nevertheless  an</span><span>  observant  spectator  of  the  progress  of</span><span>  events,  and  naturally  would  like  to  see</span><span>  the  game  of  constitution-mending  aban-</span><span>  doned  in  favour  of  the  business  of  ad-</span><span>  ministrative  reform.  He  no  doubt  sees</span><span>  that  in  the  absence  of  a  spirit  of  concila-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  and  compromise,  no  possible</span><span>  amendment  of  the  Constitution  Act</span><span>  would  wholly  remove  the  friction  which</span><span>  clogs  the  action  of  the  present  elective</span><span>  bicameral  system.  And  the  way  of  Mr.</span><span>  Berry  in  this  particular  is  beset  with</span><span>  difficulties.  The  Legislative  Council  is</span><span>  not  likely  to  be  induced  to  sign  its  own</span><span>  death-warrant,  or  even  surrender  any  of</span><span>  its  own  statutory  rights  or  privileges.</span></p> <p><span>  And  there  would  be  certain  incon-</span><span>  veniences  in  attempting  to  attain  the</span><span>  desired  end  by  means  of  the  ""revolu-</span><span>  tion  ""  which  Mr.  Berry  threatens.  In</span><span>  the  event  of  a  coup  d'etat  being  ventured</span><span>  upon,  the  representative  of  the  Queen</span><span>  could  no  longer  play  the  part  of  the</span><span>  ""fox  that  had  a  cold;""  he  would  be</span><span>  compelled  to  stand  by  the  constitution,</span><span>  and  insist  upon  the  maintenance  of  law</span><span>  and  order  at  all  risks.  This  would</span><span>  of  course  place  him  in  direct  an-</span><span>  tagonism  to  Mr.  Berry,  and  it  is</span><span>  impossible  to  forecast  the  complications</span><span>  that  might  follow.  Sir  George  Bowen's</span><span>  gubernatorial  successes  have  resulted</span><span>  partly  from  his  policy  of  non-interference,</span><span>  no  doubt,  but  chiefly  from  his  good</span><span>  scoring  as  a  ""show""  Governor.  He  is</span><span>  inimitable  at  after  dinner  speech-making,</span></p> <p><span>  and  to  his  classical  orations  delivered</span><span>  amidst  the  fire  of  champagne  corks  he</span><span>  owes  his  most  signal  triumphs  in  popu-</span><span>  larity-winning.  His  latest  rhetorical</span><span>  effort,  having  for  its  object  the  abolition</span><span>  of  patronage,  is  a  step  in  the  right</span><span>  direction,  and  it  would  be  a  solid</span><span>  gain  to  the  people  of  Victoria</span><span>  if  they  would  adopt  their  Governor's  ad-</span><span>  vice,  and  relegate  constitutional  changes</span><span>  to  that  distant  future  when  necessary</span><span>  practical  reforms  have  all  been  carried</span></p> <p><span>  into  effect.  It  is  no  answer  to  say  that</span><span>  while  in  Queensland  Sir  George  was  ad-</span><span>  dicted  to  the  questionable  exercise  of</span><span>  back-stairs  influence.  Indeed,  the  very</span><span>  fact  that  he  has  been  tempted  to  stoop</span><span>  to  furtive  practices  may  have  intensified</span><span>  the  conviction  in  his  mind  that  ill-</span><span>  regulated  patronage  is  an  evil  from  which</span><span>  any  people  may  well  pray  to  be  deli-</span></p> <p><span>  vered.  He  has  nothing  to  gain  by  the</span><span>  suggested  reforms,  except  perhaps  some</span><span>  deserved  credit  for  repeatedly  directing</span><span>  public  attention  to  their  necessity,  and</span><span>  for  citing  the  example  of  the  mother</span></p> <p><span>  country  in  proof  that  the  competitive</span><span>  examination  system  is  not  a  merely</span><span>  theoretical  conception,  but  a  practical</span><span>  and  realised  entity.</span></p> <p><span>  We  can  conceive  of  nothing  in  the</span><span>  functions  of  a  high-principled  Minister</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  Crown  more  perplexing  and</span><span>  at  times  humiliating,  than  the  right</span><span>  exercise  of  patronage.  There  are</span><span>  so  many  tempations  to  make</span><span>  it  a  marketable  article  that  its</span><span>  pure  dispensation  is  almost  impossible.</span><span>  There  are  not  only  clamorous  electors  to</span><span>  the  pacified,  but  members  of  Parliament</span><span>  to  he  bought.  Ministers  in  this  colony</span><span>  may  not  adopt  the  phrase  that  ""  to  the</span><span>  victors  belong  the  spoils,""  but  they  do</span><span>  unblushingly  confess  that  ""we  reserve</span><span>  these  appointments  for  our  friends.""</span><span>  Even  so  philosophical  and  pure-</span><span>  minded  a  man  as  Mr.  Glad-</span><span>  stone  has  affirmed  that  while</span></p> <p><span>  patronage  is  vested  in  Ministers  they  are</span><span>  justified  in  giving  the  preference  to  their</span><span>  friends.  Suppose  two  candidates  for  an</span><span>  appointment  equal  in  every  other  re-</span><span>  spect,  the  politician  would  naturally</span><span>  select  the  man  of  correct  principles</span><span>  rather  than  the  man  obviously  heterdox</span><span>  upon  fundamental  questions.  It  may  be</span><span>  admitted  that  preference  might  be  fairly</span><span>  exercised  to  such  an  extent,  and  that</span><span>  were  theory  and  practice  harmonious  in</span></p> <p><span>  this  particular  there  would  be  little</span><span>  ground  for  complaint.  But  in  real  life</span></p> <p><span>  everybody  knows  that  abuse  of  patronage</span><span>  is  the  rule,  and  that  the  State  is  rarely</span><span>  successful  in  procuring  the  services  of</span><span>  the  most  fit  man.  Thus  the  evils  of</span></p> <p><span>  patronage  as  at  present  exercised  are</span><span>  manifold.  lt  demoralises  politicians,  often</span><span>  keeps  untrustworthy  Ministers  in  office,</span><span>  and  impairs  the  efficiency  of  the  public</span></p> <p><span>  service.</span></p> <p><span>  Politicians  are  demoralised  in  this</span><span>  wise.  Ministers  hold  their  posts  during</span><span>  the  pleasure  of  a  fluctuating  majority.</span><span>  They  are  often  dependent  upon  the</span><span>  votes  of  those  plundering  and  blundering</span><span>  representatives  who  are  commonly  dis-</span><span>  tinguished  as  ""  rail-sitters.""  These  are</span><span>  men  who  do  not  always  rise  to  the</span><span>  questionable  dignity  of  ""log-rollers.""</span><span>  They  are  political  hawks  who</span><span>  sit  aloft  ever  watchful  for  oppor-</span><span>  tunities  to  pluck  the  plums  out  of</span><span>  the  public  pudding.  They  have  always</span></p> <p><span>  some  parasite  whose  animal  cravings</span><span>  must  be  satisfied.  So,  whenever  Minis-</span></p> <p><span>  ters  are  doubtful  of  a  majority  in  some</span></p> <p><span>  important  division,  the  rail-sitting</span><span>  fraternity  discover  undue  tenderness  of</span><span>  conscience.  They  cannot  see  how  to</span><span>  vote  with  Ministers  on  this  particular</span><span>  question,  but  yet  would  regret  to  vote</span><span>  against  them,  if  for  no  other  reason  than</span><span>  that  they  are  a  Liberal  Ministry.  The</span><span>  whipper-in  has  no  difficulty  in  arriving  at</span><span>  a  diagnosis  in  these  cases,  and  soon  dis-</span><span>  covers  that  each  member  has  a  nephew  or</span></p> <p><span>  electioneering  agent  still  unprovided  for,</span></p> <p><span>  and  that  the  Government  have  not  seen</span></p> <p><span>  their  way  to  billet  the  incompetent  or</span><span>  worthless  person  on  the  public  service.</span><span>  The  debate  is  protracted  because  the</span><span>  result  of  the  division  is  doubtful  until,</span><span>  by-and-bye,  one  or  more  of  the  rail-</span></p> <p><span>  sitters  is  button-holed  by  a  Premier  or  an</span><span>  Attorney-General.  Suddenly  a  rising</span><span>  speaker  is  met  by  calls  for  a  division</span><span>  from  the  Treasury  Bench,  and  Ministers</span><span>  take  their  places  with  a  smile.  The  rail-</span><span>  sitter  has  got  his  price,  the  taxpayer  has</span><span>  been  swindled,  and  a  corrupt  Ministry</span><span>  has  acquired  a  new  lease  of  power.  No</span><span>  representative  chamber  is  free  from</span><span>  trafficking  members,  and  scarcely  any</span></p> <p><span>  Cabinet  but  has  at  least  one</span></p> <p><span>  colleague  prepared  to  secure  an  extended</span><span>  tenure  of  office  by  purchasing  support</span><span>  with  State  money.  The  transaction  is</span></p> <p><span>  of  course  managed  furtively,  and  the</span><span>  negociating  Minister  does  not  let  his  left</span><span>  hand  know  what  his  right  hand  doeth.</span></p> <p><span>  But  the  system  is  a  blot  upon  our  civili-</span><span>  sation,  and  a  source  of  festering  corrup-</span><span>  tion.  By  all  means,  then,  let  it  be</span><span>  abolished  in  Queensland  at  once  and</span><span>  for  ever.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Visiting  Committee  to  the  Hospital  for</span><span>  the  month  of  January,  1878,  consist  of  the</span><span>  following  gentlemen  :—Messrs.  Joseph  Brown,</span><span>  R.L.Dibdin,  and  Dr.McNeely.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  friends  of  Mr.  Robert  Ballard,  Chief</span><span>  Engineer,  Northern  Railway,  will  be  glad  to</span></p> <p><span>  learn  that  he  is  now  a  member  of  the  Institute</span></p> <p><span>  of  Civil  Engineers,  having  been  transferred</span></p> <p><span>  from  the  class  of  associate  to  that  of  member</span><span>  a  few  weeks  since.  This  is  a  recognition  of</span></p> <p><span>  merit  which  everyone  who  has  watched  Mr.</span><span>  Ballard's  career  must  admit  to  have  been  well</span></p> <p><span>  earned.</span></p> <p><span>  A  FINE  rain  set  in  last  night  shortly  before</span></p> <p><span>  nine  o'clock.  It  was  preceded  by  the  usual</span></p> <p><span>  storm  indications.  As  the  light  faded  in  the</span><span>  western  heavens,  cumulus  ""masses""  of  inky-</span></p> <p><span>  looking  clouds  made  their  appearance,  coming</span></p> <p><span>  up  against  a  southerly  breeze,  and  gradually</span></p> <p><span>  overspreading  the  sky.  There  was  a  great</span><span>  deal  of  lightning,  but  very  little  thunder.</span><span>  The  rain  was  heralded  by  a  dust  storm,  which</span><span>  swept  along  the  streets  in  blinding  clouds—a</span></p> <p><span>  feature  quite  unexpected,  considering  that</span></p> <p><span>  fully  an  inch  and  a-half  of  rain  fell  only  the</span><span>  night  before.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Town  and  Country  Journal  of  the  1st</span><span>  instant  has  a  map  supplement,  an  advance</span><span>  copy  of  which  came  to  hand  by  the  last  mail.</span><span>  The  supplement  embraces  a  large  coloured</span></p> <p><span>  map  of  New  South  Wales,  with  plans  of  Port</span><span>  Jackson  and  Newcastle  harbours,  and  some</span><span>  descriptive  letter-press  giving  a  careful  digest</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  history  and  statistics  of  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  The  engraver  and  lithographer  have  both  done</span><span>  their  work  well,  producing  one  of  the  clearest</span><span>  and  best  executed  maps  we  have  seen.  The</span><span>  colouring,  which  is  most  tasteful,  is  designed</span><span>  to  indicate  the  chief  agricultural  and  mineral-</span><span>  ogical  features  of  the  most  populous  districts,</span><span>  such,  for  example,  as  the  mines  hitherto  dis-</span><span>  covered,  the  vine,  sugar,  and  tobacco-growing</span><span>  districts,  the  situation  of  the  principal  vine-</span><span>  yards  and  sugar-mills,  the  coal  and  gold-fields,</span><span>  &c.  The  proprietors  could  not  well  have  given</span><span>  a  more  valuable  or  better  got  up  supplement,</span><span>  and  there  is  sure  to  be  a  run  upon  the  first</span><span>  number  of  the  journal  for  the  present  year.</span></p> <p><span>  A  LIST  of  the  contractors  for  the  country</span><span>  mail  service  this  year  has  been  published,  and</span></p> <p><span>  in  our  own  district  there  has  been  an  entire</span><span>  change  excepting  in  one  instance—we  refer  to</span><span>  the  ordinary  service  to  Gladstone.  The  fol-</span><span>  lowing  are  the  local  services,  with  the  names</span><span>  of  the  successful  tenderers  :  For  Rockhampton</span><span>  Post-office  and  Railway  Station,  James  Cal-</span><span>  laghan  ;  Rockhampton  and  St.  Lawrence,</span><span>  John  Heliron  ;  Rockhampton  and  Emu  Park,</span><span>  R.  Johnson  ;  Rockhampton  and  Crocodile</span><span>  Creek,  Frederick  Graham  ;  Rockhampton  and</span><span>  Leura,  T.  and  A.  Rutherford  ;  Rockhampton</span><span>  and  Toorilla,  Edmund  Johnston  ;  Gladstone  and</span><span>  Rockhampton  (special  service),  Barney  Butler.</span><span>  The  contract  for  the  ordinary  service  between</span><span>  Gladstone  and  Rockhampton  has  still  a  year</span><span>  to  run,  and  therefore  remains  undisturbed  ;</span><span>  the  special  service  has  been  organised  merely</span><span>  to  carry  the  English  mail,  and  is  thus</span><span>  monthly.  The  wholesale  retirement  of  the  old</span><span>  contractors  from  the  service  is  doubtless  owing,</span><span>  in  some  instances,  to  the  raising  of  the  tenders,</span><span>  while  the  new  comers  kept  down  the  price.</span><span>  However  that  may  be,  the  change  is  a  sweeping</span></p> <p><span>  one.</span></p> <p><span>  NOTWITHSTANDING;  the  threatening  aspect</span><span>  of  the  weather  last  night,  the  Rockhampton</span><span>  Blondin  ascended  to  the  landing  stage  and</span><span>  stepped  on  to  the  rope.  This  was  about  half-</span><span>  past  eight,  and  a  considerable  number  of</span><span>  persons  were  assembled  below,  the  takings  for</span><span>  admission  amounting  to  £9  16s.  The  lad</span><span>  made  his  way  along  the  rope  as  usual,</span><span>  and  was  within  about  three  yards  of</span><span>  the  landing,  when  a  squall—the  first</span><span>  outbreak  of  a  storm  that  had  been  brew-</span><span>  ing  for  some  time—struck  the  marquee,  tore</span><span>  away  some  of  the  guys,  and  liberated  one  of</span><span>  the  supports,  which  fell  against  the  rope—</span><span>  causing  a  violent  jerk,  and  rendering  it  very</span><span>  difficult  for  the  performer  to  maintain  his</span><span>  footing.  The  balancing-pole  was  shaken</span><span>  from  his  grasp  and  fell  to  the  ground  ;</span><span>  and  for  several  minutes  he  stood  still  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  rope,  unable  to  take  a  single  step  forward,</span><span>  owing  to  the  vibration  and  the  violence  of</span><span>  the  wind.  Fortunately,  he  can  walk  without</span><span>  a  balancing-pole,  and  he  says  that  he  held  on  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  rope  by  his  toes.  He  will  perform  this</span><span>  evening,  weather  permitting.</span></p> <p><span>  It  will  be  observed  that  the  English  mail</span><span>  per  Torres  Straits  steamer  closes  at  nine</span><span>  o'clock  to-morrow  (Friday)  morning.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  attendance  of  local  magistrates  is  re-</span><span>  quested  at  a  general  meeting  to  be  held  at  the</span><span>  Court-house,  Rockhampton,  on  Tuesday  next  at</span><span>  noon.

The  handicaps  having  been  de-</span><span>  clared,  the  players  cast  lots  for  opponents,</span><span>  and  each  player  then  played  300  up.  In  the</span><span>  first  game  the  gentleman  who  conceded  seventy-</span></p> <p><span>  five  to  his  antagonist  won  by  sixty-three</span></p> <p><span>  points,  the  scores  being  304  and  237.

On  Tuesday,  the  artificial  scents</span><span>  were  partly  neutralised  by  the  ""scrub</span><span>  stench""  which  sometimes  makes  itself  power-</span><span>  fully  felt  during  our  summer  thunder-weather,</span><span>  but  we  cannot  say  that  the  change  was  an</span><span>  improvement.  In  our  correspondence  column</span><span>  two  writers  make  complaints  to-day,  which</span><span>  ought  to  receive  attention  from  the</span><span>  Inspector  of  Nuisances.  And  we  may</span><span>  add  another,  which  is  that  the  so-called</span><span>  earth  closets  are  allowed  to  become  a  complete</span><span>  farce,  because  dry  earth  is  never  supplied,  and</span><span>  the  result  is  that  the  earth  closet  is  a  greater</span><span>  nuisance  than  the  cesspit.  As  to  the  night-cart</span></p> <p><span>  nuisance,  we  are  enabled  to  state,  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  authority  of  Dr.  Callaghan,  that  at  a  merely</span><span>  nominal  expense  night-soil  might  he  rendered</span><span>  almost  entirely  inodorous.  If  so,  the  Corpora-</span><span>  tion  would  do  well  to  at  once  pass  a  bye-law</span><span>  on  the  subject.  On  some  evenings  the  odour</span><span>  is  so  offensive  from  passing  night-carts  that</span><span>  members  of  our  staff  have  had  to  rush  incon-</span><span>  tinently  into  the  street,  and  make  for  some</span><span>  spot  to  wind-ward  of  the  pot-pourri.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  members  of  the  Rockhampton  Amateur</span><span>  Dramatic  Club  met  last  night  at  thc  Com-</span><span>  mercial  Hotel,  East-street,  for  the  purpose  of</span><span>  acknowledging  the  valuable  services  lately</span><span>  rendered  to  them  by  Mr.  Dan  Briggs.  There</span><span>  was  a  good  attendance.  Mr.  Ernest  Milford,</span><span>  in  a  few  well  chosen  remarks,  thanked</span><span>  Mr.  Briggs,  on  behalf  of  the  club,</span><span>  for  his  services,  he  having  materially  assisted</span><span>  in  getting  up  the  recent  Amateur  Christy</span><span>  Minstrel  entertainment,  which  was  held  on</span><span>  the  20th  ultimo,  in  aid  of  the  funds  of  the</span><span>  Benevolent  Asylum.  It  will  be  remembered</span><span>  that  the  affair  proved  most  successful  ;  all</span><span>  worked  with  a  will,  and  Mr.  Briggs  brought</span><span>  his  experience  and  ability  to  bear  in  perfecting</span><span>  the  arrangements.  Having  expressed  the  unani-</span><span>  mous  feeling  of  his  associates  in  the  matter,  Mr.</span><span>  Milford  handed  Mr.  Briggs  a  written  address</span><span>  conveying  the  thanks  of  the  club,  and  signed</span><span>  by  the  members.  He  also  begged  his</span><span>  acceptance  of  a  handsome  writing  desk.  Mr.</span><span>  Briggs,  in  a  few  appropriate  remarks,  thanked</span><span>  the  members  for  their  kind  acknowledgments,</span><span>  stating  that  he  would  be  most  happy,  at  any</span><span>  future  time,  to  assist  in  promoting  the</span><span>  interests  of  the  club  and  its  charitable  objects.</span><span>  So  ended  this  pleasant  little  affair,  creditable</span></p> <p><span>  to  all  concerned.</span></p> <p><span>  Two  valuable  horses,  thc  property  of  Messrs.</span><span>  Cameron  and  Crombie,  of  Kensington  Downs,</span><span>  arrived  here  on  Tuesday  morning  by  the  James</span><span>  Paterson  from  Sydney,  and  will  be  sent  on  to</span><span>  the  station  next  week.

The  second,  Muir  Lad,  is  a</span><span>  pure-bred  imported  Clydesdale  stallion,  bred</span><span>  by  Mr.  Mather,  Bonnington  Moor  ;  got  by</span><span>  Pride  of  Scotland  (who  has  gained  many  prizes</span><span>  in  Scotland):  dam,  Mr.  Mather's  prize  mare</span><span>  Jess  (the  flower  of  Eaglesham,  who  took  first</span><span>  prizes  too  numerous  to  specify)  ;  her  sire  was</span><span>  Premier,  a  celebrated  breeding  horse  in  Ren-</span><span>  frewshire.  Muir  Lad  took  first  prize  in  his</span><span>  class  at  the  Grand  National  Show,  Melbourne,</span><span>  1872  ;  also  first  prize  at  the  Victorian  Agri-</span><span>  cultural  Society's  Show,  1875  ;  and  was</span><span>  purchased  by  Mr.  Town  for  the  sum  of  £1000.</span><span>  At  the  Sydney  Exhibition  of  1876,  Muir  Lad</span><span>  took  first  prize  for  the  best  imported  draught</span><span>  stallion  ;  also  the  special  cup  for  the  best</span><span>  draught  stallion,  any  age  ;  and  also  the  cham-</span><span>  pion  cup  for  the  best  male  exhibit  on  the</span><span>  ground.  At  the  Sydney  Exhibition  of  1877,</span><span>  Muir  Lad  took  first  prize  for  best  heavy</span><span>  draught  Stallion  ;  and  champion  cup  for  the</span><span>  best  male  animal  on  ground  in  cart  sections.</span></p> <p><span>  The  American  locomotive  has  been  tried</span></p> <p><span>  over  the  Blue  Mountains  with  satisfactory</span></p> <p><span>  results.</span></p> <p><span>  GYMPIE  CRUSHINGS.—The  following  recent</span><span>  crushings  are  reported  :—230  tons  of  stone  from</span><span>  the  United  Smithfield  yielded  164  ozs.  of  gold.  51</span><span>  tons  of  stone  from  Nos.  3  and  4  North  Lady</span><span>  Mary  Reef  has  yielded  646  ounces  of  gold.  140</span><span>  tons  of  stone  from  No.  8  South  Lady  Mary</span><span>  Reef  have  yielded  418  ounces  of  gold.  48</span><span>  tons  of  stone  from  No.  5  South  Lady  Mary</span><span>  Reef  has  yielded  178  ounces  of  gold.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  KIDNAPPING  CASE.—A  Melbourne</span></p> <p><span>  telegram  in  the  Brisbane  Telegraph  says  :—</span><span>  lt  is  reported  that  a  faint  clue  has  been  found</span><span>  which  may  lead  to  the  discovery  of  the</span><span>  woman  who  stole  the  baby  belonging  to  Mr.</span><span>  Potts,  at  Fitzroy.

The  woman  answered  the</span><span>  description  of  the  one  who  stole  the  child.</span><span>  The  woman  said  to  the  girl  Condor,  ""I  have</span><span>  stolen  this  child  from  a  nurse  girl,  and  the</span><span>  detectives  are  after  me.''  She  then  requested</span><span>  the  girl,  Janet  Condor,  to  take  thc  child,</span></p> <p><span>  which  she  refused  to  do.  The  woman  then</span><span>  assaulted  her,  and  followed  her  some  distance.</span><span>  She  told  her  she  was  going  to  persons  in  Bed-</span><span>  ford-street,  Collingwood,  and  that  afterwards</span><span>  she  would  go  to  Kellet's  house  on  Clifton  Hill.</span><span>  The  girl  asked  the  woman  where  she  resided,</span><span>  and  she  said  in  a  two-roomed  house  in  York-</span></p> <p><span>  street,  Emerald  Hill,  and  again  repeated  that</span><span>  she  had  stolen  the  child,  but  on  no  account</span><span>  would  give  it  up  to  thc  police.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  JANUARY  4,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  PHILOSOPHICAL  politicians  are  fond  of</span><span>  reiterating  that  representative  govern-</span><span>  ment  is  on  its  trial,  that  party  govern-</span><span>  ment  is  becoming  a  thing  of  the  past,</span><span>  and  that  the  inevitable  tendency  of</span><span>  political  morals  under  universal  suffrage</span><span>  is  of  a  retrograde  character.  There  is</span><span>  some  truth  in  all  this,  but  it  is  not  the</span><span>  whole  truth.  In  the  Australian  Colonies</span></p> <p><span>  time  has  not  been  allowed  for  the  proper</span><span>  working  of  the  experimental  constitu-</span><span>  tions  severally  conferred  upon  them</span><span>  within  the  past  quarter  of  a  century.</span><span>  It  is  perfectly  natural  that  each</span><span>  colony  having  its  own  distinctive</span><span>  system  all  should  not  work  well  alike,  and</span><span>  that  all  should  be  found  to  need  more  or</span><span>  less  amendment.  In  each  colony  con-</span><span>  stitutional  reform  has  been  a  standing</span><span>  cry  with  one  section  of  its  politicians.</span><span>  In  Victoria  it  is  a  manifestly  popular</span><span>  demand,  and  one  which  a  very  large</span><span>  majority  of  the  public  men  of  that</span><span>  colony  deem  necessary.  But  reform  has</span><span>  hitherto  been  found  impossible  because</span><span>  nothing  less  than  some  violent  or</span><span>  radical  change  seemed  acceptable  to  the</span><span>  constitution-menders.  In  the  other</span><span>  colonies  the  reforms  aimed  at  have  not</span><span>  been  fundamental,  and  in  several  of  them</span><span>  they  have  been  successfully  carried.  The</span><span>  most  important  changes  have  been  made</span><span>  in  New  Zealand,  but  these  were</span><span>  in  a  direction  in  which  it  is</span><span>  seldom  difficult  to  legislate.  For-</span><span>  merly  a  large  share  of  the  legislative</span><span>  business  was  delegated  to  the  provincial</span><span>  councils.  The  supreme  legislature  has</span><span>  now  simply  withdrawn  the  powers  so  dele-</span><span>  gated,  and  arrogated  them  to  itself.  A</span><span>  legislature  is  always  disposed  to  extend</span><span>  the  sphere  of  its  influence,  but  is  seldom</span><span>  willing  to  contract  it.  That  is  the  true</span><span>  reason  why  constitutional  reform  is  found</span><span>  so  difficult  in  Victoria,  and  why  local</span><span>  government  has  never  been  made  a  press-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  public  question  in  Queensland.  Every-</span><span>  body  admits  the  desirableness  of  some</span><span>  change  in  both  cases,  but  the  unwillingness</span><span>  to  relinquish  power  is  always  displayed</span><span>  when  practical  legislation  is  attempted.</span></p> <p><span>  In  Victoria  both  parties  have  heen  at</span><span>  different  times  baulked  by  an  obstructive</span><span>  Upper  House,  and  the  leaders  on  each</span><span>  side  have  publicly  declared  that  until</span><span>  some  means  is  found  of  making  the</span><span>  Legislative  Council  more  amenable  to</span><span>  public  opinion  it  is  hopeless  to  attempt</span><span>  legislation  on  many  questions  urgently</span><span>  demanding  a  solution.  In  1866  Sir</span><span>  James  M'Culloch  resigned  while  possess-</span><span>  ing  a  large  majority  in  the  Assembly,</span><span>  avowedly  because  of  the  hostile  altitude</span><span>  of  the  Council  ;  and  in  1878  Mr.  Berry</span><span>  will  probably  find  himself  compelled  to</span><span>  follow  Sir  James'  example,  or  advise  a</span><span>  dissolution.  That  he  would  at  once  ap-</span><span>  peal  to  the  constituencies  is  certain,  but</span></p> <p><span>  for  the  awkward  circumstance  that  the</span><span>  moment  the  current  session  ends,  pay-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  of  members  will  cease  to  be  the</span></p> <p><span>  law  of  the  land.  So  he  has  taken  a  pro-</span><span>  longed  adjournment,  in  the  hope  that</span><span>  something  in  the  chapter  of  accidents</span><span>  will  enable  him  to  avert  the  difficulty.</span><span>  The  majority  clearly  do  not  want  a  dissolu-</span><span>  tion,  for  they  have  each  a  claim  of  £300</span><span>  against  the  country,  and  the  hope  of  its</span><span>  being  met  would  be  small  indeed  were</span><span>  they  relegated  to  obscurity  by  a  contested</span><span>  election.  Thus  the  Council  remains</span></p> <p><span>  master  of  the  situation,  and  Mr.  Berry's</span><span>  followers  can  do  nothing  but  bawl  and</span></p> <p><span>  storm,  and  openly  advocate  a  revolution.</span></p> <p><span>  When  Victoria  obtained  an  elective</span></p> <p><span>  Upper  House,  the  popular  belief  was</span></p> <p><span>  that  it  had  secured  a  more  liberal  and</span><span>  democratic  constitution  than  those</span></p> <p><span>  colonies  enjoyed  which  had  but  one  repre-</span><span>  sentative  chamber.  But  experience  has</span><span>  shown  that  the  Crown  is  far  less  conser-</span><span>  vative  than  the  territorial  aristocracy.</span><span>  King  William's  action  in  the  matter  of</span><span>  the  English  Reform  Bill  of  1832  was</span></p> <p><span>  directly  in  accord  with  the  popular  will,</span></p> <p><span>  and  as  directly  antagonistic  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  hereditary  land-owning  class.  And</span><span>  so  it  would  be  found  in  Victoria,</span><span>  If  the  Council  were  composed  of  Crown</span><span>  nominees,  the  process  of  swamping</span><span>  would  form  the  safety  valve  to  the</span><span>  constitution.  At  present  no  power</span></p> <p><span>  on  earth  short  of  brute  force  can</span></p> <p><span>  override  the  Upper  House.  With  their</span><span>  backs  against  the  Constitution  Act  their</span><span>  position  is  impregnable,  and  they  can</span><span>  only  be  approached  by  diplomacy.</span><span>  This  is  an  anomalous  condition  of  affairs,</span><span>  and  one  which  should  be  altered,  for</span><span>  no  single  House  of  Legislature  ought  to</span><span>  be  empowered  to  block  reforms  and  bring</span><span>  the  governmental  machinery  to  a  dead-</span><span>  lock.  No  doubt  the  Council  have  been</span><span>  aggravated  into  assuming  their  present</span><span>  position,  and  would  be  willing  to  listen</span><span>  to  any  fair  proposal  by  way  of  compro-</span><span>  mise.  But  it  is  certainly  a  defect  in  the</span><span>  constitution  that  there  is  no  legal  way  of</span><span>  dealing  with  them  if  they  prove  obstre-</span><span>  perous.  The  Assembly  would  be  at  once</span><span>  dissolved  by  the  advice  of  Ministers,  if</span><span>  accompanied  by  reasonable  grounds,  but</span><span>  there  is  no  getting  at  the  Council  until</span><span>  their  time  of  service  expires.  The  ex-</span><span>  istence  of  such  a  body  is  injurious  in  two</span><span>  ways.  It  blocks  wise  reforms  with  oc-</span><span>  casional  deadlocks,  and  it  tends  to  make</span><span>  the  Lower  House  more  radical  than  it</span><span>  otherwise  would  be.  Whenever  the</span><span>  Upper  House  becomes  obstructive,  the</span><span>  obvious  effect  upon  the  popular  constitu-</span></p> <p><span>  encies  is  to  make  them  return  extreme</span><span>  men  to  the  Assembly,  as  a  sort  of  coun-</span><span>  terpoise  to  the  irreconcilables  in  the</span><span>  Council.  Hence  the  incompatibilities  so</span><span>  frequently  displayed  of  late,and  the  steady</span><span>  deterioration  in  the  quality  of  politicians</span><span>  in  the  popular  chamber.</span></p> <p><span>  The  various  schemes  launched  in  Vic-</span></p> <p><span>  toria  for  reforming  the  Upper  House</span><span>  have  all  attempted  too  much.  Mr.</span><span>  Francis'  Norwegian  system  is  a  case  in</span><span>  point.  It  is  by  no  radical  changes  that</span><span>  our  system  of  government  can  be  im-</span><span>  proved  ;  but  by  a  loyal  adherence  to</span><span>  constitutional  principles  and  precedents,</span><span>  by  accepting  reform  by  instalments,  and</span><span>  by  the  manifestation  of  a  conciliatory</span><span>  spirit  towards  opponents  whenever  great</span><span>  principles  are  at  stake.  The  practice  of</span><span>  the  reformer  should  be,  if  he  cannot</span><span>  obtain  all  he  asks,  to  take  all  he  can  get.</span><span>  Far  more  progress  will  be  made  by</span><span>  smoothing  over  difficulties  in  the  working</span><span>  of  our  legislative  machinery  than  by</span><span>  aspiring  after  a  theoretical  perfection</span></p> <p><span>  which  will  never  be  attained  in  the  actual</span><span>  conduct  of  human  affairs.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Fitzroy  Lodge  of  Good  Templars  meet</span><span>  to-night  in  the  Oddfellows'  Hall  at  7.45  p.m.</span><span>  Important  matters  will  be  brought  before  the</span></p> <p><span>  members.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Police  Magistrate  will  hold  an  enquiry</span><span>  in  the  Court  House  this  afternoon,  at  three</span><span>  o'clock,  into  the  circumstances  attending  the</span><span>  death  of  Mrs.  Watson,  who  died  suddenly  at</span><span>  the  Hospital  on  Monday  last.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  have  had  a  visit  from  Schafer,  the  great</span><span>  traveller,  who  is  now  in  town.  His  story  is</span><span>  that  he  left  his  home,  in  Germany,  nineteen</span><span>  years  ago,  determined  not  to  return  until  he</span><span>  had  visited  every  country  on  the  face  of  the</span><span>  earth.  He  has  been  to  a  great  many  already  ;</span><span>  but  New  Guinea,  Java,  Russian  Asia,  and</span><span>  Siberia,  are  still  ahead,  and  tempt  him  on-</span></p> <p><span>  ward.  He  has  had  introductions  to  all  sorts</span><span>  of  people,  whose  autographs  he  managed  to</span><span>  secure;  and  on  his  return  home  he  intends</span><span>  publishing  an  account  of  his  travels.  He  is</span><span>  now  making  acquaintances  here.</span></p> <p><span>  THERE  was  a  great  crowd  at  the  ""Euro-</span><span>  pean  ""  rooms  last  night  to  witness  the  conclu-</span><span>  sion  of  the  great  billiard  match.  The  gentle-</span><span>  man  who  received  the  200  points  start,  by</span><span>  careful  play  managed  to  keep  his  lead  for  a</span><span>  considerable  time,  the  balls  breaking  badly</span><span>  for  his  opponent.  Soon  after  the  first  hun-</span><span>  dred  had  been  played,  however,  the  superior</span><span>  play  of  the  man  handicapped  began  to  tell  its</span><span>  tale,  and  he  rapidly  made  up  for  lost  time,  the</span><span>  game  at  the  interval  being  245  and  353.</span><span>  On  resuming  play  the  former  gentleman</span><span>  speedily  lessened  the  gap,  and  continued</span><span>  gaining  on  his  opponent  until  the  game  stood</span><span>  456  all.  From  this  to  the  finish  of  the  game</span><span>  the  excitement  was  intense,  each  player  lead-</span><span>  ing  in  turn  by  a  few  points.  Luck,  however,</span><span>  eventually  favoured  the  best  player,  and  he  won</span><span>  a  well-contested  game  by  three,  amidst  great</span><span>  excitement  and  cheering.  The  prize,  a  very</span><span>  handsome  silver  cup,  valued  at  £20,  was  then</span><span>  handed  to  the  victor  by  Host  Flynn,  and</span><span>  suitably  acknowledged  by  the  recipient.</span></p> ",Article,1878-01-04,"The Morning Bulletin.

At  a  banquet  given  recently  on</span><span>  the  occasion  of  the  turning  of  the  first</span><span>  sod  of  the  railway  from  Port  Augusta</span><span>  northwards,  Sir  William  said  :—</span></p> <p><span>  You  will  find  that  country  will  be  opened  up</span><span>  which  is  at  present  barren  and  unoccupied.</span><span>  You  will  get  gradually  into  country influenced</span><span>  by  tropical  rains  ;  and  you  must  go  on,  not</span><span>  stopping  at  the  two  hundred  and  fourteen</span><span>  miles  already  constructed,  but  till  you  get to</span></p> <p><span>  the  point  I  have  mentioned  ;  and  having got</span><span>  there,  you  must  proceed  till  you  get  to another</span><span>  district  altogether—a  district  where  you  can</span><span>  have  a  large  population—where  you  can  grow</span><span>  sugar,  tobacco,  and  the  rest  of  the produce</span><span>  grown  in  tropical  regions  with  which  this rail-</span><span>  way  will  communicate.  Now  I  venture  to  &nbsp;</span><span>  say  there  is  a  case  made  out  for  a  transcon-</span><span>  tinental  line.  I  know  it  is  said  it  will  go</span><span>  through  a  desert  to  nowhere.  I  think  it  is</span><span>  Trollope  who  says  that,  but  I  venture to</span><span>  question  his  premises.  In  the  first  place  it  is</span><span>  not  a  desert,  and  in  the  second  place  it  goes</span><span>  everywhere.  The  country  is  not  a  desert,  as</span><span>  I  have  just  now  shown  ;  and  as  far  as going</span><span>  nowhere,  I  think  if  the  railway  only  went  to</span><span>  the  Northern  Territory  it  would  be  worth</span><span>  while  to  construct  it  ;  but  it  will  also com-</span><span>  municate,  as  I  have  before  pointed  out,  with</span><span>  Netherlands  India,  British  India,  the</span><span>  Malayan  Peninsula,  Siam,  China  ;  and  beyond</span><span>  that,  it  will  communicate  with  Europe  and</span></p> <p><span>  America.  Port  Darwin  is  the  focus  to  which</span></p> <p><span>  the  produce  of  these  countries  must  tend  ;</span><span>  then  this  line  will  not  stop  at  Port  Darwin  ;</span><span>  it  will  ramify  to  Queensland,  New  South</span><span>  Wales,  and  Victoria.  It  will  communicate</span><span>  with  Tasmania,  and  will  be  of  incalculable</span><span>  benefit  to  those  colonies,  and  who  can  calcu-</span><span>  late  what  will  be  the  result  from  tying</span><span>  together  all  these  countries  with  the  iron</span><span>  bonds  these  railways  will  produce  ?  You have</span><span>  now  begun  the  line  at  Port  Augusta  which,  as</span><span>  I  have  said,  will  go  to  Port  Darwin  ;  it  will</span><span>  strike  Queensland  at  its  south-west  corner.</span><span>  There  will  be  brought  along  it  the  produce</span><span>  from  the  south-western  part  of  Queensland,</span></p> <p><span>  the  Barcoo  country,  and  a  great  deal  of  pro-</span><span>  duce  of  the  fertile  country  of  the  west  part of</span><span>  New  South  Wales,  and  the  produce  of  South</span><span>  Australia  especially.  All  this  tends  to</span><span>  federation.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  There  need  not  be  any  formal  agree-</span><span>  ment  between  the  colonies,  perhaps,  in</span><span>  this  matter  of  the  transcontinental  line  ;</span></p> <p><span>  but  the  project  might  be  recognised  by</span></p> <p><span>  the  Governments  of  the  two  Eastern  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  colonies,  and  their  trunk  lines  so  carried</span></p> <p><span>  out  as  to  ultimately  intersect  the  great  &nbsp;</span><span>  South  Australian  railway.  Queensland,  at</span><span>  any  rate,  should  keep  it  in  view,  and,</span></p> <p><span>  while  providing  for  her  own  settlers</span><span>  quick  and  certain  communication  with</span><span>  the  coast,  should  also  become  a  compe-</span><span>  titor  for  the  trade  which  must  ultimately</span><span>  flow  through  Port  Darwin  or  some  other</span><span>  great  port  on  the  northern  coast.</span></p> <p><span>  In  matters  of  law,  federation  would</span></p> <p><span>  surely  not  be  impossible.  An  Australian</span><span>  Appeal  Court  has  been  often  suggested,</span><span>  instead  of  the  Privy  Council  ;  and there</span><span>  seems  no  valid  reason  why  the decisions</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  several  Supreme  Courts  of  the</span><span>  colonies  should  not  be  reviewed  by  a</span><span>  competent  Australian  tribunal.  Even</span><span>  Mr.  Berry  ought  to  acquiesce  in  such  a</span><span>  project,  if  only  as  one  calculated  to</span><span>  prepare  the  way  for  ultimate  separation</span><span>  from  the  mother  country.  Whether in</span><span>  the  matter  of  immigration  federal  action</span><span>  could  be  taken  or  not,  we  find  it  difficult</span><span>  to  determine.  Queensland  spends  far</span><span>  more  money  in  immigration  than  any  of</span><span>  the  other  colonies,  and  by  so  doing she</span><span>  supplies  them  with  ""  new  blood,""  but in</span><span>  return  she  draws  from  them  a  larger</span><span>  number  of  seasoned  colonists.  Still,</span><span>  there  is  no  doubt  that  were  there  one</span><span>  Australian  Emigration  Agency  in</span><span>  London  instead  of  three  or  four  a  better</span><span>  class  of  immigrant  might  be  procured,</span></p> <p><span>  and  at  a  less  cost  to  the  colonies  than</span></p> <p><span>  is  at  present  incurred.  In  matters  of</span><span>  defence,  too,  there  might  be  federal</span><span>  action  with  great  advantage  whenever  it</span><span>  is  deemed  necessary  to  have  a  navy  for</span><span>  the  protection  of  our  coasts.</span></p> <p><span>  The  most  immediate  benefit  would  be</span></p> <p><span>  realised,  however,  by  the  formation  of  a</span><span>  Customs  Union  ;  and  we  quite  agree</span><span>  with  the  Sydney  Chamber  of  Commerce</span><span>  that,  so  far  as  the  three  colonies  are  con-</span></p> <p><span>  cerned,  the  difficulties  are  not  in-</span><span>  superable.  The  prime  necessity  of  a  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  Customs  Union  is  a  common  tariff ;</span><span>  and  there  is  no  such  difference  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  between  the  tariffs  of  New  South</span></p> <p><span>  Wales,  South  Australia,  and  Queens-</span><span>  land,  as  to  Vender  a  common  tariff</span><span>  impracticable.  Such  tariff  would  neces-</span><span>  sarily  be  based  on  free  trade principles,</span><span>  and  the  Union  would  supply  a  guarantee</span><span>  against  capricious  tinkering.  A  common</span><span>  tariff  could  not  possibly  be  a very</span><span>  intricate  one.  To  Queensland  it  might</span><span>  entail  a  temporary  sacrifice  of revenue,</span><span>  but  that  would  be  partly compensated</span><span>  by  the  reduced  cost  of  the  Customs</span></p> <p><span>  department.  And  ultimately  there  would</span></p> <p><span>  be  no  loss  to  the  Treasury.  A  Customs</span></p> <p><span>  Union  would  knock  off  the  fetters  from</span></p> <p><span>  trade,  stimulate  mercantile  intercourse,</span><span>  and  encourage  the  producers  of  each</span><span>  colony  to  invest  in  those  industries  which</span></p> <p><span>  could  be  carried  0n  to  the  best  local  advan-</span><span>  tage.  All  this  would  stimulate  the</span><span>  general  progress  of  Australia,  and  make</span><span>  it  more  desirable  as  a  field  for  immigra-</span><span>  tion.  This  would  not  only  increase  the</span><span>  volume  of  immigration,  but  also  improve</span><span>  its  quality,  and  attract  money  capital  as  well</span><span>  as  bone  and  sinew.  The  advantages  to  be</span><span>  secured  by  a  Customs  Union  are  just</span><span>  those  which  Mr,  Douglas  and  our  sugar</span><span>  growers  hoped  to  obtain  through  that</span><span>  insidious  will-o'-the-wisp  known  as</span><span>  ""  Reciprocity.""  And  as  reciprocity  &nbsp;</span><span>  negotiations  have  failed,  there  is reason</span><span>  to  hope  that  the  way  is  clear  for  the  pro-</span><span>  posed  Customs  Union.  We  hope  the</span><span>  Sydney  Chamber  of  Commerce  will  take</span><span>  the  matter  up  vigorously,  and  that</span><span>  influence  may  be  brought  to  bear  &nbsp;</span><span>  upon  the  politicians  of  each  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  colonies  concerned.  We  should</span></p> <p><span>  think  the  more  enlightened  among</span><span>  them  would  hail  such  a movement</span><span>  as  a  set-off  to  the  grovelling  localism</span><span>  which  so  oppresses  the  administration of</span><span>  public  affairs  in  the  colonies.  A</span><span>  great  Australian  question  calculated  to</span><span>  absorb  the  attention  of  the  various legis-</span></p> <p><span>  latures,  would  be  an  immense  relief from</span></p> <p><span>  log-rolling  and  class  contention.</span></p> ",Article,1878-02-09,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin,</span><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  FEBRUARY  12,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  Saturday's  issue  the  hope  was  ex-</span><span>  pressed  that  Mr.  Pring  would  be  returned.</span><span>  The  opportunity  has  since  been  afforded</span><span>  us  of  perusing  the  speeches  of  both  candi-</span></p> <p><span>  dates,  and  our  opinion  that  Mr.  Pring  is</span><span>  the  more  fit  man  to  represent  the  metro-</span><span>  politan  city  is  decidedly  confirmed.</span></p> <p><span>  Much  of  the  space  allotted  to  Mr.</span><span>  Rutledge's  speech  is  occupied  in  defending</span><span>  his  retirement  from  the  Christian  ministry</span><span>  and  his  venture  into  the  arena  of  politics.</span><span>  With  this  the  general  public  of  the  colony</span><span>  have  nothing  whatever  to  do.  All  it  is</span><span>  necessary  for  us  to  admire  is  whether  the</span><span>  candidate,  by  ability,  experience,  and  grasp</span><span>  of  mind,  will  be  a  worthy  representative</span><span>  of  the  leading  constituency  in  the  colony.</span><span>  After  carefully  reading  Mr.  Rutledge's</span><span>  address,  we  say  advisedly  that  he  has</span><span>  made  a  mistake  in  wooing  the  electors  of</span><span>  Brisbane.  He  has  but  two  recom-</span><span>  mendations,  and  they  are  not  to  be</span><span>  despised.  He  is  a  man  of  unimpeachable</span><span>  character,  and  a  fluent  speaker.  But</span><span>  these  qualifications  will  not  make  up  for</span><span>  the  lack  of  others  equally  important  in</span><span>  which  the  candidate  is  confessedly  defi-</span><span>  cient.  On  the  land  question,  for</span><span>  example,  ""  he  had  not  arrived  at  a</span><span>  mature  conviction,  but  thought  a  land</span><span>  tax  might  be  imposed  so  as  not  to  press</span><span>  unjustly  in  any  case.""  Now,  even  Mr.</span><span>  Rutledge  should  have  known  that  a</span><span>  land  tax,  while  so  large  an  area  is</span><span>  held  under  conditional  lease  at  sixpence</span><span>  an  acre,  or  under  pastoral  lease  at  £2</span><span>  per  square  mile,  could  not  press  other-</span><span>  wise  than  unjustly.  He  also  wants</span><span>  cheap  railways,  like  those  Mr.  Angus</span><span>  Mackay  tells  us  of  in  America  ;  but</span><span>  those  best  acquainted  with  the  subject</span><span>  do  not  consider  that  Mr.  Mackay's</span><span>  cheap  railways  arc  really  economical,  as</span><span>  ""  construction  ""  goes  on  many  years  after</span><span>  the  lines  are  open  for  traffic  at  an  en-</span><span>  hanced  rate  of  cost.  Mr.  Rutledge  also</span><span>  objects  on  principle  to  Polynesian</span><span>  labour,  but  he  would  so  far  compound</span><span>  with  the  devil  as  to  legalise  its  intro-</span><span>  duction  for  sugar-growing,  because</span><span>  capital  has  been  embarked  in  that</span><span>  industry  on  the  faith  of  cheap  labour</span><span>  legislation.  But  he  would  not  allow  a</span><span>  Polynesian  to  be  employed  in  a  town,</span><span>  even  as  a  domestic  servant,  gardener,</span><span>  or  groom—that  would  be  touching  the</span><span>  unclean  thing.  He  approves  of  local</span><span>  Government,  and  disapproves  of  payment</span><span>  of  members,  but  is  not  prepared  to</span><span>  express  an  opinion  upon  the  tariff.  He</span><span>  thinks  the  Insolvency  Act  only  one</span><span>  remove  from  perfection  ;  because,</span><span>  apparently,  it  was  the  bantling  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  late  member  for  Brisbane,  under  whose</span><span>  ægis  Mr.  Rutledge  made  his  bow  to  the</span><span>  Brisbane  public.  On  the  important</span><span>  subjects  of  railway  expansion  and  finance</span><span>  the  candidate  was  silent,  and  his</span><span>  opinions  on  land  legislation  were  ""  not</span></p> <p><span>  matured.""</span></p> <p><span>  The  address  of  the  other  candidate</span><span>  was  in  marked  contrast  to  this.  Mr.</span><span>  Pring  shed  light  upon  every  subject</span><span>  he  touched,  and  he  gave  proof  of  inti-</span><span>  mate  acquaintance  with  the  real</span><span>  wants  of  the  colony.  A  considerable</span><span>  portion  of  his  speech  appears  in  another</span><span>  column,  and  we  need  only  ask  the</span><span>  intelligent  reader  to  give  an  impartial</span><span>  judgment  upon  it.  This  candidate's</span></p> <p><span>  remarks  on  the  railway  question,  for</span></p> <p><span>  example,  show  that  his  views  are  broad,</span></p> <p><span>  statesmanlike,  and  practical.  He  objects</span><span>  to  carrying  on  seven  non-paying  railways</span><span>  at  once,  but  advocates  pushing  the  main</span><span>  trunk  lines  into  the  far  western  interior,</span><span>  in  order  that  settlement  may  be  en-</span><span>  couraged,  and  trade  prevented  from</span><span>  drifting  to  the  southern  colonies.  It  will</span><span>  be  highly  gratifying  to  the  people  of  the</span><span>  central  districts  to  learn  that  a  Brisbane</span></p> <p><span>  audience  applauded  the  policy  of  trunk</span><span>  lines,  and  by  implication  condemned</span><span>  the  log-rolling  proceedings  which  have</span></p> <p><span>  committed  the  country  to  the  in-</span><span>  opportune  starting  of  lines  which  can-</span><span>  not  possibly  pay,  at  a  time  when  the</span><span>  whole  financial  strength  of  the  colony  is</span><span>  needed  to  complete  the  trunk  railways.</span><span>  In  this  speech  of  Mr.  Pring  we  discern</span><span>  the  first  gleam  of  hope  that  Brisbane</span><span>  and  Rockhampton  will  soon  be  found</span><span>  politically  united  to  resist  the  flood  of</span><span>  petty  localism  which  threatens  to  land</span><span>  the  colony  in  serious  difficulty  if  un-</span></p> <p><span>  checked.  It  was  because  the  late  mem-</span></p> <p><span>  ber  for  Brisbane  was  the  representative</span><span>  of  narrow-minded  localism  that  such</span><span>  union  was  not  consummated  long  ago.</span><span>  There  is  not  the  slightest  reason  for</span><span>  jealousy  between  Brisbane  and  Rock-</span><span>  hampton,  for,  as  Mr.  Pring  pointed  out,</span></p> <p><span>  the  greater  the  trade  which  passed</span><span>  through  Rockhampton  the  better  for  the</span><span>  colony,  and  the  better  for  Brisbane  as  the</span><span>  capital  of  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  Pressure  upon  0ur  time  and  space</span><span>  precludes  further  reference  to  Mr.</span><span>  Pring's  policy.  But  to  do  so  is  really  un-</span><span>  necessary,  for  his  published  speech  will</span><span>  answer  for  itself.  There  is  one  point,</span><span>  however,  on  which  a  remark  is  neces-</span><span>  sary.  Mr.  Pring  says  he  comes  forward</span><span>  ""  as  a  regenerated,  not  as  a  white-washed</span><span>  politician.""  This  is  obviously  an  allusion</span><span>  to  previous  ""  indiscretions,""  with  which</span><span>  the  Brisbane  people,  as  the  candidate  well</span><span>  knew,  must  be  intimately  acquainted.  We</span><span>  believe  they  accepted  it  as  a  genuine</span><span>  confession  of  previous  wrong-doing  ;</span><span>  and  we  prefer  that  mode  of  express-</span><span>  ing  ""  repentance  ""  to  the  plan  adopted</span><span>  by  those  reformed  persons  who  think  it</span><span>  expedient  to  make  a  public  confession</span><span>  on  a  teetotal  platform.  The  reports</span><span>  which  reach  us  lead  to  the  belief  that  for</span><span>  some  months  past  Mr  Pring  has  really</span><span>  mended  his  ways,  and  there  is  reason  to</span><span>  hope  that  he  will  henceforth  keep  them</span><span>  in  thorough  repair.  Those  who  have</span><span>  employed  him  professionally  admit  that</span><span>  he  is  trustworthy,  and  that  says  much  in</span><span>  his  favour.  The  presumption  is  that  a</span><span>  man  who  sticks  honestly  by  his  client</span><span>  will  stand  faithfully  by  his  country.  We</span><span>  say,  therefore,  by  all  means  let  him  have</span><span>  another  trial.  Had  he  joined  the  Good</span><span>  Templars  all  his  faults  would  have  been</span><span>  readily  condoned  ;  but  we  do  not  see</span><span>  why  ""  regeneration  ""  may  not  be</span><span>  thorough  without  the  aid  of  mystic</span><span>  ceremonies  and  cabalistic  initials.  We,</span><span>  at  any  rate,  prefer  to  judge  a  man's</span><span>  ""  regeneration  ""  by  the  evidences  fur-</span><span>  nished  by  his  life,  rather  than  by  his</span><span>  obtrusive  professions  of  public  penitence.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  following  telegram  has  been  kindly</span><span>  handed  to  us  by  His  Worship  the  Mayor  :—</span><span>  ""  Blackwater,  February  11,  1878.—W.

The  Pope's  death,  coming  almost  im-</span><span>  mediately  after  that  of  the  King  of  Italy,  is</span><span>  likely  to  introduce  further  complications</span><span>  into  the  problem  of  European  politics.</span></p> <p><span>  The  young  king  is  understood  to  be  far  more</span></p> <p><span>  hostile  to  the  Church  than  his  father  was,</span><span>  and  it  is  difficult  to  hasard  a  prediction  as  to</span><span>  the  consequences  of  these  almost  simultaneous</span><span>  changes  at  both  Vatican  and  Palace.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  have  received,  through  Messrs.  Gordon</span><span>  and  Gotch,  a  copy  of  the  fourth  edition  of  a</span><span>  work  on  ""  Billiards.""  The  book  is  hand-</span><span>  somely  bound,  the  typography  is  superior,</span><span>  and  the  diagrams,  of  which  there  are  no  less</span><span>  than  fifty-five,  are  etched  clearly  and  artisti-</span><span>  cally.  There  are  also  portraits  of  the</span><span>  celebrated  Roberts,  senior  and  junior,  and</span><span>  illustrations  of  interesting  scenes  at  the  table.</span><span>  The  contents  include  short  biographical</span><span>  notices  of  the  two  Roberts's,  ""  a  practical</span><span>  lesson,""  by  the  elder  Roberts,  explanation  of</span><span>  terms,  a  chapter  for  ladies,  rules  of  the  game,</span><span>  papers  on  pool,  pyramid,  American  and</span><span>  French  billiards,  and  most  painstaking</span><span>  instructions,  illustrated  by  the  diagrams,  of</span><span>  the  method  to  pursue  to  make  the  various</span><span>  strokes.  Taken  as  a  whole  the  book  is  a</span><span>  superior  exposition  of  the  intricacies  of</span><span>  billiards—a  game  which,  for  variety  of</span><span>  incident  and  scientific  combinations,  stands,</span><span>  in  our  opinion,  only  next  to  chess.  We  can</span><span>  recommend  this  book  to  all  who  wish  to  study</span><span>  the  game  of  billiards  for  the  harmless  pleasure</span></p> <p><span>  it  affords.</span></p> <p><span>  THOSE  who  enjoy  a  Turkish  Bath  will  be</span><span>  pleased  to  learn  that  the  premises  will  be</span><span>  re-opened  to-morrow.  There  are  now  very</span><span>  few  traces  of  the  fire.  In  re-building  the</span><span>  proprietor  has  made  extensive  alterations,  and</span><span>  when  completed,  they  will  be  beyond</span><span>  doubt,  the  most  suitable  of  the  kind  in  the</span><span>  colony.  The  visitor  will  be  particularly</span><span>  struck  with  the  large  and  airy  character  of  the</span><span>  various  rooms,  especially  the  undressing,  the</span><span>  hot-air,  the  shampooing,  and  the  cooling  rooms.</span><span>  The  cooling  room  thirty-two  feet  by  twenty,</span><span>  and  lofty  in  proportion  ;  being  situated  on  the</span><span>  bank  of  the  river,  it  catches  every  passing</span><span>  breeze,  ami  in  cverj  respect  is  suited</span><span>  for  its  purpose.  Extensive  improvements</span><span>  have  been  made  for  the  accommoda-</span><span>  tion  of  resident  invalids,  who  are,  by</span><span>  present  arrangements,  undisturbed  by  the</span><span>  ingress  or  egress  of  bathers.  A  plunge  bath,</span><span>  either  hot  or  cold,  has  be  been  built  of  brick  and</span><span>  lined  with  cement  ;  this  is  a  new  feature,  and</span><span>  will  enable  the  way-farer  to  get  a  bath  in  a</span><span>  few  minutes  and  proceed  on  his  business.</span><span>  The  proprietor  has  evidently  had  his  eye  on</span><span>  the  main  chance  by  providing  the  latest</span><span>  improvements,  and  has  not  spared  expense  in</span><span>  doing  so.

Mr.  Lord  and  Mr.</span><span>  Hickson  think  that  a  net  is  the  only  effective</span><span>  means  of  protection,  but  Mr.  Durietz  assures</span><span>  us  that  sulphuring  the  vines  is  a  preventive.</span><span>  Gympie  Times.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  MAN  WITH  THE  NEW  HAT.—At  Sir</span><span>  Bryan  O'Loghlen's  first  meeting,  the  Rolling</span><span>  Mills  being  found  too  small  for  the  large</span><span>  number  of  pesons  who  rolled  up,  an  adjourn-</span><span>  ment  was  made  to  the  open  air.

All  wc  can  say,</span><span>  then,  is  that  the  ^representatives  of  the</span><span>  people  must  be  on  the  alert,  and  allow</span><span>  no  clause  to  pass  kithout  rigid  examina-</span></p> <p><span>  tion.  Tlie  centra  and  northern  mem-</span></p> <p><span>  bers,  in  constdVring  this  question,</span></p> <p><span>  must  not  forget  that  the  present</span><span>  Ministry  is  exclus  vely  southern  in  its</span><span>  interests,  sympatl  ies,  and  instincts.</span><span>  There  is  not  one  central  or  northern</span></p> <p><span>  member  among  tl  :m  ;  nor  is  there  any</span><span>  such  member  in  he  position  to  offer</span><span>  them  advice  tvhic  they  are  likely  to</span><span>  accept.  We  have  t  3  hesitation  in  saying</span></p> <p><span>  that  the  hon.  men  ber  for  Blackall  has</span><span>  not  an  intelligent  ii  ea  on  this  important</span><span>  subject,  and  the  )nly  other  northern</span><span>  member  who  acts  '  'ith  the  Government</span><span>  Party  is  the  mei  iber  for  Cooktown,</span><span>  who,  as  a  thorough  going  southern  man,</span><span>  cannot  possibly  e:  amine  this  question</span><span>  from  a  northern  s  and-point.  Indeed,</span><span>  during  the  two  years  in  which</span><span>  Mr.  Murphy  has  sat  in  Parliament,</span><span>  he  has  never  betrat  ed  any  indications  of</span><span>  having  studied  poli  ical  questions  except</span><span>  in  their  regard  t&lt;  money  grants  and</span><span>  legal  technicality  Mr.  Beor,  the</span><span>  member  for  Bowe  1,  is  a  pure  theorist,</span><span>  and  is  moreover  oo  much  distrusted</span></p> <p><span>  by  Ministers  to  iL  consulted  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  I  subject.  I</span></p> <p><span>  If  we  look  at  Ihe  personnel  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Ministry,  and  of  Jthe  parly  who  have</span><span>  hitherto  kept  ihem'in  power,  we  cannot</span><span>  reasonably  expecJfrom  them  a  represen-</span><span>  tative  measure/  adapted  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  wants  of  thc  t  )untry.  Mr.  Douglas</span><span>  is  a  confessa  idealist-a  reveller</span><span>  in  philosophical  abstractions-a  poli-</span><span>  tician  who  looks  so  impartially  at  both</span><span>  sides  of  every  question  that  he  has</span><span>  no  settled  conv  :tions  on  any.  Mr.</span><span>  Griffith  is  simply  t  lawyer,  and  cares  not</span><span>  a  jot  for  politic  tl  principles  as  such.</span><span>  Numerous  profes  ional  engagements  and</span><span>  a  dry  legal  mind  combine  to  divert  his</span><span>  attention  and  syi  ipathics  from  political</span><span>  questions,  and  re  der  it  hopeless  to  ex-</span><span>  pect  from  him  an  higher  duty  than  the</span><span>  drafting  of  a  meas  ire  founded  upon  the</span><span>  ideas  of  his  collea  ues.  Mr.  Dickson  is</span></p> <p><span>  a  sensible  man,  I  ht  too  politically  im-</span><span>  mature  to  give  a  useful  opinion  on  so</span><span>  grave  a  subject  as  representation.</span><span>  Mr.  Miles  is  loo  fully  absorbed</span><span>  in  administrative!difficulties,  and  too</span><span>  rigid  as  well  as  too  narrow  in  his</span><span>  politicslopermillioj  :of  his  rendering  use-</span><span>  ful  legislative  servie  And  Mr.  Garrick,</span><span>  though  an  intellij  ent  and  thoughtful</span><span>  man,  seems  quite  u  table  to  get  beyond</span><span>  the  politics  of  the  obstructive  minority</span></p> <p><span>  in  the  deadlock  era  Mr.  Mein  is  not  a</span><span>  representative  of  I  e  people,  and  as  a</span><span>  politician  has  yet  tc  win  his  spurs.  And</span></p> <p><span>  when  added  to  tl  ;se  considerations  is</span><span>  the  circumstance  t  tat  Ministers  are  all</span><span>  identified  with  ll  ;  metropolitan  dis-</span><span>  tricts,  it  is  impossil  le  to  hope  that  their</span><span>  measure  will  be  ne  adapted  to  the</span><span>  wants  of  the  outl  ing  districts  of  the</span><span>  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  One  change  see  s  to  be  inevitable  if</span><span>  thc  Ministerial  sehe  ne  bc  accepted-the</span><span>  basis  of  gross  popul  lion  will  be  adopted</span><span>  instead  of  adult  njales.

During  the  year</span><span>  eight  extensions  wert  completed,  making</span><span>  a  total  of  423  miles  lof  line  and  7285^</span><span>  miles  of  wire,  whick  added  to  those</span><span>  previously  existing,  make  a  grand  total</span><span>  of  5033$  miles  of  liles  and  6778  miles</span><span>  of  wire  now  in  effective  operation.</span><span>  Kine  extensions  are  inlprogress,  so  that</span><span>  the  rate  of  extension  ii  being  well  main-</span><span>  tained.  There  are  J  at  present  136</span><span>  stations  in  daily  operation,  and  294</span><span>  officers  on  the  permanent  staff,  together</span><span>  with  40  officers  and  men  employed  on</span><span>  construction  and  maintenance  duty.</span><span>  Morse's  recording  instruments  are  still</span><span>  universally  employed  inlthis  colony,  out</span><span>  the  repeaters  for  Wheatstone's  instru-</span><span>  ments  having  arrived,  K  is  intended  to</span></p> <p><span>  re-commence  the  Automatic  system  be-  j</span><span>  tween  Brisbane  ana  Sydney,  so  soon  as  j</span><span>  arrangements  can  be  made  for  that  pur</span></p> <p><span>  pose.  !</span></p> <p><span>  The  revenue  and  expenditure  of  the  I</span><span>  department  are  as  follow  :-Cash</span><span>  receipts,  .£33,327  i  value  of  messages</span><span>  on  Government  service,  .£11,794;  and</span><span>  proportion  due  to  Queensland  on  inter-</span><span>  national  business,  ,£141;  total,,£45,262.</span><span>  The  disbursements  were-For  salaries,</span><span>  .£36,370  ;  continge  ides,  £14,831  ;  and</span><span>  refundments  to  ollie  r  colonies,  ¿2997  ;</span><span>  total,  ,£54,198.  The  expenditure  is,</span><span>  therefore,  in  execs  1  of  the  revenue  by</span><span>  ¿S936.</span></p> <p><span>  It  thus  appears  ll  at  the  department  ts</span><span>  a  heavy  charge  u  >on  the  colony,  as,</span><span>  besides  the  above  deficit,  there  is  the</span><span>  charge  fof  interest  on  the  cost  of  tele-</span><span>  graphic  constructioi  .  Of  this  ,¿34,440</span><span>  was  obtained  from  surplus  revenue,  but</span><span>  the  remainder  by  I  ians,  making  a  total</span><span>  cost  of  .£332,284  1  J  the  31st  December</span><span>  last,  which  legiti  nately  imposes  an</span><span>  interest  charge  011  the  department  of</span><span>  from  .£10,000  to  £17,000  per  annum,</span><span>  making  the  total  deficit  on  last  year's</span><span>  operations  about  ;  ""25,000.  But  there</span><span>  is  an  item  which  s  lould  fairly  be  placed</span><span>  lo  credit  in  redu  :tion  of  this  amount.</span><span>  The  shipping  inte  ligence  and  meteoro-</span><span>  logical  observatior  s  transmitted  by  wive</span></p> <p><span>  are  valued  at  cirrent  rates  at  about</span></p> <p><span>  ,£9000  per  annu  11.  Now  the  intelli-</span><span>  gence  thus  supplii  d,  provided  thc  work</span><span>  be  done  in  a  relia  ile  and  proper  way,  is</span><span>  well  worth  the  mc  ley  to  the  colony,  and</span><span>  it  is  work  that  &lt;  ould  not  be  effectively</span><span>  done  by  private  e  terprisc.  The  shipping</span><span>  intelligence  is  not  only  a  convenience  to</span><span>  shippers,  mercha  ts,  and  the  public  at</span><span>  large,  but  ten  ls  to  promote  the</span><span>  safety  of  shippii  g  and  the  lives  and</span><span>  property  involved  The  meteorological</span><span>  observations  cor  tribute  to  the  same</span><span>  results,  while  als  >  affording  records  re-</span><span>  garding  climatic  (  onditions,  which  are  of</span><span>  great  service  now  and  promise  to  be  still</span><span>  more  so  as  rehab  ;  data  are  accumulated</span><span>  extending  over  a  series  of  years.</span><span>  Estimating  this  £gooo,  therefore,  as  a</span><span>  fair  charge  on  th  :  current  revenue  of  the</span><span>  colony,  the  del  cit  is  reduced  to  the</span><span>  amount  of  intel  :st  on  the  cost  of  the</span><span>  telegraphs,  say  ¿17,000.</span></p> <p><span>  Even  in  this  view  of  the  matter,  the</span><span>  deficiency  is  1;  rge  for  the  resources  of</span><span>  the  colony;  bul  the  real  question  to  con-</span><span>  sider  is,  whethi  r  it  can  be  reduced  just</span><span>  now  without  an  indirect  loss  being</span><span>  thrown  upon  tl  e  colony,  which  would  be</span><span>  worse  than  the  present  charge.  Economy</span><span>  should  be  pn  ctised  to  the  utmost  ex-</span><span>  tent  consisten  with  the  public  good.</span><span>  In  other  wordsAhe  work  should  be  carried</span><span>  on  as  cheaply  ak  possible  for  the  value</span><span>  of  the  benefits  conferred.  We  can  afford</span></p> <p><span>  to  dispense  with  a  cash  balance,  pro</span><span>  I  vided  by  doing  ¡0  we  secure  a  substan-</span></p> <p><span>  tial  asset  of  far  {  eater  value.</span></p> <p><span>  But  this  v  :w  of  the  question</span><span>  seems  to  be  almost  entirely  over-</span><span>  looked  by  I  Er.  Cracknell,  who</span><span>  year  by  year  bewails  the  money</span><span>  loss  in  the  wcrkiog  of  his  depart</span><span>  '  ment,  and  suggei  ts  some  expedient  to</span></p> <p><span>  balance  the  inonie  and  expenditure.</span><span>  He  now  proposes  a  modification  of  the</span><span>  tariff  for  message  within  the  colony,  by</span><span>  which,  he  thinks,  the  revenue  would  be</span><span>  considerably  inert  ased,  whilst  the  amount</span><span>  of  traffic  would  b  t  but  very  slightly,  if  at</span><span>  all,  affected.  H  :  proposes  a  different</span><span>  method  of  charge  >,  and  a  division  of  the</span><span>  colony  into  two  sections,  the  dividing</span><span>  line  being  at  Bo'  en,  and  the  charges  foi</span><span>  messages  from  o\  ie  to  the  other  would  be</span><span>  double,  much  tl  e  same  as  is  now  thc</span><span>  case  between  thi  ¡  colony  and  New  South</span><span>  Wales.  The  prc  posed  alteration  in  the</span><span>  mode  of  charge  i  ¡  insidious,  as  it  might</span><span>  be  considered  at  first  sight  to  be  imma</span><span>  terial,  whilst  it  1  :ally  is  a  higher  tariff</span><span>  The  present  chat  ;e  is  is.  for  the  first  ter</span><span>  words,  and  id.  p  x  word  additional.  It</span><span>  is  proposed  to  re  ain  the  present  charge</span><span>  for  ten  words,  b  it  instead  of  charging</span><span>  id.  per  word  add  donal,  it  is  to  be  Cd</span><span>  for  every  five  or  i  -action  of  five  words</span><span>  so  that  a  messag&lt;  of  eleven  words  would</span><span>  cost  is.  6d.  inste;  A  of  is.  id.,  as  at  pre</span><span>  sent.

In  eithei</span><span>  way  of  putting  it,  he  charge  is  a  mosi</span><span>  legitimate  one,  and  n  a  very  high  degree</span><span>  reproductive.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  only  to  bi  expected  that  thii</span><span>  latest  recommenda  ion  of  Mr.  Crack</span></p> <p><span>  nell  will  receive  ron  5h  handling  from  oui</span><span>  northern  contcmpo  aries,  who  will  noi</span><span>  see  the  force  of  the  r  being  called  upor</span><span>  to  pay  in  this  fashion  for  their  connectior</span><span>  with  a  political  capital  fixed  in  one  cornel</span><span>  of  the  colony.  The  suggestion,  we  ar&lt;</span><span>  well  assured,  is  &lt;jne  that  the  mos></span></p> <p><span>  narrow-minded  southerner  would  shrinl</span><span>  from  after  a  little  TC  ection,  as  it  woulc</span><span>  not  only  be  unjust  s  id  prejudicial  to  th&lt;</span><span>  northern  section,  bu  :  also  the  southern</span><span>  almost  to  an  equal  :xtcnt.  The  tele</span><span>  graph  has  done  ram  h  to  overcome  th(</span><span>  difficulties  of  admin  itering  the  Govern</span><span>  ment  from  Brisbane  in  the  remote  ant</span><span>  outlying  districts  of  &lt;  ie  colony  in  a  satis</span><span>  factory  manner,  and  s  scarcely  less  use</span><span>  ful  in  facilitating  trac  ng  and  mercantil)</span><span>  transactions  between  one  portion  of  thi</span><span>  colony  and  another.  It  is,  therefore,  ¡</span><span>  matter  of  surprise  tha  a  Brisbane  news</span><span>  paper-the  evening  Telegraph-shoulc</span><span>  have  committed  the  b  under  of  express</span><span>  ing  its  approval  of  Mi.  Cracknell's  pro</span><span>  posed  territorial  separation,  lt  mus</span><span>  have  been  a  slip  of  ihâ  pen.  But  afte</span><span>  all,  it  is  scarcely  less  unreasonable  thai</span></p> <p><span>  the  puerile  displays  of  ^antipathy  to  tin</span></p> <p><span>  squatter,  which  that  journal  is  prone  ti</span><span>  indulge  in,  and  which  ls  found  in  iii</span><span>  leading  article  to  whicl\  we  now  refei</span></p> <p><span>  The  loss  on  the  Telegraph  Department  is</span><span>  there  attributed  tel  the  long  lines  of  wire</span><span>  which  have  been  ckrried  into  the  interior,</span><span>  for  the  benefit,  in  \sorae  instances,  of  a</span><span>  single  stationholdor  ;  and  our  contem-</span><span>  porary  thinks  that  \his  gentleman,  who-</span><span>  ever  he  may  be,  should  be  made  to  pay</span></p> <p><span>  heavily  for  the  convenience  brought  to</span></p> <p><span>  his  door,  and  not  rerfeive  it  at  thc  cost  of</span><span>  tlie  colony.  We  fall  to  see  the  direct</span><span>  bearing  of  this  assertion  on  the  question</span><span>  of  increased  charles  as  proposed</span><span>  by  Mr.  Cracknell  which  make</span></p> <p><span>  no  distinction  between  main  and</span></p> <p><span>  unimportant  lines,  imt  establish  an</span><span>  arbitrary  division  between  north  and</span><span>  south.  And  the  objection,  if  applied  to</span><span>  lines  into  the  intcribr,  is  altogether</span><span>  untenable.  Take,  for  Instance,  the  lines</span><span>  hence  to  the  Barcoo.  Can  it  be  said</span><span>  that  they  are  a  bad  in  'estment  for  the</span><span>  colony  ?  We  could  r  ame  one  station</span><span>  upon  which,  during  the  last  four  years,</span><span>  ¿¿""80,000  has  been  ex  lended  in  dams</span><span>  and  other  improvement  ;,  and  there  are</span><span>  many  other  stations  out  west  employing</span><span>  large  numbers  of  men,  That  country</span><span>  is,  at  present,  in  sole  oe  :upation  of  thc</span><span>  squatter,  but  it  returns  a  very  large</span><span>  revenue  to  the  Treasury,  and  thc  amount</span><span>  of  telegraphic  business/with  Blackall,  the</span><span>  farthest  station  westwAd,  is  really  very</span><span>  large.  I</span></p> <p><span>  It  is,  perhaps,  useless  further  to  discuss</span><span>  the  proposal  of  Mr.  Cracknell,  as  there</span><span>  is  no  chance  of  its  seriously  exciting</span><span>  public  attention  except  in  its  condem</span></p> <p><span>  n^tion;  ^  2~~7</span></p> <p><span>  THE  nominatiofi  for  the  vacancy  in  Archer</span><span>  Ward  drew  a/more  thai  usual  number  of</span><span>  citizens  jassWday  to  thc  lt  unicipal  Chamber.</span><span>  Slaking  due  allowance  fi  r  thc  freedom  of</span><span>  speech  permitted  on  st  cb  occasions,  thc</span><span>  meeting  was  creditable  to  j  ll  concerned.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.  j</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  AUGUST  22,  187S.</span></p> <p><span>  TUF.  Berlin  Congress  of  1878  is  justly</span><span>  entitled  to  rank  amongst  the  most  in-</span><span>  fluential  of  diplomatic  gatherings,  both</span><span>  on  account  of  the  distinguished  statesmen</span><span>  who  took  part  in  it,  and  the  importance</span><span>  of  its  decisions.  The  character  of  this</span><span>  congress  and  the  circumstances  tinder</span><span>  which  it  was  held,  are  deserving  of</span><span>  recognition,  inasmuch  as  they  contributed</span><span>  very  materially  to  the  satisfactory  results</span></p> <p><span>  of  its  deliberations.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  Congress  ""  .ind  ""  conference  ""  are</span><span>  often  used  as  interchangeable  terms,  but</span><span>  this  is  not  quite  correct.  Congress,  in</span><span>  diplomacy,  is  a  term  applied  to  ""an</span><span>  assemblage  of  sovereigns  or  ambassadors</span><span>  of  the  highest  rank,  convoked  for  the</span><span>  purpose  of  concluding  a  general  peace,</span><span>  or  of  treating  the  general  political  in-</span><span>  terests  of  Europe.  In  this  latter  sense</span><span>  a  modem  congress  may  be  regarded  as  a</span><span>  representative  council  of  states  or  nations</span><span>  by  which  differences  may  be  adjusted,</span></p> <p><span>  and  the  niles  of  international  law</span><span>  determined  and  enforced.  The  term</span></p> <p><span>  congress,  however,  is  only  strictly</span><span>  applicable  to  meetings  of  this  nature</span><span>  on  the  most  important  occasions,</span><span>  and  when  all  the  powers  are  represented.</span><span>  Thc  term  conference  is  used  to  describe</span></p> <p><span>  diplomatic  meetings  of  ministers  of  the</span><span>  first  or  second  rank,  called  together  for  a</span><span>  special  purpose,  either  to  modify  existing</span><span>  treaties  by  consent,  or  to  suggest  means</span><span>  of  dealing  with  a  critical  stale  of  affairs.""</span><span>  Tile  difference  is  rather  one  of  degree</span><span>  than  of  character,  but  it  is  none  the  less</span><span>  marked.  Conferences  have  been  very</span><span>  numerous  of  late  years,  but  congresses</span><span>  have  been  of  rate  occurrence,  not  more</span><span>  than  about  half  a  dozen  having  taken</span><span>  place  in  Europe  in  the  course  of  the  last</span><span>  200  years.  One  of  the  earliest  and  most</span></p> <p><span>  remarkable  in  modem  times  was  the</span><span>  Congress  ol  Westphalia,  in  1648,  after</span><span>  the  Thirty.,Years'  War.  Never  before,</span><span>  it  is  recorded,  had  so  august  an  assembly</span><span>  met  in  Europe  for  the  termination  of  a</span><span>  sanguinary  war,  for  the  establishment  of</span><span>  peace  between  two  hostile  creeds,  and</span><span>  for  the  regulation  of  territorial  questions</span><span>  by  common  agreement.  At  that  Congress</span><span>  were  laid  the  foundations  of  modern</span></p> <p><span>  Europe,  and  its  leading  principles</span><span>  subsisted  down  into  the  present  century.</span><span>  Another  congress  of  special  note  was</span><span>  that  of  Vienna  in  1814,  at  which  roo</span><span>  sovereigns  and  ministers  were  assembled.</span><span>  That  congress  was  so  large  that  general</span><span>  deliberation  was  not  even  attempted  ;</span><span>  the  representatives  never  met  in  Council,</span><span>  and  the  business  was  entirely  transacted</span><span>  by  committees  of  the  five  great</span><span>  Powers.  This  Congress  concluded  its</span><span>  '  bluings  In  the  following  year,  the  famous</span></p> <p><span>  Treaty  of  1815  having  being  signed</span><span>  eleven  days  before  the  battle  of  Water</span><span>  loo,""by  the  Plenipotentiaries  of  the  eight</span><span>  Powers  then  assembled-at  Vienna;  and</span><span>  that  treaty  secured  a  peace  of  forty  years'</span><span>  duration,  and  laid  the  foundation  of  a</span><span>  system  of  public  law  which  was  long  held</span><span>  sacred,  as  the  common  basis  of  the</span><span>  rights  of  every  member  of  the  European</span><span>  family.  The  next  congress  was  held  at</span><span>  Paris  in  1856,  and  the  arrangements</span><span>  then  agreed  upon  having  been  disturbed</span><span>  by  Russia  on  the  conclusion  of  the  late</span><span>  campaign  against  Turkey,  the  necessity</span><span>  arose  for  the  congress  which  only  a  few</span><span>  weeks  ago  concluded  its  sittings</span><span>  at  Berlin.  At  this  congress  were</span><span>  present  all  the  most  distinguished</span><span>  statesmen  of  Europe,  who  were  attended</span><span>  by  a  large  and  able  staff  of  councillors</span><span>  and  secretaries,  in  all  about  fifty  trained</span><span>  officials.  Thegathering  hasbeen  truthfully</span><span>  described  as  a  Parliament  of  the  European</span></p> <p><span>  nations.</span></p> <p><span>  When  this  congress  was  decided  upon</span><span>  and  its  basis  of  deliberation  made  to</span><span>  cover  the  whole  of  the  provisions  of  the</span><span>  San  Stefano  Treaty,  great  hopes  were  in-</span><span>  dulged  that  it  would  have  a  satisfactory</span><span>  issue.  But  these  hopes  mainly  rested</span><span>  on  the  fact  that  Russia  in  consenting  to</span><span>  the  submission  of  the  treaty  of  San</span><span>  Stefano  in  its  entirely  for  discussion,  had</span><span>  made  concessions  which  cleared  the  way</span><span>  for  a  peaceful  settlement.  There  were,</span><span>  however,  not  wanting  in  England  serious</span><span>  misgivings  of  failure,  and  these  arose</span><span>  chiefly  from  thc  fact  that  the  pleni-</span><span>  potentiaries  of  Great  Britain  were</span><span>  to  be  the  Premier  and  Minister</span></p> <p><span>  for  Foreign  Affairs.  The  inquiry</span><span>  was  raised,  what  would  become</span><span>  of  the  Government  whilst  the  two  most</span><span>  important  members  were  absent.  What</span></p> <p><span>  control  could  the  Ministers  in  London</span><span>  exercise  over  their  distinguished</span><span>  Plenipotentiaries.  It  was  even  alleged</span><span>  that  such  control  was  out  of  the  ques-</span><span>  tion,  and  that  Lord  Beaconsfield  and  the</span><span>  Marquis  of  Salisbury  were  for  all</span><span>  practical  purposes  the  Government,  in-</span><span>  dependent  of  other  Ministers,  and  even</span><span>  of  the  Parliament.  It  was  also  pointed</span><span>  out  that  responsible  Ministers  would  be</span><span>  at  a  disadvantage  in  the  Congress,  in  the</span><span>  event  of  a  disagreement  upon  material</span><span>  points,  as  the  course  they  might  feel</span><span>  called  upon  to  take  would  be  binding,</span><span>  whereas  in  the  case  of  delegates  the</span><span>  Government  could  refuse  to  ratify  their</span><span>  action  without  being  itself  com-</span><span>  promised.  To  these  and  similar  ob-</span><span>  jections,  however,  Sir  Stafford  North-</span><span>  cote  stated  in  Parliament  that  the  whole</span><span>  of  the  proceedings  and  the  whole  of</span><span>  the  policy  which  was  involved</span><span>  in  the  meeting  of  the  Congress,  had  been</span><span>  the  subject  of  lon;;  and  most  anxious</span><span>  deliberation  on  the  part  of  Her  Majesty's</span><span>  Government  ;  thu  they  had  in  the  fullest</span><span>  manner  disciis?ed  rmonjj  themselves  Ml</span><span>  the  questions  whirli  were  likely  to  arise,</span><span>  and  thal  there  was  so  complete  an  under-</span><span>  standing  of  those  questions  that  they  did</span><span>  not  anticipate  those  disadvantages  So</span><span>  which  Ihe  leader  of  the  Opposition  had</span></p> <p><span>  referred.</span></p> <p><span>  ll  has  since  trausi!Ír  ,d  how  complete</span></p> <p><span>  was  the  understandint;  arrived  at  foy  the</span><span>  British  Cabinet  as  lo  lin:  policy  to  be</span><span>  pursued  at  the  Congress.  A  preliminary</span><span>  treaty  had  been  agreed  lo  and  signed  by</span><span>  Salisbury  and  SrhouvaluflT,  specifying</span><span>  what  conditions  of  the  San  Stefano  treaty</span><span>  would  not  be  objected  to  by  Great</span><span>  Britain,  what  modifications  Russia  con-</span><span>  ceded,  and  upon  what  points  the  British</span><span>  plenipotentiaries  would  be  al  liberty  to</span></p> <p><span>  act  at  their  own  discretion.  The  ne-</span></p> <p><span>  gotiation  of  this  preliminary  treaty</span></p> <p><span>  must  have  been  carried  on  under  the</span><span>  sanction  of  the  British  Cabinet  ;  and  the</span><span>  existence  ol  a  supplementary  memoran-</span><span>  dum,  of  a  fortnight's  later  date,  and</span><span>  consisting  entirely  of  stipulations  and</span><span>  reservations  in  favour  of  Great  Britain,</span><span>  affords  evidence  of  the  great  care  and</span><span>  deliberation  bestowed  upon  thc  whole</span><span>  question.  And  :t  still  remained,  after</span><span>  those  documents  bad  been  signed,  to</span><span>  revise  their  terms  and  conditions,  and  to</span><span>  come  to  a  complete  understanding  as  to</span><span>  the  course  to  be  adopted  at  the  Con-</span><span>  gress  lo  minimise  the  concessions</span><span>  to  Russia.  It  was  asserted  by  the</span><span>  London  correspondent  of  thc  S.  M.</span><span>  Herald,  in  his  letter  lo  that  journal  by</span><span>  Inst  mail,  that  a  minority  of  the  British</span><span>  Cabinet  including  the  Premier,  was  op-</span><span>  posed  to  any  separate  dealings  with</span><span>  Russia,  and  that  the  Anglo-Russian</span><span>  treaty  having  been  negociated  without</span><span>  his  approval,  and  on  terms  loo  favour-</span><span>  able  to  Russia,  was  the  reason  why  he</span><span>  himself  attended  the  Congress.  But,</span><span>  whilst  admitting  the  probability  that</span><span>  sharp  contention  existed  in  the  Cabinet,</span><span>  and  that  a  majority  of  the  ministers</span><span>  favoured  the  separate  négociations,</span><span>  anil  weie  inclined  to  concede  more  than</span><span>  the  Premier  thought  advisable,  we  incline</span><span>  to  thc  opinion  that  no  difference  existed</span><span>  as  to  the  form  the  Congress  should  take,</span><span>  and  that  Lord  Beaconsfield  attended  it</span><span>  in  order  lhat  the  acts  of  the  pleni-</span><span>  potentiaries  of  Great  Britain  should  be</span><span>  thc  acts  of  men  carrying  with  them  the</span><span>  full  weight  and  responsibility  of  the</span><span>  Government  and  country.  An  attempt</span><span>  was  to  be  made  to  determine  without</span><span>  a  direct  appeal  to  arms  what</span><span>  should  be  the  relative  positions</span><span>  of  the  Great  Powers  in  the  Jiast,  and</span><span>  how  their  influence  should  be  exerted  on</span><span>  behalf  of  the  smaller  nationalities.  Such</span><span>  issues  demanded  the  ablest  and  most</span></p> <p><span>  authoritative  statesmanship,  and  England</span><span>  would  have  been  placed  at  a  manifest</span><span>  disadvantage  if  represented  by  persons</span><span>  of  less  weight  and  authority  than  the</span><span>  Chancellors  and  Foreign  Ministers  of</span><span>  other  countries.  The  success  of  the</span><span>  Congress  will  bring  this  mode  of  deter-</span><span>  mining  international  disputes  into  in-</span><span>  creasing  favour,  and  will  therefore  mate-</span><span>  rially  promote  the  interests  of  peace.</span></p> <p><span>  Olin.

It  is</span><span>  evident  that  thc  postponement  of  thc  elections</span><span>  until  the  rolls  for  1879  should  he  available,  as</span><span>  desired  hy  the  Government,  was  found  on</span><span>  full  consideration  to  bc  inexpedient.

On  thc  motion  of  Mr.  Livermore,</span><span>  seconded  by  Mrs.  Milford,  and  carried,  the</span><span>  meeting  was  adjourned  till  Wednesday,  thc</span><span>  25th  September.</span></p> <p><span>  Mu.  IiAKRMSY  yesterday  evening  made</span><span>  further  experiments  with  thc  telephone  of  a</span><span>  very  interesting  character.  Tho  communica-</span><span>  tion  was  from  Mr.  Langley's  drawing-room  to</span><span>  thc  Oddfellows'  Hall,  by  means  of  ono</span><span>  ordinary  telegraph  wire,  to  which  tho  tele-</span><span>  phones  were  attached.  About  eight  o'clock,</span><span>  when  all  was  in  readiness,  Mr.  Langley  put</span><span>  tho  telephone  to  his  car,  and  heard  distinctly</span><span>  the  voices,  asking,  ""  How  do  you  bear  that  ?""</span><span>  uttering  tho  ""Coo-ee,""  aud  singing  verses</span><span>  of  well-known  songs.  Tho  telephone</span><span>  was  passed  round  to  two  or  three</span><span>  gentlemen  in  the  room,  who  heard  similar</span><span>  sounds  as  distinctly  as  if  they  were  made  only</span><span>  down-stairs.  On  ono  occasion,  when  we</span><span>  applied  the  telephone  to  our  ear,  tiicre  was  a</span><span>  confused  mixturo  of  singing,  speaking,  aud</span><span>  instrumental  music.  These,  it  turned  out,  4</span><span>  were  the  soumis  caught  by  the  instru-</span><span>  ment  from  a  religious  service  on</span><span>  the  street  opposite  the  Telegraph  Office.</span><span>  These  and  similar  interruptions,  very</span><span>  much  interfered  with  the  effectiveness  of  the</span><span>  experiments.  Thc  voices  came  with  a  dull,</span><span>  full,  and  articulate  sound  ;  but  the  music  of</span><span>  thc  piano  was  as  distinct  to  tho  car,  and  as</span><span>  enjoyable,  as  if  sitting  beside  thc  pianist.</span><span>  Mr.  Langley  is  pursuing  his  telephonic  experi-</span><span>  ments  with  great  steal  and  pleasure,  and  we</span><span>  believe  his  telephones  arc  os  effective  os  any</span><span>  others  in  Queensland.</span></p> <p><span>  Ii.us'Kss  OF  Sin  OEOURK  GREV.-  From  Kew</span><span>  Zealand  papers  we  leam  that  ""Sir  George</span><span>  Grey  has  boen  very  ill,  and  is  so  still.

A  correspondent,  who  lias  no</span><span>  ambition  to  appear  in  print,  sends  us  the  fol-</span><span>  lowing  statement  of  tile  way  in  which  the</span><span>  work  appears  to  have  been  mismanaged,  and</span><span>  authorises  us  to  inako  usc  of  his  name,  if  ne-</span><span>  cessary.

It</span><span>  was  actually  commenced  about  four  years  ago,</span><span>  but  after  a  while  stopped  ;  again  work  was</span><span>  resumed,  over  twelve  months  ago,  and  the</span><span>  road  cleared  from  Blackall  to  Aumilllcr's  Gap  ;</span><span>  the  work  was  finished  up  to  that  place  in</span><span>  April  last.  Since  May  a  road  party  has  been</span><span>  at  work  at  Aiuniiller's  Gap,  constructing  a</span><span>  bridge  over  a  dry  watercourse,  to  connect  two</span><span>  spurs  of  thc  range,  thc  distance  being  about</span><span>  eighty  feet,  but  when  it  will  he  finished  no-</span><span>  body  cou  tell.  The  whole  joh  could  have  been</span><span>  easily  completed  in  say  two  or  three</span><span>  months.  Timber  is  within  half-a-inile  to  four</span><span>  miles,  the  season  has  boen  all  that  man  could</span><span>  desire,  and  a  competent  overseer  is  in  charge  ;</span><span>  but  for  all  that  no  progress  has  been  made,</span><span>  and  simply  because  there  is  mismanagement  in</span><span>  other  quarters.  For  instance,  at  times  when</span><span>  a  set  of  men  were  engaged,  no  rations  were</span><span>  sent  up  ;  when  rations  would  come,  the  men</span><span>  had  been  discharged.  That  has  happened</span><span>  several  times.  Likewise  a  blacksmith  was</span><span>  sent  up,  but  no  iron  -,  and  when  the  iroD</span><span>  arrived,  tools  wore  not  forthcoming.  A  vice</span><span>  had  actually  to  be  brought  from  Clermont.</span><span>  Who  is  to  blame,  and  who  lias  to  pay  the</span><span>  piper?  Thc  road  when  completed  will  save</span><span>  thc  Blackall  people  from  eighty  to  ninety  miles</span><span>  of  carriage  ou  goods.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  OCTOBER  28,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court,  on  Saturday,  before</span><span>  the  Police  Magistrate,  Gertrude  and  Mary</span><span>  Gough  were  again  brought  up  on  remand  and</span><span>  further  remanded  until  this  morning.  We</span><span>  understand  that  the  youngest  child,  Mary,</span><span>  has  since  been  taken  care  of  by  a  person  who</span><span>  is  willing  to  adopt  her.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  WE  are  informed  that  Mr.  R.  K.  Jefferies</span></p> <p><span>  brought  six  ounces  of  gold  town  on  Saturday,</span><span>  the  result  of  a  trial  crushing  of  six  tons  of</span><span>  stone  from  the  Weston  Patrick  Reef,  situated</span><span>  at  Three-mile  Creek,  near  Crocodile.  From</span><span>  what  we  can  learn,  the  stone  was  obtained</span><span>  from  the  60-foot  level,  where  the  reef  has</span><span>  attained  a  width  of  two  feet,  and  is  easily</span><span>  worked.  The  shaft  is  eighty  feet  in  depth,</span><span>  and  was  sunk  some  nine  or  ten  years  since,</span><span>  but  was  afterwards  abandoned.  It  is  stated</span><span>  that  the  proprietors  are  so  satisfied  with  their</span><span>  prospects  that  they  intend  to  try  a  crushing</span><span>  from  the  80-foot  level,  and  should  the  stone</span><span>  prove  anything  like  the  parcel  tried  last</span></p> <p><span>  week,  the  property  may  be  deemed  a  valuable  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  one.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  From  the  Maryborough  Chronicle  we learn</span><span>  that  the  Circuit  Court  sittings  in  its  criminal</span><span>  jurisdiction  were  commenced  on  Friday,  the</span><span>  18th  instant,  before  his  Honor  Mr.  Justice</span><span>  Lutwyche,  Acting  Chief  Justice,  the  Hon.  R.</span><span>  Pring,  instructed  by  Mr.  Keane,  from  the</span><span>  Attorney  General's  office,  prosecuting  on  be-</span><span>  half  of  the  Crown.  The  following  cases  were</span><span>  disposed  of:-Henry  Francis  Burchett  for</span><span>  writing  a  threatening  letter  to  Mr.  Broadbent,</span><span>  station  holder,  Gympie,  received  a  sentence  of</span><span>  six  months  ;  Mickey,  an  aboriginal,  charged</span><span>  with  murdering  an  aboriginal  woman,  was</span><span>  acquitted,  and  Brandy,  charged  with  murder-</span><span>  ing  Miss  Sinclair,  at  Knockbreak,  Gayndah,</span><span>  was  found  guilty  of  manslaughter  and  sen-</span><span>  tenced  to  five  years'  imprisonment.  No  bills</span><span>  were  filed  in  the  cases  of  Uloff  Peterson,  man-</span></p> <p><span>  slaughter  of  a  Polynesian  ;  John  Collins,</span><span>  arson  ;  Albert  Charles  Bemister,  forgery  ;</span><span>  and  Theodore  Kuhn,  stealing  a  horse,  saddle</span><span>  and  bridle.  The  case  against  Mr.  Black,</span><span>  late  Town  Clerk  of  Gayndah,  fell  through,</span><span>  owing  to  the  Rate-Collector  of  Gayndah  failing</span><span>  to  bring  with  him  certain  documents  necessary</span><span>  for  carrying  on  the  trial.  There  was  only  one</span><span>  civil  cause  for  trial  on  the  following  Tuesday</span><span>  -that  of  Johnson  v.  Priddy  and  others-for</span><span>  improper  distraint,  damages  to  the  extent  of</span><span>  £500  being  claimed.  The  jury  gave  a  verdict</span><span>  with  costs  for  the  defendants,  for  whom  Mr.</span><span>  Pope  A.  Cooper  appeared.  Mr.  Pring</span><span>  appeared  for  the  plaintiff.</span></p> <p><span>  A  MEETING  of  persons  qualified  to  vote  for</span><span>  Directors  under  the  provisions  of  the  Mar-</span><span>  supials  Destruction  Act  was  held  in  the  Court</span><span>  House  on  Saturday,  at  noon.  There  was  a</span><span>  good  attendance,  the  following  gentlemen</span><span>  being  present  ..-Messrs.  W.  Pattison,  P.  F.</span><span>  Macdonald,  Duncan,  W.  Orr,  M'Kenzie,</span><span>  Hudson,  Smith,  J.  Orr,  James  Wood,  Palfrey,</span><span>  H.  Milman,  Geddes,  Cross,  and  Lamond.</span><span>  Mr.  W.  Pattison  was  called  to  the  chair,  and</span><span>  stated  the  object  of  the  meeting,  which  was  to</span><span>  fill  up  the  vacancy  in  the  Board  of  Directors,</span><span>  caused  by  the  resignation  of  Mr.  T.  Vicary.</span><span>  Mr.  Geddes  moved,  and  Mr.  Robert  Duncan</span><span>  seconded,  that  Mr.  H.  Milman  be  elected  in</span><span>  the  room  of  Mr.  Vicary.  The  motion  was</span><span>  carried  unanimously.  The  meeting  then</span><span>  dispersed,  and  a  meeting  of  the  Directors  was</span><span>  afterwards  held,  the  following  gentlemen  being</span><span>  present  :-Messrs.  P.  Macdonald,  W.</span><span>  Pattison,  Orr,  Duncan,  and  Milman.  On  the</span><span>  motion  of  Mr.  Macdonald,  seconded  by  Mr.</span><span>  Milman,  and  carried  unanimously,  Mr.  W.</span><span>  Pattison  was  elected  Chairman.  Mr.  Stanley</span><span>  G.  Hill  was  elected  Secretary  on  the  motion</span><span>  of  Mr.  Macdonald,  seconded  by  Mr.  Duncan.</span><span>  The  Chairman  said  their  next  business  was  to</span><span>  fix  the  tax  imposed  for  carrying  out  the  pro-</span><span>  visions  of  the  Act,  and  he  thought  that  it</span><span>  should  be  moderate.  Although  there  had</span><span>  been  some  dissatisfaction  in  the  district  with</span><span>  regard  to  the  tax,  he  thought  that  at  present</span><span>  there  was  a  general  feeling  that  it  was</span><span>  necessary.  He  thought  a  rate  of  £1  per  100</span><span>  cattle  for  twelve  months  would  be  agreed  to</span><span>  by  most  owners.  Mr.  Milman  moved,  and</span><span>  Mr.  Orr  seconded,  that  the  rate  be</span><span>  fixed  at  20s.  per  100  head  of  cattle  and</span><span>  2s.  per  100  head  of  sheep.  The  motion</span><span>  was  carried.  On  the  motion  of  Mr.  Mac-</span><span>  donald,  seconded  by  Mr.  Orr,  7d.  per  scalp</span><span>  was  fixed  to  be  paid  for  kangaroos,  and  the</span><span>  highest  price  permitted  by  the  Act  (3d.  per</span><span>  head)  for  scalps  of  wallabies  and  paddymelons.</span><span>  After  some  conversation  the  following  were</span><span>  appointed  as  receivers  of  scalps,  subject  to</span><span>  their  willingness  to  act  when  requested  to  do</span><span>  so  by  the  Secretary  :-Mr.  Geddes  and</span><span>  Sergeant  Hegarty  (Yaamba);  Mr.  Jardine  and</span><span>  Sergeant  Martin  (Marlborough)  .  Messrs.</span><span>  John  Costello  and  Corten  (Cawarral)  ;  Mr.  F,</span><span>  Hobler  and  Sergeant  Doyle  (Westwood);  the  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  Chairman  of  Directors  (Mr.  W.  Pattison)  and</span><span>  Clerk  of  Petty  Sessions  (Rockhampton).  The</span><span>  meeting  then  adjourned.</span></p> <p><span>  AN  advertisement  announces  that  Mr.  John</span><span>  Macfarlane  will,  on  Wednesday  evening  next,</span><span>  address  the  doctors  of  Rockhampton  in  the</span><span>  School  of  Arts.  As  member  for  the  town</span></p> <p><span>  during  the  last  Parliamentary  session,  and  as</span><span>  a  candidate  for  re-election,  he  will  be  ex-</span><span>  pected  to  review  the  legislation  in  which</span><span>  he  took  part,  and  to  state  his</span><span>  opinions  on  the  leading  questions  of  the  day.</span><span>  His  intelligent  and  assiduous  attention  to  his</span><span>  public  duties,  whether  those  immediately</span><span>  affecting  his  constituents  or  of  a  more  general</span><span>  character,  cannot  be  questioned,  and  we  have</span><span>  no  doubt  that  the  electors  will  appreciate</span><span>  rightly  the  valuable  service  he  has  rendered</span><span>  in  the  past,  and  is  capable  of  rendering  in  the</span><span>  future.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  The  Bishop  of  Brisbane  preached  twice  yes-</span><span>  terday  in  St.  Paul's  Church,  and  also  ad-</span></p> <p><span>  dressed  the  candidates  for  confirmation  in  the</span><span>  afternoon.  On  all  three  occasions  the  atten-  &nbsp;</span><span>  dance  was  large.  In  the  morning  Dr.  Hale</span><span>  made  special  reference  to  the  rite  of  confirma-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  tion,  pointing  out  the  duty  of  parents  to  teach</span><span>  their  children  in  religions  matters,  and  con-</span><span>  cluded  by  exhorting  them  to  take  advantage</span><span>  of  Sunday-school  instruction.  In  the  after-</span><span>  noon  he  addressed  the  candidates,  numbering</span><span>  twenty-five,  seventeen  of  whom  were  females,</span><span>  who  were  then,  in  the  usual  manner,  confirmed</span><span>  in  the  Christian  faith.  In  the  evening  Dr.</span><span>  Hale  preached  from  Luke  xix.  13,  last  clause</span><span>  of  the  verse  -  ""Occupy  till  I  come."" He pre-</span><span>  faced  his  remarks  by  stating  that  we  are  all</span><span>  stewards,  having  nothing  of  our  own,  but  using</span><span>  the  property  of  another,  to  whom  we  should</span><span>  have  to  give  an  account  when  He  came.</span><span>  The  words  showed  the  certainty  of  His</span><span>  coming,  suggested  by  the  word  till,  when</span><span>  our  stewardship  would  be  ended  and  the</span><span>  account  must  be  rendered.  All  men  were</span><span>  placed  under  the  obligation  of  diligence  in</span><span>  this  particular,  but  Christians  especially,</span><span>  whose  property  not  only  belonged  to  their</span><span>  Master,  but  who  themselves  belonged  to  Him,</span><span>  having  been  purchased  by  His  blood.  He</span><span>  concluded  by  an  exortation  to  faithfulness,</span><span>  being  encouraged  thereto  by  the  praise  of  their</span><span>  Master,  as  well  as  deterred  from  an  opposite</span><span>  line  of  conduct  by  the  punishment  which</span><span>  awaited  the  unjust  stewards:  ""these,  mine</span><span>  enemies,  bring  them  hither  and  slay  them.""</span><span>  The  sermon  was  listened  to  with  great</span></p> <p><span>  attention.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  GROUNDING  OF  THE  IMMIGRANT  SHIP</span><span>  CAROLINE.-When  the  Caroline  arrived  in</span><span>  Wide  Bay,  (says  the  M.  Chronicle,)  she struck</span><span>  ground  after  anchoring,  but  by  cutting  the</span><span>  anchor  and  five  fathoms  of  chain,  safely  got</span><span>  away.  An  official  enquiry  into  the  circum-</span><span>  stances  of  the  case  has  been  called  by  the</span><span>  Shipping  Inspector.  Years  ago  our  Harbour</span><span>  Master  urgently  recommended  the  establish-</span><span>  ment  of  a  light  vessel  at  the  Fairway Bouy</span><span>  as  the  most  efficient,  and  in  the  long  run,</span><span>  economical  method  of  carrying  on  the  pilot</span><span>  service  in  Hervey's  Bay.  A  telegraph  line  to</span><span>  Sandy  Cape,  and  the  appointment  of  a  steamer</span><span>  for  harbour,  pilot,  and  towing  pnrposes,  was</span><span>  also  earnestly  advised,  and  it  was  understood</span><span>  that  the  Lucy,  now  working  with  the  dredge,</span><span>  would  be  appointed  to  the  service.  But</span><span>  nothing  came  of  it.  Pending  the  enquiry  we</span><span>  are  of  course  unable  to  state  who  is  to  blame</span><span>  -  if  anyone,  for  the  misadventure  of the</span><span>  Caroline.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  THE  MURDER  OF  MISS  SINCLAIR.-  At  the</span><span>  late  sittings  of  the  Circuit  Court  at  Mary-</span><span>  borough,  before  His  Honor  Mr.  Justice  Lut-</span><span>  wyche,  the  case  of  Brandy,  the  aboriginal,  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  for  the  murder  of  Miss  Sinclair,  at  Knock-</span><span>  break,  was  disposed  of,  and  the  following</span></p> <p><span>  notice  of  the  trial  is  taken  from  the  Chronicle:</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Pring,  instructed  by  Mr.  Keane,  from  the</span><span>  Attorney-General's  office,  prosecuted  on  be-</span><span>  half  of  the  Crown,  and  Mr.  P.  A.  Cooper  de-</span><span>  fended  the  prisoner.  During  the  hearing  of</span><span>  the  case  Mr.  Cooper  took  objection  to  a  state-</span><span>  ment  made  by  prisoner  being  put  in  evidence</span><span>  against  him,  inasmuch  as  he  (the  prisoner)</span><span>  had  not  received  the  customary  caution  before</span><span>  making  such  statement.  Mr.  Pring  having</span><span>  addressed  the  jury,  Mr.  P.  A.  Cooper  followed,</span><span>  and  made  an  able  defence  on  behalf  of  the</span><span>  prisoner.  The  Judge  then  summed  up,  and</span><span>  having  charged  the  jury,  they  retired  for  a</span><span>  short  time,  and  brought  in  a  verdict  of  man-</span><span>  slaughter.  The  Judge  passed  a  sentence  of</span><span>  five  years  on  the  prisoner.</span></p> <p><span>  MARYBOROUGH  IMMIGRANTS.-During  these</span><span>  stirring  times,  when  candidate  after  candidate</span><span>  is  thundering  forth  what  he  will  do  for  the</span><span>  future  good  of  Maryborough,  the  following</span><span>  facts  anent  the  doings  of  ""  New  Chums,""  may</span><span>  be  interesting  (says  the  Maryborough</span><span>  Chronicle)  to  our  readers.  During  the  last</span><span>  four  months,  three  ships  have  landed  some-</span><span>  thing  like  1000  immigrants  in  one  town,  and  a</span><span>  large  number  of  them  have  found  work  and</span><span>  are  doing  well  in  this  district.  But  how</span><span>  many  go  elsewhere  to  seek  employment?</span><span>  Probably  ten  per  cent.  Of  the  passengers</span><span>  who  landed  ex  ""Glamis,""  on  the  30th  of  May,</span><span>  we  know  of  twenty-five  who  have  left  for</span><span>  other  colonies,  and  others  intend  to  follow.</span><span>  Of  those  who  arrived  a  week  ago  per  Caroline,</span><span>  seventeen  have  already  paid  their  own  passage</span><span>  money,  and  proceeded  to  Sydney,  while</span><span>  upwards  of  thirty  have  sailed  for  Brisbane.</span><span>  This  shows  a  direct  loss  to  the  colony,  from</span><span>  the  last  importation  alone,  calculated  at</span><span>  £16  5s.  per  head,  of  £276  5s.  Surely  some-</span><span>  thing  should  be  done  to  remedy  this.</span></p> <p><span>  WEEDING  OUT  THE  UNPROFITABLE  COWS.</span></p> <p><span>  -  If  any  class  of  farmers  need  ""line upon</span></p> <p><span>  line  ""  to  induce  them  to  see  the  road  to  suc-</span><span>  cess,  it  is  the  dairymen.  They  keep  cows  for</span><span>  the  supposed  profit  they  bring,  and  they  live</span><span>  in  blissful  ignorance  that  they  are  doing  this</span><span>  labour  for  amusement  ;  yet  they  seldom  make</span><span>  any  enquiry  into  the  actual  performance  of</span><span>  any  individual  cow.  They  make  no  effort  to</span><span>  separate  the  good  from  the  bad  - the profitable</span><span>  from  the  unprofitable.  To  a  large  class  of</span><span>  dairymen  a  cow  is  a  cow,  and  they  do  not</span><span>  like  to  make  an  invidious  discrimination  ;  so</span><span>  they  go  on,  year  after  year,  keeping  cows  that</span><span>  do  not  pay  for  the  food  they  eat.  We  have</span><span>  often  endeavoured  to  arouse  dairymen  to  the</span><span>  necessity  of  testing  the  performance  of  indi-</span><span>  vidual  cows,  for  it  is  a  serious  loss  to  keep</span><span>  five  to  ten  cows,  or  perhaps  half  of  the</span><span>  herd,  that  do  not  return  compensation</span><span>  for  their  food.  We  have  known  several</span></p> <p><span>  herds  that  paid  so  poor  a  return  that</span><span>  the  owners  became  so  discouraged,  and  con-</span><span>  cluded  that  dairying  must  usually  be  carried</span><span>  on  without  reasonable  profit  ;  but  on  testing</span><span>  the  individual  yield  and  quality  of  these</span><span>  herds,  it  was  found  in  one  case  that  the  loss</span><span>  was  made  on  three  cows  out  of  eight,  the  five</span><span>  paying  a  reasonable  profit,  whilst  the  three</span><span>  poor  ones  sunk  this  ;  in  another  case  eight</span><span>  cows  sunk  the  profit  on  twenty.  There  is</span><span>  seldom  a  herd  of  twenty  cows  that  does  not</span><span>  contain  one  or  more  that  are  kept  at  a  loss.</span><span>  The  selection  of  cows  should  be  considered</span></p> <p><span>  one  of  the  first  practical  principles  of  dairying.</span><span>  The  cow  is  the  machine  to  work  out  the  dairy-</span><span>  man's  profit  ;  and  if  he  is  quite  careless  in  the</span><span>  selection  of  this  machine  he  cannot  expect</span><span>  success.  Now,  it  is  very  easy  for  every  dairy-</span><span>  man  to  test  the  yield,  in  pounds,  of  each</span><span>  cow  by  weighing  the  milk  of  each  separ-</span><span>  ately  one  day  in  a  week,  or  even  one</span><span>  in  two  weeks.  All  these  weighings</span><span>  added  together,  and  divided  by  the</span><span>  the  average  daily  yield  of  the  cow,  and  this</span><span>  multiplied  by  the  number  of  days  she  has</span><span>  given  milk  will  give  her  yield  per  season.</span></p> <p><span>  Then  the  quantity  may  be  tested  by  setting</span><span>  a  portion  of  the  milk  of  each  cow,  after</span><span>  mingling,  so  as  to  get  an  average  quality,  in  a</span><span>  glass  tumbler.  These  glass  tumblers,  all</span><span>  being  of  one  height,  will  hold  the  same</span><span>  depth  of  milk.  When  the  cream  rises  the</span><span>  glass  will  show  its  depth  and  colour.  This</span><span>  will  enable  the  dairyman  to  see  just  the</span><span>  quality  of  milk  each  cow  gives,  and  having</span></p> <p><span>    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p><span>  got  the  quantity  in  the  weighings  he  is  now</span><span>  prepared  to  determine  the  cows  he  wants  to</span><span>  sell.  Let  every  dairyman  begin  this  test  this</span><span>  spring,  and  weed  out  all  his  poor  cows  the</span><span>  coming  season.-National  Livestock  Journal.</span></p> <p><span>  A  CANDID  CULPRIT.  -  At the Clonmel</span><span>  Sessions  a  man  was  brought  up  for  trial  on  a</span><span>  charge  of  stealing.

Cecilia  Merkel,  a  child  of  seven</span><span>  years,  was  attacked  first  by  diphtheria,  next</span><span>  by  reflex  paralysis,  and  finally  by  sanguínea</span><span>  purpurea,  and  her  life  was  despaired  of.  Her</span><span>  father,  who  is  a  physician,|consented  to  have the</span><span>  experiment  of  blood  transfusion  tried.  Blood</span><span>  was  taken  from  the  veins  of  a  young  man  of  18,</span><span>  and  injected  with  a  syringe  into  the  child's</span><span>  system.  Subsequently  the  little  one  took</span><span>  cold  and  began  coughing,  with  a  mucous</span><span>  rattle  in  her  throat,  so  that  the  father  was</span><span>  compelled  to  afford  artificial  respiration.  He</span><span>  then  took  blood  from  the  veins  of  his  servant,</span><span>  a  healthy  girl  of  19,  and  the  effect  of  the</span><span>  transfusion  was  charming.  Thc  child  fell  into</span><span>  a  peaceful  sleep,  and  a  remarkable  change</span></p> <p><span>  came  over  her.

She  said  she  had</span><span>  already  applied  to  Mr.  Avory,  the  officer  of</span><span>  the  court,  and  he  had  referred  her  to  his  lord-</span><span>  ship.  Mr.  Avory  said  the  applicant  had</span><span>  applied  to  him  to  have  bills  preferred  for  the</span><span>  offences  she  had  mentioned  in  order  that  they</span><span>  might  be  sent  before  the  grand  jury,  but  the</span></p> <p><span>  circumstances  were  of  such  a  nature  that  he</span><span>  had  declined  to  do  what  she  requested  unless</span><span>  he  received  an  express  order  to  do  so  from  the</span><span>  court.  Mr.  Commissioner  Kerr  asked  the</span></p> <p><span>  applicant  to  state  the  circumstances  upon</span><span>  which  she  grounded  her  application  for  per-</span><span>  mission  to  prefer  these  bills  before  the  grand</span><span>  jury.  The  applicant  said  she  was  the  widow</span><span>  of  a  gentleman  who  had  formerly  filled  the</span><span>  position  of  magistrate  in  Tasmania,  and  who</span><span>  upon  retiring  from  that  office  came  to</span><span>  England,  and  went  to  reside  at  Kensington.</span><span>  While  at  this  house  she  said  that</span><span>  her  husband  was  murdered,  that  a  will  was</span><span>  forged  by  the  parties  who  committed  the  mur-</span><span>  der,  and  probate  was  obtained  to  this will,</span><span>  and  the  parties  had  obtained  possession  of  all</span><span>  his  property.  She  charged  them  all  with  con-</span><span>  spiracy  to  murder,  also  with  having  committed</span><span>  forgery  and  perjury  to  carry  out  their  object</span><span>  of  obtaining  possession  of  her  husband's  pro-</span><span>  perty.  She  said  that  she  had  made  an</span><span>  application  to  the  magistrate  at  Hammersmith</span><span>  Police  Court  for  a  warrant  against  the  parties,</span><span>  but  he  had,  for  some  reason  or  other,  declined</span><span>  to  interfere,  and  she  had  also  applied  at  Scot-</span><span>  land  Yard  to  Superintendent  Williamson,  but</span><span>  he  informed  her  that  he  could  not  interfere,</span><span>  and  that  the  only  thing  she  could  do  was  to</span><span>  apply  to  the  Court  of  Queen's  Bench  for  a</span><span>  mandamus  to  compel  the  magistrate  to  issue  a</span><span>  warrant.  Being  under  the  impression,  how-</span><span>  ever,  that  his  lordship  had  the  power  to  assist</span><span>  her,  she  asked  for  permission  to  lay  these  bills</span><span>  before  the  grand  jury  and  to  ask  for  a  man-</span><span>  damus.  The  Commissioner  told  the  applicant</span><span>  he  had  no  power  to  grant  a  mandamus  to  the</span><span>  magistrate,  and  he  did  not  feel  justified  in  per-</span><span>  mitting  her  to  prefer  these  bills  before  the</span><span>  grand  jury.-European  Mail.</span></p> <p><span>  A  RUSSIAN  PROTECTORATE  OF  TURKEY.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Morning  Post,  tracing  Russian  intrigue</span><span>  in  the  opposition  which  has  been  offered  to</span><span>  the  Austrian  occupation  of  Bosnia  and  Her-</span><span>  zegovina,  says:-""For  half  a  century  back</span><span>  we  know  that  the  plan  of  Russian  intrigue,</span><span>  a  plan  pursued  with  rare  assiduity  and  re-</span><span>  markable  success,  has  been  to  induce  the</span><span>  Porte,  by  persuasion  or  by  force,  to  accept</span><span>  the  '  protection  '  of  the  Czars  as  the  least</span><span>  onerous  form  of  that  European  interference</span><span>  which  the  Government  of  Constantinople</span><span>  was  constantly  assured  to  be  in  any  case  ine-</span><span>  vitable.  That  plan  has  not  been  abandoned</span><span>  even  since  the  results  of  the  Russo-Turkish</span><span>  war.  The  Treaty  of  San  Stefano  was</span><span>  intended  to  be  the  monstrous  and  clumsy</span><span>  realisation  of  the  cherished  design,  but  its</span><span>  greedy  author  had  overshot  his  mark,  and  the</span><span>  reawakened  public  spirit  of  England  and  the</span><span>  rising  resentment  of  Turkish  patriots  pro-</span><span>  duced  the  limitation  of  Muscovite  cupidity</span><span>  to  be  secured  in  the  protocols  of  the  Berlin</span><span>  Congress.  But  the  plan  of  Russian  'protec-  &nbsp;</span><span>  tion'  is  still  a  cherished  one,  and  eminent</span><span>  manipulators  of  facts,  such  as  are  the</span><span>  able  agents  for  which  Russian  diplomany  is</span><span>  renowned,  have  not  despaired  of  carrying  out</span><span>  upon  the  new  basis  of  the  Berlin  Treaty  the</span><span>  arrangement  intended  to  secure  to  St.  Peters-</span><span>  burg  the  predominance  in  the  East.  It  is  easy</span><span>  to  mock  at  the  possibility  of  such  an  apparent</span><span>  chimera,  and  it  is  certain  that  so  long  as  the</span><span>  British  Government  remains  firmly  adverse  to</span><span>  the  hesitations  which  marred  the  influence  of</span><span>  the  country  not  a  great  while  ago  Turkey  is</span><span>  secure  from  the  wiles  and  threats  of  Muscovite</span><span>  intriguers.  But  it  must  be  remembered  that</span><span>  Russia  has  never  placed  herself  before  the</span><span>  Porte  in  any  affected  guise  of  unselfish  friend-</span><span>  ship.  Her  agents  have  been  much  too  shrewd</span><span>  for  so  clumsy  a  manoeuvre.

British  philan-</span><span>  tropy  may  seem  to  have  taken  a  new  turn,</span><span>  and  decided  upon  ""assisted  emigration""  for</span><span>  cats,  instead  of  consigning  them  to  the</span><span>  sausage-makers.

However,  it  is  not  probable  that</span><span>  these  speculations  of  a  mystical  philosophy</span></p> <p><span>  have  influenced  Lord  Beaconsfield  and  his</span><span>  advisers  in  sending  a  shipment  of  cats  to</span><span>  Tristan  d'Acunha.  It  is  rather  part  of  that</span><span>  splendid  Imperial  policy  which  has  raised</span><span>  England  to  such  a  high  position  during  the</span><span>  last  few  months.

It  seems  that</span><span>  most  of  the  ladies  who  took  part  in  the</span><span>  festivity  brought  babies  with  them,  and  the</span><span>  noisy  perversity  of  the  infants  prevented  their</span><span>  mothers  from  enjoying  the  dance.  A  number</span><span>  of  young  men,  actuated  apparently  by  kindly</span><span>  motives,  gallantly  volunteered  to  take  charge</span><span>  of  the  little  ones  while  the  parents  indulged</span><span>  in  an  old  Virginia  ""breakdown.""  These</span><span>  mischievous  young  men,  however,  when  left</span><span>  in  charge  of  the  babies,  immediately  set  to</span><span>  work  and  changed  the  clothes  of  their  innocent</span><span>  charges,  giving  the  apparel  of  one  to  the</span><span>  other.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  dance  the</span></p> <p><span>  mothers,  anxious  to  return  home,  hurriedly</span><span>  snatched  up  each  a  baby  in  the  dress  of  her</span><span>  own,  and  started  off,  some  to  their  homes  ten</span><span>  or  fifteen  miles  off,  utterly  unconscious  of  the</span><span>  trick  that  had  been  played  upon  them.  At day-</span><span>  break  there  was  general  commotion  in  the</span><span>  district.  Mothers  discovered  to  their  horror</span><span>  that  a  single  night  had  changed  in  many</span><span>  instances  even  the  sex  of  their  babies,  and</span><span>  then  commenced  ""some  of  the  tallest  female</span><span>  pedestrianism  on  record.""  Living  miles</span><span>  apart  it  took  them  three  or  four  weeks  to</span><span>  unmix  the  babies,  and  fears  are  entertained</span><span>  that  it  will  take  as  many  months  to  restore  the</span><span>  indignant  mothers  to  their  naturally  sweet</span><span>  dispositions.

Should  the  Bank  of  England  require,</span><span>  as  most  likely  it  will  require,  to  augment  its  &nbsp;</span><span>  reserve,  it  must  do  so  by  bidding  higher  not</span><span>  only  than  the  Bank  of  France,  but  than  the</span><span>  Bank  of  Berlin.  Germany  has  paid  so  much</span><span>  for  establishing  its  gold  circulation  that  it  will</span><span>  be  sure  to  be  willing  to  raise  its  rate  to  retain</span><span>  it.  Meanwhile,  we  understand  that  since  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  rate,  both  of  the  Bank  of  Germany  and  the  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  outside  market  of  that  country,  'has  been  for</span><span>  some  time  higher  than  that  of  the  Bank  of</span><span>  England,  far  fewer  bills  on  England  have  been</span><span>  held  in  Germany  than  was  the  case  some  time</span><span>  since.  While  at  the  present  moment  the</span><span>  amount  of  paper  payable  at  a  comparatively</span><span>  short  date  is  sterling,  whether  strictly  com-</span><span>  mercial  paper  or  Treasury  bills,  held  in  France,</span><span>  is  unprecedentedly  large,  the  corresponding</span><span>  amount  of  paper  of  a  similar  class  held  in  Ger-</span><span>  many  is  by  no  means  abnormally  increased,</span><span>  but  is,  on  the  contrary,  smaller  than  it  was</span><span>  say,  two  years  since.  It  hence  follows</span><span>  that  if  either  the  Bank  of  England  and</span><span>  the  Bank  of  Berlin  desires  to  protect  its</span><span>  reserve  it  must  do  so  by  raising  the  rate.  The</span><span>  very  large  amount  of  Treasury  bills  now</span><span>  floating  may  not  only  be  a  disturbance  to  our</span><span>  money  market,  but  of  great  inconvenience  to the</span><span>  Government  should  any  of  the  numerous  issues</span><span>  now  current  have  to  be  renewed  at  a  moment</span></p> <p><span>  of  stringency.  Borrowing  at  short  dates  to</span><span>  lend  at  long  is  a  policy  which  is  sure  to  lead</span><span>  eventually  to  inconvenience,  which,  in  this</span><span>  case,  may  have  to  be  participated  in  both  by</span><span>  the  Government  and  by  ordinary  borrowers  in</span><span>  the  general  market,  who  may  find  their  usual</span><span>  business  undesirably  interfered  with  by  the</span><span>  action  of  one  large  borrower  with  such  heavy</span><span>  requirements.  Should  the  Government,  how-</span><span>  ever,  fund  any  considerable  part  of  the  present</span><span>  floating  debt,  the  effect  on  our  market  would</span><span>  be  different,  but  might  not  be  more  advan-</span><span>  tageous  to  the  Bank  of  England.  In  this  case</span><span>  the  foreign  holders  of  the  existing  Treasury</span><span>  bills,  who  would  thus  be  deprived  of  their</span><span>  security,  might  decline  to  take  stock  for  their</span><span>  money  ;  and  if  they  were  unable  to  find  good</span><span>  English  commercial  bills  at  the  moment,  might</span><span>  cause  inconvenience  to  the  bank  by  requiring</span><span>  cash  for  the  paper  which  they  had  formerly</span></p> <p><span>  held.""</span></p> ",Article,1878-10-28,"The morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

But  he  did  not  regard  the  object</span><span>  for  which  that  meeting  had  been  called</span><span>  as  one  of  a  party  character  at  all.  As</span><span>  colonists,  we  are  too  far  removed  from</span><span>  the  mother  country  for  it  to  be  a  matter</span><span>  of  immediate  concern  whether  Mr.  Glad-</span><span>  stone  or  Lord  Beaconsfield  is  Premier.</span><span>  These  and  other  remarks  of  similar  tenor</span><span>  formed  a  good  preface  to  the  Chief</span><span>  Justice's  speech,  and  had  their  spirit</span><span>  been  scrupulously  maintained  throughout,</span><span>  the  result  would  have  been  very  different</span><span>  fromwhatactuallytookplace.  The  desire</span><span>  of  the  promoters  of  the  meeting  was  to</span><span>  induce  the  citizens  of  Sydney,  in  public</span><span>  meeting  assembled,  as  a  loyal  and  order</span><span>  loving  community,  and  as  subjects  of  the</span><span>  British  Empire,  to  congratulate  Lord</span><span>  Beaconsfield  and  his  colleagues  for</span><span>  having  been  instrumental  in  securing  a</span><span>  peace  which  has  vindicated  the  public</span><span>  law  of  Europe,  and  which  has  at</span><span>  thc  same  time  maintained  the  honour  of</span><span>  the  British  Empire.  If  it  be  true,  as</span><span>  assumed,  that  the  Beaconsfield  Ministry</span><span>  have  secured  these  grand  results,  they</span><span>  may  fairly  be  congratulated  upon  broad</span><span>  national  grounds  for  their  success.</span></p> <p><span>  Sir  James  Martin,  however,  whilst  pro-</span><span>  fessing  noble  sentiments  and  disclaiming</span><span>  all  party  intentions,  allowed  himself  to</span><span>  be  betrayed  into  making  an  invidious</span><span>  comparison  between  the  policy  of</span><span>  English  Conservatives  and  Liberals,</span><span>  extolling  the  one  in  unmeasured  terms,</span><span>  and  with  equal  vehemence  disparaging</span><span>  the  other.  He  even  went  out  of  his</span><span>  way  to  inform  his  hearers,  at  least</span><span>  by  implication,  that  the  integrity  of</span><span>  the  Empire  depended  upon  the</span><span>  Conservative  parly  in  the  mother</span><span>  country,  and  pointed  out  that  Mr.</span><span>  Gladstone  and  those  associated  with  him</span><span>  had  favoured  the  Goldwin  Smith  theory,</span><span>  and,  when  in  power,  had  taken  some</span></p> <p><span>  steps  to  give  it  effect,  holding  that  it  j</span><span>  would  be  better  for  the  United  Kingdom</span><span>  and  the  Colonies  to  be  separated  ;  and</span><span>  they  only  withdrew  from  the  position</span><span>  they  had  assumed  on  this  question  when</span><span>  clear  and  decided  expressions  of  public</span><span>  opinion  in  the  mother  country  convinced</span><span>  them  that  it  was  utterly  untenable.</span><span>  A  more  effectual  course  could  hardly</span><span>  be  taken  to  enlist  the  sympathies</span><span>  of  a  colonial  audience  in  favour</span><span>  of  the  English  Conservative  leaders  to</span><span>  the  disparagement  of  the  leaders  of  the</span><span>  Liberal  interest,  than  to  make  it  appear</span><span>  that  the  one  upholds  whilst  the  other</span><span>  undervalues  thc  importance  of  maintain-</span><span>  ing  the  integrity  of  the  Empire.  The</span><span>  great  principles  which  distinguish  Con-</span><span>  servatives  from  Liberals  in  the  old  coun-</span><span>  try  are  in  operation  here,  though  per-</span><span>  haps  in  a  less  degree  ;  and  it  is  not  sur-</span><span>  prising  that  Sir  James  Martin's  party</span><span>  preferences  gave  offence  to  a  portion  of</span><span>  his  audience.  Sydney  has  always  been</span><span>  noted  for  the  rowdy  character  of  its  poli-</span><span>  tical  gatherings,  and  the  late  meeting  in</span><span>  the  Masonic  Hall  was  by  no  means  an</span><span>  honourable  exception  in  this  respect.</span><span>  Sir  James  Martin's  speech  provoked</span><span>  noise,  confusion,  and  angry  expressions</span><span>  of  dissent,  and  these  expressions</span><span>  seem  to  have  provoked  him  to  say</span><span>  things  which  he  had  never  intended.</span><span>  He  referred  to  the  ""  humiliating  ""  pos</span><span>  tion  into  which  Mr.  Gladstone  and  his</span><span>  party  had  brought  the  country  somefour</span><span>  and-twenty  years  ago  ;  cast  upon  them</span><span>  the  odium  of  what  he  described  as  thal</span><span>  ""most  unjust,  one-sided,  and  arbitrary</span><span>  award""  in  the  Alabama  case,  alluding</span><span>  also  to  the  San  Juan  award  in  a  similar</span><span>  strain  of  remark.  But  he  seemed,  in  these</span><span>  cases,  to  confound  the  award  with  this</span><span>  policy  of  referring  the  dispute  to  arbitra-</span><span>  tion,  and  at  the  same  time  to  have</span><span>  forgotten  that  a  Conservative  Govern-</span><span>  ment  preceding  Mr.  Gladstone's  entered</span><span>  into  a  convention  with  the  Government</span><span>  of  the  United  States,  under  which  it  was</span><span>  agreed  that  the  Alabama  claims  should</span><span>  be  referred  to  Commissioners  for  adju-</span><span>  dication,  and  that  before  the  Com-</span><span>  missioners  proceeded  to  consider  any  of</span><span>  them,  the  two  Governments  were  to  fix</span><span>  upon  some  sovereign  or  head  of  a</span><span>  friendly  State  as  arbitrator;  the  Glad-</span><span>  stone  Ministry  simply  carried  out  that</span><span>  policy,  and  its  beneficial  effects  are</span><span>  now  too  apparent  to  leave  room  for</span><span>  cavil.  The  two  great  branches  of  the</span><span>  Anglo-Saxon  race,  which  were  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  -  ATMae-""*""  u^ar.jiáJ»  cauli  other,  have  Ivon</span></p> <p><span>  drawn  together  in  terms  ot  friendship</span><span>  and  amity.  These  improved  relations</span><span>  rendered  marked  service  during  the</span><span>  last  few  months,  when  Russia  was</span><span>  desirous  of  securing  American  aid  in  the</span><span>  event  of  possible  hostilities  with  Great</span><span>  Britain,  but  her  advances  met  with  a  cold</span><span>  reception.</span></p> <p><span>  These  questions,  however,  were  all</span><span>  far-fetched  and  inappropriate  to  the</span><span>  object  of  the  late  meeting  in  Sydney,</span><span>  and  their  introduction  only  tended  to</span><span>  create  discord  and  divide  the  meeting</span><span>  into  hostile  factions.  The  resolution</span><span>  moved  by  Sir  James  Martin  needed</span><span>  delicate  handling.  There  are  many</span><span>  things  in  the  policy  of  Earl  Beaconsfield</span><span>  and  the  term  upon  which  a  peaceful</span><span>  settlement  has  been  arrived  at,  that  were</span><span>  fair  subjects  for  controversy.  The  or-</span><span>  dering  of  Indian  troops  in  readiness  for</span><span>  service  in  Europe,  the  conclusion  of  a</span><span>  treaty  with  Turkey  secretly  and  before</span><span>  Parliament  had  been  consulted  in  the</span><span>  matter,  the  occupation  of  Cyprus,</span><span>  the  acceptance  of  a  protectorate  over</span><span>  Asia  Minor,  and  the  undertaking  to</span><span>  guarantee  the  integrity  of  the  Sultan's</span><span>  Asiatic  realm-these  are  all  matters</span><span>  upon  which  opinion  will  differ  widely.</span><span>  In  all  probability  the  policy  of</span><span>  the  Government,  as  a  whole,  was  the</span><span>  best  that  could  have  been  adopted.</span><span>  The  situation  was  critical,  and  justified</span><span>  resort  to  extraordinary  measurer.  But</span><span>  their  justification  under  such  circum-</span><span>  stances  must  depend  largely  upon  their</span><span>  ultimate  success.  Had  failure  been  the</span><span>  result,  Lord  Beaconsfield  would  have</span><span>  had  to  bear  the  full  weight  of  blame,  and</span><span>  would  probably  have  been  regarded  as</span><span>  scarcely  less  vile  than  a  traitor  to  his</span><span>  country  ;  but  his  boldness  and  decision</span><span>  have  succeeded  at  a  time  when  strict</span><span>  adherence  to  conventional  rule  might</span><span>  have  led  to  disastrous  consequences.</span><span>  He  is  therefore  entitled  to  the  congratu-</span><span>  lations  of  all  well-wishers  of  the  Empire,</span><span>  without  distinction  of  party.  These</span><span>  might  be  freely  accorded  without  ignoring</span><span>  the  possible  share  which  Messrs.  Glad-</span><span>  stone,  Bright,  and  others  may  have  had</span><span>  in  bringing  about  the  desired  result.</span><span>  The  Beaconsfield  Government  acted</span><span>  with  firmness  and  decision  in  maintain-</span><span>  ing  treaty  engagements;  but  they  are</span><span>  not  entitled  to  all  the  credit  of  defending</span><span>  what  Sir  James  Martin  aptly  terms  ""  the</span><span>  public  law  of  Europe.""

M.  Herald  Bays  that</span><span>  the  pubbc  meeting  on  the  29th  ultimo,  at  the</span><span>  -Masonic  Hall,  convened  with  a  view  to  con-</span><span>  gratulate  Earl  Beaconsfield  on  his  recent</span><span>  diplomatic  successes,  although  of  a  very  in-</span><span>  fluential  character,  was  not  so  one-minded  as</span><span>  to  receive  with  unquestioning  approbation  the</span><span>  address  in  support  of  the  principal  motion,  or</span><span>  to  declare  with  anything  like  decisiveness  for</span><span>  thc  British  Premier's  action  in  the  late</span></p> <p><span>  difficulty  regarding  Eastern  affairs  and</span></p> <p><span>  Russian  dominance.  Chief-Justice  Martin's</span><span>  vigorous  speech  in  moving  the  motion  of  the</span><span>  evening  was  hailed  alternately  with  applause</span><span>  and  hostile  interruption.  Sir  John  Hay,  in</span><span>  seconding  the  motion,  had  a  good  reception,</span><span>  though  his  address  was  not  listened  to  with-</span><span>  out  opposition  and  Borne  show  of  impatience.</span><span>  The  question  then  before  the  meeting  was</span><span>  that  it  should  congratulate  the  Earl  of</span><span>  Beaconsfield  and  his  colleagues  upon  the</span></p> <p><span>  successful  termination  of  their  labours  in</span></p> <p><span>  defence  of  the  public  law  of  Europe,  and  in</span><span>  securing  thc  blessings  of  peace,  whilst</span><span>  resolutely  maintaining  the  honour  and</span><span>  interests  of  the  empire.  The  opposition  to</span><span>  this  motion  was  lcd  by  Mr.  David  Buchanan,</span><span>  who  moved  an  amendment  expressing</span><span>  approval  of  thc  conduct  of  Mr.  Bright  and</span><span>  Mr.  Gladstone  in  restraining  the  Government</span><span>  of  Earl  Beaconsfield  from  plunging  England</span><span>  into  a  senseless  and  ruinous  war.  When  the</span><span>  vote  of  the  meeting  came  to  bc  taken,  the</span><span>  original  motion  was  declared  by  the  chairman</span><span>  to  have  been  carried  by  an  overwhelming</span><span>  majority.  This  decision,  however,  has  been</span></p> <p><span>  questioned  by  many  who  were  present.  A</span></p> <p><span>  public  meeting  at  Newcastle  carried  a  resolu-</span><span>  tion  of  similar  purport.</span></p> <p><span>  AUSTRALIA  AT  THE  PARIS  EXIUWTION.</span></p> <p><span>  The  following  is  given  by  the  Argus  as  an</span><span>  extract  from  a  private  letter  written  by  a</span><span>  Victorian  colonist  now  at  home,  who  has</span><span>  recently  paid  a  visit  to  the  Paris  Exhibition  :</span><span>  -""The  Victorian  court  I  consider  tbe</span><span>  greatest  failure  in  the  whole  Exhibition.  It</span><span>  occupies  a  conspicuous  position,  but  there  ia</span><span>  an  utter  absence  of  taste  or  judgment  in  the</span><span>  arrangements.  The  centre  of  it  is  taken  up</span><span>  with  a  large  pedestal,  occupied  by  four  wax</span><span>  figures  (bte  size)  from  the  Melbourne  Wax-</span><span>  works,  viz.,  a  blackfellow,  a  lubra,  a</span><span>  pickanniny,  a  stockrider,  and  a  digger.  These</span><span>  are  intended  to  represent  and  are  charateristic</span><span>  of  the  colony  of  Victoria  !  The  next  notice-</span></p> <p><span>  able  exhibit  is  a  pyramid  of  bottles  of  colonial</span></p> <p><span>  wine,  only  remarkable  because  of  the  dirty</span><span>  labels.  There  are  two  or  three  cases  of  wool,</span><span>  or  perhaps  half-a-dozen  ;  but  I  fear  the  wool</span><span>  Êrowers  who  sent  bales  of  wool  will  reap  very</span></p> <p><span>  ttle  advantage  from  thc  examination  of  the</span><span>  sample.  Just  fancy  an  American-Bhaped</span><span>  waggon  stuck  in  an  out-of-the-way  part  of  the</span><span>  building,  with  thc  bales  piled  up  in  the</span><span>  ordinary  way,  and  a  few  inches  of  thc  baling</span><span>  cut  out  of  the  ends  of  the  bales.  It  would  take  a</span><span>  tall  man  with  keen  sight  to  be  able  to  dis-</span><span>  cover  even  greasy  from  wnBhed  wool.</span><span>  Altogether,  the  whole  of  the  arrangements</span><span>  are  bad,  and  not  tho  slightest  effort  spears  to</span><span>  be  made  to  bring  the  colony  prominently</span><span>  under  the  notice  of  tho  public.

New  South  Wales  and</span></p> <p><span>  South  Australia  have  managed  altogether</span><span>  differently,  and  their  exhibits  are  really  very</span><span>  creditable.

"<p><span>  ROCKIÍAMITON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  DECEMUIÎR  Ifl,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  EVERY  one  interested  in  solving  the</span><span>  problem  how  to  make  the  surplus  live</span><span>  stock  of  Australia  available  to  the  British</span><span>  consumer,  will  hear  of  tho  course  taken</span><span>  by  the  Brisbane  Frozen  Meat  Com-</span><span>  mittee  with  disappointment.  That</span><span>  body  was  appointed  at  an  influential</span><span>  meeting  of  stockowners  sonic  four</span><span>  months  ago,  and  it  was  doing  good  work.</span><span>  It  was  also  successful  in  securing  the</span><span>  services  of  exceptionally  intelligent  and</span><span>  persevering  agents  in  the  mother  country.</span></p> <p><span>  Messrs.  Buchanan  and  Mcilwraith  evi-</span></p> <p><span>  dently  found  the  work  imposed  upon</span><span>  them  a  labour  of  love.  They  made</span><span>  diligent  inquiries,  and  through  Messrs.</span><span>  B.  D.  Morehead  and  Co.,  have  placed  a</span><span>  quantity  of  trustworthy  information  before</span><span>  the  Committee,  and,  through  them,  before</span><span>  the  stockowners  of  the  «olony.  It  is</span><span>  now  settled  beyond  controversy  that</span></p> <p><span>  frozen  carcases  can  be  delivered  in</span><span>  London  in  a  perfect  state  of  preserva-</span><span>  tion,  and  little  if  at  all  inferior  to  fresh</span><span>  killed  meat.  The  experiment  to  which</span><span>  the  late  Mr.  T.  S.  Mort  devoted  so  many</span><span>  years  of  his  life,  and  so  large  a  sum  of</span><span>  money,  has  been  made  by  others,  and</span><span>  though  doubts  are  entertained  of  the</span><span>  commercial  success,  the  practicability  of</span><span>  thc  business  has  been  established  beyond</span><span>  cavil.  And  now  a  further  invention</span><span>  appears  to  have  been  made.  Messrs.</span><span>  Mort  and  Nicholle  attempted  to  perfect</span><span>  a  system  of  preservation  by  means  of</span><span>  coldcompressedair.  They  failed,  butother</span><span>  men  have  apparently  succeeded,  and  there</span><span>  is  every  reason  to  hope  that  ere  long</span><span>  the  new  process  will  be  made  available.</span><span>  The  patentees  are  men  of  great</span><span>  experience  in  the  American  meat</span><span>  trade,  and  they  evidently  are  not  dis-</span><span>  posed  to  underrate  the  value  of  their</span><span>  invention.  The  terms  they  seek  to  im-</span><span>  pose  for  die  use  of  their  patent  are,  as</span><span>  the  Brisbane  Committee  decided,  exor-</span><span>  bitant.  The  price  asked  for  the</span><span>  machinery-,£2000-is  moderate,  and</span><span>  contrasts  favourably  with  the  expenses</span><span>  of  the  apparatus  on  board  the  Paraguay.</span><span>  But  the  condition  that  our  stockowners</span><span>  should  put  ,£10,000  into  a  proposed</span><span>  English  company,  the  extent  of  whose</span><span>  capital  is  not  even  mentioned,  is  un-</span><span>  reasonable,  as  is  also  the  guarantee  de-</span><span>  manded  as  to  the  number  of  carcases  to</span><span>  be  shipped.  The  royalty  of  20s.  a-head</span></p> <p><span>  on  bullocks  and  25.  6d.  on  sheep,  is  not  j</span><span>  i  only  exorbitant  but  prohibitory.  These,</span></p> <p><span>  however,  are  but  the  first  demands  of</span><span>  men  who  think  they  have  got  hold  of  a</span><span>  good  thing,  whose  value  it  is  impossible  at</span><span>  present  to  estimate.  But  it  will  be  useless</span><span>  until  tried,  and  we  may  safely  say  that  it</span><span>  never  ivilJ  be  tested  on  such  terms.  That</span><span>  fact  will  soon  bring  the  patentees</span><span>  to  their  senses,  and  possibly  elicit  from</span><span>  them  a  more  sensible  proposal.  The</span><span>  meat  trade  will  be  large,  but  it  will  bear</span><span>  no  such  impost  as  the  patentees  demand.</span><span>  The  £1  per  head  is  evidently  based</span><span>  on  the  suggestion  that  the  patentee  is</span><span>  entitled  to  a  royalty  of  a  farthing  per</span><span>  pound.  In  a  country  where  fresh</span><span>  killed  meat  ranges  at  fron  ninepence  to</span><span>  fifteenpence,  the  farthing  looks  like  a</span><span>  very  small  fraction  of  the  value.  Hut</span><span>  looked  at  from  an  Australian  producer's</span><span>  point  ol  view  thc  proposal  assumes  an</span><span>  entirely  different  aspect.  The  grazier</span><span>  will  be  satisfied  with  £fi  the  bullock,</span><span>  15s.  the  100  lbs.,  or  id.  4-sths  per  lb.</span><span>  A  royally  of  one  farthing  per  lb.  there-</span><span>  fore  means  just  one-seventh  of  the</span><span>  grazier's  price,  and  probably  one-half  his</span><span>  net  profit.  The  expense  of  breeding,</span><span>  fattening,  and  driving  to  market  consumes</span><span>  thc  greater  proportion  of  the  £(>  which</span><span>  thc  grazier  receives  for  his  bullock,</span><span>  and  the  royalty  of  J£I  would  reduce  the</span><span>  net  price  to  £1,  which  can  be  obtained</span><span>  by  boiling,  without  incurring  the  risk  and</span><span>  unknown  expense  of  the  freezing  pro-</span><span>  cess,  and  the  fluctuations  of  distant</span><span>  markets.  The  zs.  Cd.  on  every  sheep</span><span>  is  a  still  greater  imposition,  amounting,</span><span>  as  it  does,  lo  more  than  one  half-penny</span><span>  per  lb.  of  meat.  The  patentees  have</span><span>  evidently  been  badly  advised.  They</span><span>  appear  to  assume  that  the  new  process</span><span>  should  bc  utilised  for  their  own  benefit,</span><span>  instead  of  for  the  benefit  of  the  producer</span><span>  or  thc  general  public.  They  will  soon</span><span>  discover  their  mistake,  however,  and  then</span><span>  will  be  amenable  to  reason.</span></p> <p><span>  Wc  quite  agree  with  Mr.  Alfred</span><span>  Hrown  iliat  it  is  unwise  on  the</span><span>  part  of  the  Committee  to  let  the</span><span>  frozen  meat  project  drop.  A  sub-</span><span>  committee  might  at  least  have</span></p> <p><span>  been  appointed  lo  draft  a  letter</span><span>  in  reply  to  Messrs.  Buchanan  and</span><span>  M'llwrailh,  setting  forth  the  views  of  the</span><span>  Committee,  and  possibly  making  a</span><span>  suggestion  for  a  trial-  shipment.  The</span><span>  trouble  would  not  have  been  great,  and</span><span>  thc  results  might  h  ive  been  important.</span><span>  As  Mr.  Brown  further  pointed  out,  if  the</span><span>  dry  air  refrigerating  apparatus  costs  only</span><span>  _¿j2O00  and  is  cheaply  worked,  it</span><span>  would  bc  an  invaluable  adjunct  to  a</span><span>  meat  preserving  establishment.  We</span><span>  hear  much  of  the  superior  get  up  of  the</span><span>  American  meats,  and  are  in  doubt</span><span>  whether  thc  cattle  are  superior  or  the</span><span>  manipulation  more  perfect.  Bu:  the</span><span>  ice  chamber  used  so  freely  at  Chicago</span><span>  probably  explains  everything.  In  our</span><span>  meat  manufactures,  the  bullock  is</span><span>  killed  ;  and  the  meat  placed  in</span><span>  the  tins  for  cooling  while  yet</span><span>  warm,  livery  housewife  knows  the</span><span>  superior  quality  of  hung  beef  when</span><span>  thc  temperature  is  sufficiently  low  to</span><span>  admit  of  the  meat  being  kept  willi</span><span>  safety.  Owners  of  meat  manufactures</span><span>  also  know  thc  loss  sustained  by  enforced</span><span>  suspension  of  work  during  at  least  one</span><span>  third  of  the  year.  The  dry-air</span><span>  refrigerator  would  just  meet  this  case,</span><span>  and  enable  thc  manufacture  to  lie  driven</span><span>  almost  constantly  throughout  the  entire</span><span>  year.  Thc  only  stoppage  then  oc-</span><span>  curring  would  be  limited  to  a  few</span><span>  exceptionally  hot  days,  when  it  would  be</span><span>  inadvisable  to  heat  the  cattle  by  yarding</span><span>  them  under  a  melting  sun.</span></p> <p><span>  It  appears  to  us  that  the  Brisbane</span><span>  Committee  have  abdicated  their  func-</span><span>  tions,  and  resolved  themselves  into  a  body</span><span>  to  establish  a  meat  manufactory  in</span><span>  the  southern  portion  of  thc  colony.  They</span><span>  were  appointed  to  investigate  a  matter</span><span>  not  only  of  Queensland  but  of  Austra-</span><span>  lian  interest.  They  appear  to  have  de-</span><span>  generated  into  a  Committee  to  arrange</span><span>  for  re-opening  the  Oakey  Creek  works,</span><span>  and,  failing  that,  to  set  up  a  few  steam</span><span>  boiling  pot  within  easy  reach  of  their</span><span>  runs.  This  may  be  a  praiseworthy</span><span>  object,  for  there  is  a  present  and  pro</span><span>  pective  surplus  to  be  dealt  with.  There</span><span>  are  thousands  of  bullocks  and  sheep  in</span><span>  Queensland  at  this  moment  eating  theil</span><span>  heads  off,  and  they  must  if  practicable</span><span>  be  turned  almost  immediately  into  cash.</span><span>  But  surely  that  might  have  been  under-</span><span>  taken  hy  the  Committee  as  a  subsidiar)</span><span>  object.  Thc  future  surplus  stock  ol</span><span>  Australia  will  not  all  be  marketable  ir</span><span>  the  form  of  ""  compressed  corned  beef</span><span>  preserved  by  the  Melbourne-Chicago  pro</span><span>  cess.  The  British  consumer  would  soon</span><span>  tire  of  such  fare,  and  he  would  rather  paj</span><span>  a  higher  price  by  far  for  an  uncooked</span><span>  and  inferior  joint.  Thc  meat  problerr</span><span>  will  never  be  solved  until  Australian</span></p> <p><span>  joints  can  be  sold,  as  the  American  joint!</span><span>  are,  in  direct  competition  with  English</span><span>  fresh-killed  meat.  There  will  be  a  large</span><span>  demand  for  tinned  meat,  but  Chicago</span><span>  and  even  Melbourne,  enjoy  climatic</span><span>  advantages  to  which  wc  in  Queensland</span><span>  cannot  lay  claim.  What  our  meat  manu</span><span>  facturers  need  for  unequivocal  success</span><span>  even  in  tinning  meat,  is  the  ice  chamber</span><span>  or  its  equivalent  in  the  cold  dry-air  diam</span><span>  ber.  If  the  Brisbane  Committee  had  beer</span><span>  alive  to  the  necessity  of  the  times,  there</span><span>  fore,  we  think  they  would  have  kept  thc</span><span>  refrigerating  processes  steadily  in  view</span><span>  and  have  spared  no  trouble  in  persever</span><span>  ing  attempts  to  carry  out  the  prime</span><span>  object  for  which  they  were  original])</span><span>  appointed.</span></p> <p><span>  Thc  members  of  tho  Garrick  Amateur</span><span>  Dramatic  Club  give  a  performance  to-night</span><span>  for  thc  benefit  of  thu  North  Rockhampton</span><span>  race  fund.

The  driver  of  the  coach  from</span><span>  Gympie,  Luke  O'Malley,  arrived  at  Gootchie  at</span><span>  the  usual  hour,  about  11  o'clock,  where  he  met</span><span>  the  coach  from  Maryborough,  driven  by</span><span>  Louis  Bamberger,  with  one  passenger-Mr.</span><span>  Muir,  assayer-for  Gympie.  Before  starting</span><span>  O'Mally  warned  Louis  to  be  careful  on  crossing</span><span>  the  Gootchie  culvert,  about  two  hundred  yards</span><span>  further  on,  os  thc  culvert  was  deep  under</span><span>  water,  and  hw  might  miss  the  roadway.  The</span><span>  latter  then  drove  on,  and  shortly  after  Mr.</span><span>  Muir  returned  in  breathless  haste  to  inform</span><span>  them  that  Louis  had  gone  a  little  off  the  track</span><span>  the  coach  had  toppled  over  the  side  of  the</span><span>  culvert,  and  had  sank  and  the  two  horses</span><span>  wore  drowned,  and  that  Louis  was  clinging</span><span>  for  his  life  to  a  small  tree.  O'Malley,  with  all</span><span>  speed,  hastened  to  the  spot,  where  he  found</span><span>  Louis  as  described.  He  immediately  swam</span><span>  out  and  told  Louis  how  to  hold  on  to</span><span>  him  so  that  he  could  swim  with  him,</span></p> <p><span>  but  the  poor  fellow  got  frightened,  and</span><span>  to  savehimself  O'Malley  had  to  get  rid  of  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  him,  when  Louis  seized  another  small  tree,</span><span>  and  held  on.  Mr.  Muir  then  got  a  short  rope</span><span>  and  passed  it  round  the  body  of  Louis,  with  a</span><span>  view  to  draw  him  to  land,  but  the  unfortunate</span><span>  man  drifted  behind  another  tree,  and  the  rope</span><span>  getting  foul,  he  sank  before  any  further  effort</span><span>  could  be  made  to  rescue  him,  and  his  body</span><span>  could  not  be  found.  A  message  was  sent  to</span><span>  Tiaro,  and  the  police  stationed  there  imme-</span><span>  diately  started  for  the  scene  of  the  accident.</span><span>  Until  the  water  has  greatly  receded,  the  re-</span><span>  covery  of  the  body  or  of  the  coach  and  mail</span><span>  bags  is  scarcely  likely  to  be  effected.  The</span><span>  culvert  where  the  accident  happened  is  a  very</span><span>  dangerous  one,  after  every  heavy  rain  the</span><span>  approaches,  for  a  long  distance,  being  under</span><span>  water,  there  being  no  rails  on  the  culvert  or</span><span>  any  guide  whatever  to  mark  the  road  across</span><span>  it.  Louis  had  on  several  occasions  pointed</span><span>  out  the  spot  to  his  passengers  as  one  at  which</span><span>  at  some  time  a  fearful  accident  would  happen.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  FINANCIAL  CRISIS.-The  S.

Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Harding,  instructed  by  Messrs.  Roes  R.

Thc  statement  of  claim  sets</span><span>  out  that  recently  the  vessel  referred  to  arrived</span><span>  at  Rockhampton,  having  on  board  a  quantity</span><span>  of  salt,  galvanized  iron,  and  Holloway's  pills.</span><span>  These  goods  were  thc  property  of  the  plaintiff,</span><span>  who  held  certain  bills-of-lading  in  respect</span><span>  thereof.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  OCTOBER.  8,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  differences  of  pnlir.y  hntvinm</span><span>  Ministerialists  and  Oppositionists  are  so</span><span>  slight  that  candidates  will  find  some</span><span>  difficulty  in  adopting  the  programme  of</span><span>  either,  unless  previous  experience  in</span><span>  Parliament  enables  them  to  read  the</span><span>  respective  leaders'  utterances  between</span><span>  the  lines.  The  real  divergencies  between</span><span>  the  dozen  most  influential  men  in  the</span><span>  late  Assembly  are  of  a  non-party</span><span>  character.  The  personal  opinions  of</span><span>  Mr.  Douglas  differ  as  little  from  those  of</span><span>  Mr.  M'llwraith  as  from  those  of  either</span><span>  of  the  gentlemen  on  the  Treasury  front</span><span>  benches.  Mr.  Griffith,  on  many  subjects,</span><span>  is  more  Conservative  thananyleading  man</span><span>  on  the  Opposition  side,  but  having  been</span><span>  identified  with  a  certain  party  he  re-</span><span>  mains  connected  with  it,  and  possibly</span><span>  tempers  its  policy.  The  same  may  be</span><span>  said  of  Mr.  Garrick,  who  fancies  he</span><span>  sees  in  the  scars  of  the  deadlock</span></p> <p><span>  period  the  best-defined  lines  of  party</span><span>  demarcation,  for  when  at  a  loss</span><span>  for  an  argument  he  at  once</span><span>  hoists  the  scarlet  rag  of  squatting  ascen-</span><span>  dancy.  Mr.  Dickson's  political  opinions</span></p> <p><span>  are  devoid  of  colour,  and  so  far  as  they  ]</span><span>  go  he  might  hold  the  finance  portfolio  in  '</span><span>  almost  any  possible  Ministry  without</span><span>  appearing  out  of  place  on  party  grounds.</span><span>  There  may  be  a  Conservative  shade  in</span><span>  the  opinions  of  the  Opposition  leaders,</span><span>  but  it  is  scarcely  discernible  since  the</span><span>  I  extreme  squatters  among  their  supporters</span></p> <p><span>  have  left  the  House,  and  comparatively</span><span>  new  men  of  known  liberal  opinions  and</span><span>  sympathies  have  identified  themselves</span><span>  with  the  party.  On  the  whole,  therefore,</span><span>  the  constituencies  will  do  well  to  ignore</span><span>  party  distinctions,  and,  having  satisfied</span><span>  themselves  on  the  score  of  ability  and</span><span>  trustworthiness,  vote  for  the  candidates</span><span>  displaying  most  of  those  desirable  quali-</span></p> <p><span>  ties.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Ministerial  journals,  unable  to</span><span>  discover  serious  fault  in  thc  opinions  and</span><span>  conduct  of  the  Opposition  leaders,  have</span><span>  attempted  to  fasten  upon  their  party  the</span><span>  peccadilloes  of  its  subordinate  members,</span><span>  who  use  the  liberty  of  free  lances  not</span><span>  only  without  the  permission  of  their  chief</span><span>  but  in  direct  antagonism  to  his  wish.  As</span><span>  well  might  the  Premier  be  held  respon-</span><span>  sible  for  the  narrow  speeches  of  Mr.</span><span>  Grimes,  the  eccentricities  of  Mr.  Bailey,</span><span>  or  the  coarseness  of  Mr.  Foote.  And</span><span>  theorising  journalists  entirely  lose  sight</span><span>  of  the  circumstance  that  an  Opposition</span><span>  by  virtue  of  its  office  attacks,  while  Min-</span><span>  isterialists  repel.  And  as  Ministers  fight</span><span>  behind  departmental  trenches,  and  have</span><span>  means  of  information  denied  to  private</span><span>  members,  they  may  be  expected  to  fall</span><span>  into  fewer  mistakes.  However,  we  be-</span><span>  lieve  the  conduct  of  the  Opposition  in</span><span>  the  last  Parliament  compares  favourably</span><span>  with  that  of  any  of  its  predecessors.  It</span><span>  never  attempted  obstruction  except  for</span><span>  the  temporary  and  justifiable  purposes  of</span><span>  preventing  rash  legislation  or  getting</span><span>  Imore  information  than  theGovernmenthad</span></p> <p><span>  previously  condescended  to  vouchsafe  ;</span><span>  and  by  comparison  with  the  persistent  ob</span></p> <p><span>  struction  of  the  so-called  Liberal  Party</span><span>  eight  or  nine  years  ago,  the  Opposition</span><span>  successively  lcd  by  Messrs.  Palmer  and</span><span>  M'llwraith  have  been  exemplary  in  their</span></p> <p><span>  conduct.  Yet  ive  admit  that  there  is  '</span><span>  still  room  for  improvement,  and  that</span><span>  the  misdeeds  ol  one  party  is  hut  a  pour</span><span>  excuse  for  the  failings  of  another.</span></p> <p><span>  The  must  nbsnrhin;  public:  topics</span><span>  during  the  elections  .ire  likely  to  he</span><span>  those  connected  will)  finance  and  railway</span><span>  extension.  Thc  light  will  lie  chiefly</span></p> <p><span>  !i_tween  thc  advócales  of  trunk  railways  ,</span><span>  and  branch  railways.  The  agricultural</span><span>  districts  of  the  coast  feeling  the  neces-</span><span>  sity  of  improved  means  of  transit  for</span><span>  their  produce,  are  clamorous  for  the</span><span>  suspension  of  the  trunk  lines  and  the  con-</span><span>  centration  of  the  whole  constructive</span><span>  energy  of  the  Government  upon  tho</span><span>  carrying  out  of  branches.  We</span><span>  think  that,  with  thc  exception</span><span>  of  some  electors  interested  in  Glad-</span><span>  stone  n.vn  lots,  the  opinion  of</span><span>  the  constituencies  of  the  Central  districts</span><span>  is  decidedly  with  the  party  who  want  to</span><span>  push  on  the  trunk  lines.  One-third  of</span><span>  the  people  of  Central  Queensland  live  in</span><span>  Rockhampton,  for  example.  They  cer-</span><span>  tainly  do  nut  want  their  trunk  line</span><span>  stopped  beyond  Emerald  Downs  in</span><span>  order  that  branch  lines  may  be  under-</span><span>  taken  in  East  and  West  Moreton  and</span></p> <p><span>  Darling  Downs.  Yet  there  are  a  few</span><span>  electors  in  Rockhampton  who,  bedazzled</span><span>  by  the  well-sounding  name  of  the</span><span>  Liberal  Party,  would  cut  their  own</span><span>  throats  and  injure  the  best  interests  of</span><span>  the  country  by  returning  men  to  identify</span><span>  themselves  with  the  branch  line  party.</span><span>  We  know  what  were  the  ""  Liberal  ""  pro-</span><span>  tests  entered  against  thc  Westwood  and</span><span>  Comet  extension  six  years  ago,</span><span>  and  we  ought  to  be  aware  also</span><span>  that  but  for  the  firm  stand  taken</span></p> <p><span>  by  the  Opposition  last  session  no</span><span>  provision  would  have  been  made  for</span><span>  carrying  the  line  beyond  Emerald  Downs.</span><span>  We  know  too,  how  Mr.  Douglas,  to</span><span>  please  the  supporters  of  the  Government</span><span>  and  to  divide  thc  people  of  Clermont</span><span>  and  Rockhampton,  kept  dangling  the</span><span>  Clermont  route  for  our  main  line  for</span><span>  years  before  the  public  ;  and  it  was  not</span><span>  until  he  found  engineering  opinion  could</span><span>  not  be  got  to  favour  thc  Clermont</span><span>  deviation,  that  he  succumbed  to  geogra-</span><span>  phical  necessities  and  the  paramount</span><span>  wish  of  the  people  of  the  Central</span><span>  districts.  And,  even  now,  what  is  the</span><span>  Premier's  policy?  Why,  to  nominally</span><span>  adopt  the  trunk  line  system  forced  upon</span><span>  him  by  the  Opposition,  but  to  rt</span><span>  quire  that  beyond  Roma  and  Emerald</span><span>  Downs  the  railways  shall  be  carried  out</span><span>  by  private  enterprise  or  by  some</span><span>  development  of  the  land  grant  system.</span><span>  This,  we  are  informed  by  wire  from</span><span>  Brisbane,  is  the  evident  tenor  of  his</span><span>  election  address,  although  his  declara-</span><span>  tions  therein  arc  rather  ambiguous  on  the</span><span>  subject.  The  Treasurer,  however,  dis-</span><span>  tinctly  opposes  the  further  extension  of</span><span>  trunk  lines  into  the  Interior,  unless  by</span><span>  the  proceeds  of  sales  of  land,  but  favours</span><span>  the  making  of  railways  in  agricultural</span><span>  districts.  From  these  and  previous</span><span>  utterances,  there  is  no  room  to  doubt</span><span>  that  the  present  Ministry  are  opposed  to</span><span>  any  further  extension  of  our  trunk  lines</span><span>  by  means  of  loan  funds,  and  are  anxious</span><span>  of  drawing  as  fully  as  possible  upon  the</span></p> <p><span>  credit  and  financial  resources  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  colony  for  the  making  of  branch</span><span>  linc».  If  thia  is  What  thc  people</span><span>  of  Rockhampton  and  the  Central  districts</span><span>  want,  or  if  it  is  deemed  calculated  to</span><span>  promote  the  best  interests  of  the  country,</span><span>  we  are  very  much  mistaken  indeed.</span><span>  And  the  Ministerial  policy  is  thc  more</span><span>  palpably  wrong,  because,  while  they</span><span>  would  borrow  no  more  money  for  trunk</span><span>  lines,  they  would  construct  branch  lines,</span><span>  which  pass  chiefly  through  private  lands,</span><span>  at  the  sole  cost  of  thc  taxpayers.  The</span><span>  Opposition  say  that  the  western  lands</span><span>  will  amply  pay  for  the  trunk  lines,  and</span><span>  that  if  non-paying  branch  lines  are  to  be</span><span>  undertaken,  the  owners  of  lands  bene-</span><span>  fited  will  have  to  make  good  the  deficit</span><span>  in  the  event  of  branch  railways  not  pay-</span><span>  ing  working  expenses  and  interest  upon</span><span>  capital.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Griffith  will  be  in  Rockhampton</span><span>  during  the  current  week,  and  already</span><span>  carrying  three  portfolios  on  his  back,  may</span><span>  be  esteemed  the  defacto  Liberal  Ministry</span><span>  of  the  future.  Those  who  think  we</span><span>  misrepresent  the  policy  of  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  therefore,  had  better  get  a  public</span><span>  avowal  from  Mr.  Griffith  on  the  railway</span><span>  views  and  projects  of  himself  and  col-</span><span>  leagues.  He  is  now  the  Minister  of</span><span>  Works,  and  cannot  allege  that  the  matter</span><span>  is  beyond  his  province.  Nor  can  he  say</span><span>  it  is  a  matter  of  public  policy  on  which</span><span>  the  Premier  alone  can  pronounce,  for</span><span>  everybody  in  Brisbane  appears  to  believe</span><span>  that  Mr.  Griffith  will  be  the  Premier  of</span><span>  the  Ministry  who  meet  the  new  Parlia-</span><span>  ment  next  January.  If  Mr.  Griffith's</span><span>  trip  be  in  any  sense  an  electioneering</span><span>  tour,  it  would  surely  suit  his  purpose  to</span><span>  state  plainly  his  opinions  and  intentions</span><span>  in  regard  to  trunk  versus  branch  railways.</span><span>  If  he  refuse  to  state  them,  the  electors</span><span>  will  be  able  to  form  their  own  conclu-</span><span>  sions,  and  come  to  an  intelligent  deter-</span><span>  mination  in  regard  to  their  action  in  the</span><span>  forthcoming  elections.</span></p> <p><span>  TnE  first  number  of  the  Qwnwland  Punrh</span><span>  has  reached  us.

It  is  impossible</span><span>  to  give  a  just  idea  of  this  part  of  the</span><span>  performance  by  description  ;  but  no  ouc</span><span>  who  likes  good  music  should  let  thc</span><span>  opportunity  of  hearing  it  pass  by.

That  journal  in  a  leading  article</span><span>  on  his  rotircment  says,  that  while  their  late</span><span>  member  undoubtedly  made  mistakes  in  thc</span><span>  carly  part  of  his  Parliamentary  career,  he  had</span><span>  gained  thc  experience  requisite  to  make  him</span><span>  a  good  member,  and  that  during  tho  last</span><span>  session  ho  rendered  thc  constituency  really  good</span><span>  sevvice.  There  are  many  electors  in  thc</span><span>  Clermont  electorate  who  would  be  glad  to</span><span>  retain  him  as  their  member,  and  thc  prevailing</span><span>  opinion  seems  to  ho  that  they  may  go  farther</span><span>  aud  faro  worse  ;  but  he  has  distinctly  refused</span><span>  to  stand  for  re-election.  He  says:-""My</span><span>  reason  for  not  seeking  re-election  at  Clermont</span><span>  in  particular  is,  that  I  cannot  afford  the  time</span><span>  to  ¡lay  frequent  visits  to  the  electorate  ;  and</span><span>  as  I  am  aware  that  a  gentleman  largely</span><span>  interested  in  your  district,  and  who  neces-</span><span>  sarily  has  a  more  intimate  knowledge  of  it  than</span><span>  myself,  is  willing  to  offer  bis  services  as  your</span><span>  representative,  I  consider  it  my  duty  to  waive</span><span>  auy  claim  I  may  have  to  your  support  in  his</span><span>  favour.""  The  Telegram  considers  that,  ""under</span><span>  the  circumstances,  the  rcasnn  is  valid.  Thc</span><span>  head  and  front  of  our  late  member's  offending,</span><span>  as  alleged  during  the  late  political  démonstra-</span><span>  tions,  was  that  he  hail  neglected  his  con-</span><span>  stituency,  by  passing  and  repasting  without</span><span>  calling  to  inquire  coucerning  local  wants  ;  and</span><span>  Mr.  Stevenson,  assuming,  as  a  seemingly</span><span>  inevitable  deduction  from  thc  logic  nf  facts,</span><span>  that  thc  future  member  for  Clermont  must  bc</span></p> <p><span>  a  good  visitor,  declines,  in  view  of  this  KÏIH</span><span>  i/im  timi,  to  again  solicit  the  suflY.igos  of  the</span><span>  electors.

There  cannot  be  any  doubt  that  the</span><span>  permanent  closing  of  Mr.  Duster's  excellent</span><span>  establishment  would  be  a  matter  for  public</span><span>  regret,  and  to  many  residents  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Central  Districts  its  loss  would  be  felt</span><span>  very  keenly.  We  trust,  therefore,  that</span><span>  this  evening's  deliberations  will  have  a  prac-</span><span>  tical  outcome  of  a  favourable  character.  The</span><span>  Turkish  Bath,  with  its  buildings  and  appli-</span><span>  ances,  will  be  submitted  unreservedly  to</span><span>  public  auction  on  Thursday  next,  the  10th</span><span>  instant,  so  that  if  any  steps  are  to  be  taken  to</span><span>  keep  the  establishment  open,  it  is  requisite</span><span>  that  they  be  taken  at  once.

Tho  following  cases  wero  disposed  of,</span><span>  and  resulted  in  the  prisoners  in  each  case  be-</span><span>  ing  acquitted  :-dlichard  Rogers,  wounding</span><span>  with  intent  to  murdor  John  Moore,  at  Copper-</span><span>  field,  by  striking  him  on  thc  face  with</span><span>  an  axe  ;  William  Watson,  an  intelligent</span><span>  looking  half  caste,  murdering  an  aboriginal</span><span>  woman  named  Sally,  at  Bowen  Downs  Station  ;</span><span>  and  Samuel  Ainsley  Norman  alias  ""The</span><span>  Doctor,""  larceny  of  a  horse.  The  two  former</span><span>  prisoners  wero  defended  by  counsel,  but  the</span><span>  latter  prisoner,  who  was  on  remand  from  the</span><span>  lastsittings,  conducted  hisown  defence  in  avery</span><span>  ingenious  manner,  and  made  a  plausible  ad-</span><span>  dress  to  the  Jury.  On  his  discharge  from</span><span>  custody,  bc  was  immediately  apprehended  for</span><span>  horsestealing  and  conveyed  to  thc  lock-up.</span><span>  The  prisoner  will  be  brought  before  thc  Police</span><span>  Magistrate  this  morning,  and  remanded  to</span><span>  Springsure,  where  the  offence  is  alleged  to  be</span><span>  committed.  Thc  Court  rose  at  G'20  p.m.,  and</span><span>  resumes  proceedings  till  this  morning  at  ten</span></p> <p><span>  o'clock.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  cull  from  tho  IPcvito'ii  Star  of  28th</span></p> <p><span>  September  the  prominent  facts  of  a  thunder-</span><span>  storm  which  occurred  in  Roma  on  Friday,</span><span>  27th  September,  and  which  is  described  as</span><span>  one  of  tho  most  noient  and  destructive  within</span><span>  thc  knowlcdge'of  tho  oldeBt  inhabitant  of  the</span><span>  district.  About  noon  on  tho  day</span><span>  mined,  dense  masses  of  clouds  began</span><span>  to  gather,  and  at  a  few  minutes  to  1  o'clock</span><span>  some  fearf  ul  thunder  claps  broke  over  the  town,</span><span>  accompanied  by  a  succession  of  lightning</span><span>  flashos.  Tho  raiu  carno  down  in  sheets,  and</span><span>  the  darkness  that  prevailed  for  the  iwvt  fim></span><span>  minutes  was  enough  to  fill  thc  most  stout-</span><span>  hearted  with  awe.  The  force  of  tho  wind,</span><span>  too,  was  something  terrific,  causing  very</span><span>  general  damage  to  proporty,  but  fortunately</span><span>  no  loss  of  life.  Bark-roofed  houses  and  out-</span><span>  buildings  havcall  Buffered  more  orlcss,  and  large</span><span>  trees  were  cut  down  as  by  the  axeman.  Thc</span><span>  two  side-walls  of  thc  gaol  yard,  os  well  as  tho</span><span>  fence  dividing  the  malo  and  female  depart-</span><span>  ments,  are  totally  destroyed  aud  laid  flat  on</span><span>  tho  ground.  In  the  police  department  a</span><span>  portion  of  thc  iron  roof  of  the  sergeant's  kitchen</span><span>  was  stripped  and  carried  a  distance  of  over</span><span>  500  yards.  The  new  establishment  of  tho</span><span>  Roma  Butchering  Company  had  the  gabie  end</span></p> <p><span>  blown  in  several  inches.  One  of  thc  sheets  of</span><span>  roolingfromahousc  in  Arthur-street  was  carried</span><span>  up  in  the  air  and  lodged  in  the  branches  of</span><span>  a  tree  fifty  yards  distant.  Mr.  H.  Albion's</span><span>  new  cottage  was  lifted  clcau  off  thc</span><span>  foundations,  and  fell  a  heap  of  ruins  around  its</span><span>  occupiers,  a  woman  sustaining  injuries  to  her</span><span>  head  and  face  through  tho  falling  of  the  chim-</span><span>  ney.  Thc  children  in  tho  State  school  were</span><span>  much  frightened  by  the  blast  against  thc</span><span>  building,  and  a  tank  belonging  to  Slr.  Recs,</span><span>  holding  three  or  four  casks  of  water,  was</span><span>  actually  lifted  into  the  air  and  carried  a  con-</span><span>  siderable  distance.

"<p><span>  rvooiciiAtiirTQif.</span></p> <p><span>  ^  SATURDAY,  OCTOBER  5,  1878.  /</span></p> <p><span>  -v-  fx</span></p> <p><span>  THE  decision  arrived  at  by  the  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  Municipal  Council  on  Thursday</span><span>  afternoon  last,  to  enter  immediately</span><span>  upon  what  may  be  regarded  as  the  first</span><span>  instalment  of  a  system  of  sewerage  for</span><span>  the  town,  is  one  of  great  importance,</span><span>  and  should  be  undertaken  with  every</span><span>  care  to  avoid  possible  mistakes  which</span><span>  might  at  a  future  time  prove  a  source</span><span>  of  much  inconvenience  and  expense.</span><span>  The  primary  object  of  the  work</span><span>  immediately  contemplated,  is  to  assist</span><span>  the  storm  water  drainage,  which  is</span><span>  already  provided  for,  though  imperfectly,</span><span>  by  open  water  tables  and  cuttings.  It</span><span>  is  proposed  to  lay  down  brick  circular</span><span>  culverts  2ft.  6in.  diameter,  from  East</span><span>  street,  through  Stanley,  Derby,  William,</span><span>  and  Denham-streets,  to  the  river  ;  and</span><span>  down  Archer-street  to  the  present  cul-</span><span>  vert  at  the  corner  of  Bolsover-street.</span></p> <p><span>  These  culverts  will,  in  each  instance,</span><span>  run  under  the  middle  of  the  street,  and</span><span>  the  storm  waters  will  be  conducted</span><span>  into  them  by  means  of  stoneware</span><span>  pipes,  (15in.  diameter)  connecting  with</span></p> <p><span>  the  waler  channels  at  the  intersection  of</span><span>  the  cross  streets  with  East-street,  Quay-</span><span>  lane,  and  Quay-street.  This  will  un-</span><span>  doubtedly  render  good  service  in</span><span>  carrying  off  the  storm  waters,  and,</span><span>  provided  the  culverts  are  large  enough,</span></p> <p><span>  will  effectually  prevent  the  accumulation</span><span>  of  surface  waters  during  the  heaviest</span></p> <p><span>  rainfall.  The  asphalt  bed  intended  for</span><span>  the  water  channels  will  by  the  smooth-</span><span>  ness  and  cleanness  of  its  surface,  further</span><span>  contribute  to  the  same  end.  We  pre-</span><span>  sume  that  the  street  crossings  will</span><span>  also  be  put  in  good  repair,  and  if  practi-</span><span>  cable,  be  paved  with  stone  so  as  to  pre-</span><span>  vent  the  roadway  from  constantly  wearing</span><span>  into  holes,  as  is  now  the  case,  and  keep</span><span>  an  open  course  for  the  water  to  pass</span><span>  away  without  obstruction.</span></p> <p><span>  A  perfect  system  of  storm  water  drain-</span><span>  age,  such  as  is  contemplated,  will  con-</span><span>  tribute  greatly  both  to  the  public  health</span><span>  and  convenience  ;  but,  after  all  it  will</span><span>  be  only  an  instalment  of  the  drainage</span><span>  works  required.  It  is,  we  are  gratified  to</span><span>  observe,  intended  that  the  culverts</span><span>  about  to  be  constructed  shall  not  only</span><span>  serve  for  storm  waters,  but  also  for  house</span><span>  drainage,  and  that  they  are  to  be  supple-</span><span>  mented  by  a  system  of  small  sewers  for</span><span>  that  purpose,  embracing  the  most</span><span>  populous  portion  of  the  town.  This</span><span>  part  of  the  scheme  will  be  costly,  and</span><span>  we  do  not  see  how  it  can  be  undertaken</span><span>  without  a  special  loan,  secured  by  a</span><span>  special  rate  sufficient  to  cover  the  annual</span><span>  interest  charge  upon  the  cost  of  the</span><span>  work.  But  there  is  surely  no</span><span>  reason  why  this  should  not  be  under-</span><span>  taken.  The  preliminary  step  must  be</span></p> <p><span>  the  preparation  of  a  proper  scheme,  and</span><span>  the  requisite  plans  and  specifications,</span></p> <p><span>  with  estimates  of  cost.  The  sooner  this</span><span>  is  done  the  better,  as  time  will  be</span><span>  required,  in  the  first  place  to  elaborate</span><span>  the  scheme,  and  that  being  done,  the</span><span>  public  should  have  full  opportunity  of</span><span>  considering  and  discussing  it  in  all  its</span></p> <p><span>  bearings  before  the  work  of  construction</span><span>  is  entered  upon.  The  cost  being</span></p> <p><span>  ascertained,  and  being  found  not  \</span><span>  in  excess  of  a  sum  the  interest  j</span><span>  upon  which  could  be  met  by  a</span><span>  rate  of,  say,  sixpence  in  the  pound</span></p> <p><span>  on  the  properties  included  within  the  ;</span><span>  drainage  area,  it  would  then  remain  to</span></p> <p><span>  see  whether  the  money  could  not  be  i</span><span>  borrowed  for  the  purpose.  A  loan  for</span><span>  such  a  purpose  would  have  to  be  kept</span><span>  distinct  from  the  General  account-the</span><span>  new  Act  requires  that-and  the  works</span><span>  need  not  impose  any  charge  upon  the</span><span>  ordinary  revenue  except  for  main-</span><span>  tenance.  The  interest  on  the  special</span><span>  loan  being  met  by  a  special</span><span>  rate  on  the  properties  directly  bene-</span><span>  fited,  it  would  only  be  fair  that  the</span><span>  maintenance  of  thc  drains  in  an  efficient</span><span>  state  of  repair  should  bc  provided  for</span><span>  out  of  the  ordinary  current  revenue,</span><span>  seeing  that  the  drainage  would  be  of</span><span>  general  benefit  lo  the  whole  municipality,</span><span>  and  all  ratepayers  should  therefore  con-</span><span>  tribute  something  towards  the  expense</span><span>  it  entails.  Maintenance  and  interest</span><span>  being  provided  for,  the  works  might  very</span><span>  properly  be  classed  as  ""  permanent,""  and</span><span>  as  long  as  their  cost  could  bc  covered</span><span>  by  loan  without  causing  a  strain  upon</span><span>  the  financial  resources  of  the  Munici-</span><span>  pality  in  other  directions,  the  drainage</span><span>  debt  might  legitimately,  and  in  accord-</span><span>  ance  with  the  principles  recognised  by</span><span>  law  in  the  mother  country,  be  also  con-</span><span>  sidered  permanent,  as  ihe  works  would</span><span>  permanently  represent  an  equivalent</span></p> <p><span>  value.</span></p> <p><span>  The  line  of  action  we  have  thus</span><span>  sketched  out  will,  we  feel  assured,  meei</span><span>  with  general  approval,  and  it  especially</span><span>  devolves  U|)on  ihe  municipal  body  to  give</span><span>  j  it  their  earnest  consideration.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  one  point  in  referenre  to</span><span>  which  it  is  important  that  the  Mnynr</span><span>  an-.I  Aldermen  should  lie  thoroughly</span><span>  satisfied.  We  refer  to  tile  capacity  ol</span></p> <p><span>  j  thc  culverts  about  to  be  constructed  for</span></p> <p><span>  carrying  off  both  storm  utters  and  house</span><span>  drainage,  which  will  bi  directed  into</span><span>  them  when  ,  the  whole  scheme  is</span><span>  completed.  A  culvert-  of  2ft.  6in.</span><span>  diameter  does  seem  small  for  a</span><span>  main  drain.  Possibly,  however,  it  is</span><span>  sufficient  considering  the  limited  area  for</span></p> <p><span>  which  each  of  these  main  drains  is  to  do.</span></p> <p><span>  duly.  But  we  should  like  to  receive  an  '</span></p> <p><span>  assurance  that.-.the  size  has  been  deter-</span><span>  mined  upon  after  a  careful  calculation  of</span><span>  the  quantity  of  water  that  will  be</span><span>  conducted  into  them  during  our  heaviest</span><span>  rainfalls.  The  capacity  of  the  storm-</span><span>  water  culverts  in  Brisbane  is  regulated</span></p> <p><span>  by  the  requirements  for  a  rainfall  of  .</span><span>  two  inches  per  hour,  over  the  whole</span><span>  .watershed  of  each  culvert  or  system</span><span>  of  culverts  ;  and  that  being  the  basis  of  ;</span><span>  calculation,  the  culverts  arc  made  about</span><span>  one-third  larger  than  would  be  absolutely</span><span>  needed  for  such  a  rainfall.  The  question</span><span>  as  to  the  required  capacity  of  the  culverts</span><span>  proposed  here  has  doubtless  been  fully</span><span>  considered  by  Mr.  Clements,  but  it  is</span><span>  quite  possible  he  may  have  designed  his</span><span>  scheme  without  making  due  allowance</span><span>  for  the  advantages  that  would  accrue</span><span>  from  making  the  culverts  somewhat</span><span>  larger,  whilst  the  extra  cost  would  be</span><span>  coiwarativfily  trifling.</span></p> <p><span>  lt  should  be  borne  n,  j  :..  awtn,b</span><span>  with  this  subject  that,  whilst  the  carrying</span><span>  out  of  a  system  of  drainage  is  an  under-</span><span>  taking  requiring  much  time  as  well  as</span><span>  inoncp,  there  are  other  sanitary  improve-</span><span>  ments  which  might  as  well  be  initiated  at</span><span>  once  as  at  some  future  day.  An  efficient</span><span>  system  of  scavengering  by  Corporation</span><span>  men,  and  maintained  by  means  of  a</span><span>  cleansing  rate,  would  greatly  improve</span><span>  the  sanitary  condition  of  the  town,  and</span><span>  there  is  no  valid  excuse  to  justify  its</span><span>  postponement.  The  small  rate  required</span><span>  to  drfray  the  cost  of  keeping  the  town  in</span><span>  a  creditable  state  of  cleanliness  would</span></p> <p><span>  .amount  to  a  considerably  less  sum  in</span><span>  the  year  than  is  now  paid  for  emptying</span><span>  cesspits  and  removing  rubbish,  whilst</span><span>  the  plan  we  suggest  would  have  the  im-</span><span>  mense  advantage  of  being,  thorough  and</span><span>  of  general  application.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  services  in  connection  with  the  anni-</span><span>  versary  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  will,  to-</span><span>  morrow,  Ira  conducted  by  the  Rev.

On  Monday  last</span><span>  Mr.  Stanley,  in  company  with  Captain  Heath,</span><span>  Portmaster,  went  down  in  the  Bunyip  te</span><span>  North  Reef,  whore  the  now  lighthouse  is  being</span><span>  built.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  AUGUST  31,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  MR.  ANGUS  MACKAV  is  again  to  the</span><span>  fore  with  bis  ""low  cost""  railway.  He</span><span>  delivered  a  long  discussion  address  on  the</span><span>  subject  atSouth  Brisbane  onFriday  week,</span><span>  and  made  one  of  a  large  deputation  who</span><span>  waited  upon  the  Premier  on  the  Monday</span><span>  morning  following  to  urge  the  construction</span><span>  of  a  railway  between  South  Brisbane  and</span><span>  the  ""southern  coast.""  Wc  have  carefully</span><span>  looked  through  his  speech  as  reported,</span><span>  and  find  that  ""  low  cost  ""  means  using</span><span>  the  ordinary  roads  where  possible,  in-</span><span>  creasing  thc  maximum  of  inclines  to  one</span><span>  in  thirty  instead  of  the  present  maximum</span><span>  of  one  in  fifty,  using  timber  instead  of</span><span>  earth-work  in  many  places,  particularly</span><span>  in  rough  and  boggy  country,  and  saving</span><span>  two-thirds  the  ballast  at  present  laid</span><span>  down.  Besides  the  saving  in  construc-</span><span>  tion,  he  suggests  all  sorts  of  economies  in</span><span>  working,  the  chief  of  which  are  the  dis-</span><span>  pensing  with  stations  and  station-masters</span><span>  except  where  the  traffic  is  large,  and</span><span>  applying  to  the  railway  the  plan  of  having</span></p> <p><span>  a  ""  conductor  ""  to  whom  fares  shall  be</span><span>  paid,  as  in  the  case  of  an  omnibus  or</span><span>  stage-coach.  There  ts  much  good  in</span><span>  these  suggestions,  and  they  might  be</span><span>  with  advantage  adopted  on  the  branch</span><span>  lines-at  any  rate,  so  many  of  them  as</span><span>  after  due  examination  may  be  ap-</span><span>  proved  by  competent  persons.  Mr.</span><span>  Mackay's  strong  point,  however,  is</span></p> <p><span>  said  to  be  that  he  is  not  a</span></p> <p><span>  mere  theorist,  and  that  his  suggestions</span><span>  arc  not  original,  but  arc  based  entirely</span><span>  on  what  has  been  practically  demonstrated</span></p> <p><span>  in  America  and  other  countries.  We  have</span></p> <p><span>  before  expressed  distrust  of  his  strict</span><span>  accuracy,  and  find  in  his  latest  deliver-</span><span>  ance  proof  that  the  figures  he  cites  are</span><span>  to  be  received  with  caution.  Still  inquiry</span></p> <p><span>  leads  to  the  belief  that  his  scheme  is  at</span></p> <p><span>  least  worth  a  trial.  Whether,  as  he  sug-</span><span>  gests,  the  first  ""  low  cost  ""  line  should</span><span>  start  from  South  Brisbane  or  not,  is  a</span><span>  matter  on  which  opinions  will  differ.  It</span><span>  is  said  that  Mr.  Mackay  is  an  intending</span><span>  candidate  for  that  constituency,  which</span><span>  possibly  explains  the  discovery  he  has</span><span>  made  of  its  claims  to  secure  the  benefit  of</span><span>  the  first  branch  railway.  It  is  perfectly</span><span>  true,  however,  that  there  is  a  large  agri-</span><span>  cultural  community  settled  between</span><span>  Brisbane  and  the  southern  coast,  and</span><span>  thal  they  very  much  want  improved</span><span>  roads  of  some  kind.  But  the  proba-</span><span>  bility  is  that  if  the  equitable  claims  of</span><span>  all  the  districts  were  impartially  balanced</span><span>  and  if  due  consideration  were  given  to</span><span>  the  character  of  the  country  to  be</span><span>  traversed,  as  well  as  the  prospective</span><span>  traffic  it  would  yield,  the  first  branch  line</span><span>  would  be  made  between  the  Northern</span></p> <p><span>  Railway  near  Emerald  Downs  and</span><span>  Copperfield.  Here  an  opportunity</span><span>  offers  of  carrying  out  construction  by</span><span>  the  proceeds  of  sales  of  Crown  lands  ;</span><span>  for  the  line,  at  ^3000  a-mile,  would  not</span><span>  cost  more  than  ,£200,000,  which  should</span><span>  be  recouped  from  the  amount  impro-</span><span>  perly  spent,  as  we  hold,  in  carrying  out</span><span>  the  trunk  line.  Giving  due  considera-</span><span>  tion  to  the  agricultural  capabilities  of  the</span><span>  Peak  Downs,  and  to  the  large  amount  of</span><span>  mineral  traffic  the  line  would  un-</span><span>  doubtedly  carry,  we  think  it  has</span><span>  the  very  first  claim  to  consideration</span><span>  from  the  Government.  As  a  matter</span><span>  of  fact,  however,  if  there  be</span><span>  a  possibility  of  meking  railways  at</span><span>  ,£3000  a-mile,  there  would  be  scarcely</span><span>  a  settled  district  in  the  colony  which</span><span>  would  not  be  entitled  to  its  branch  line.</span><span>  Indeed,  the  colony,  under  such  circum-</span><span>  stances,  would  soon  become  a  network</span><span>  of  cheap  railways,  and  ordinary  roads</span><span>  would  be  almost  wholly  superseded.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Douglas  has  always  professed  to</span><span>  be  a  great  admirer  of  Mr.  Mackay  and</span><span>  his  ""low-cost""  system,  bul'although</span><span>  premier  of  a  Liberal  Government,  he</span><span>  lacks  the  force  to  commit  his  colleagues</span><span>  to  an  experiment.  He  can  and  does</span><span>  promise  railways  in  all  directions,  but</span><span>  appears  to  make  no  general  effort  to</span><span>  fulfil  his  promises.  To  the  deputation</span><span>  on  Monday  he  was  very  gracious,  and</span><span>  professed  sympathy  with  their  project,</span><span>  but  after  talking  in  a  circle  for  some</span><span>  minutes,  lie  gave  them  the  dubious</span><span>  encouragement  contained  in  the</span><span>  assurance  that  ""  until  we  could  get  a</span><span>  Minister  for  Works  to  take  the  matter</span><span>  vcr)'  much  to  heart,  and  who  would  bc</span><span>  prepared  to  stake  his  position  on  the</span><span>  scheme,  he  feared  the  time  to  change</span><span>  the  present  system  had  not  come.""</span><span>  This  was  not  particularly  cheering,</span></p> <p><span>  unless  it  be  taken  as  a  confession  that</span><span>  the  Liberal  Ministry  are  played  out,  or</span><span>  at  least  that  Mr.  Miles  should  give  way</span><span>  lo  a  ""  low-cost  ""  Minister  for  Works,</span><span>  the  confession  means  an  indefinite  post-</span><span>  ponement  of  cheap  railways.  Yet,  in  the</span><span>  same  speech,  Mr.  Douglas  said  the</span><span>  country  could  not  wait  for  cheap  lines</span><span>  until  provinces  on  the  New  Zealand</span><span>  model  were  constituted,  and  that  it</span><span>  would  be  hopeless  to  exact  guarantees</span><span>  under  the  Local  Government  Bill.  We</span><span>  should  be  glad  to  know  what  Mr.</span><span>  Douglas  really  means,  and  whether  he</span><span>  intended  to  amuse  the  deputation  hy</span><span>  building  castles  in  the  air,  or  merely</span></p> <p><span>  wished  to  divert  them  from  the  ""  low</span><span>  cost  ""  scheme.  The  only  satisfying</span><span>  point  we  can  lind  in  his  reply  is  the</span><span>  promise  that  as  soon  as  money  was</span><span>  available  a  line  between  South  Brisbane</span><span>  and  Beenleigh  should  be  surveyed.  That,</span><span>  perhaps,  is  what  thc  South  Bris</span><span>  banites  actually  warn.  They  care  little</span><span>  about  the  cost  so  long  as  their</span></p> <p><span>  side  of  tile  city  is  niáde  the</span><span>  terminus  of  some  railway,  to  -avert  its</span><span>  becoming  mere  suburban  sites  for</span><span>  elegant  villa  residences,  whose  occupants</span><span>  would  prefer  to  get  as  far  as  possible</span><span>  from  the  dust  and  .hurry  of  business</span><span>  slreets.  The  land-owners  in  South</span><span>  Brisbane  naturally  envy  the  fabulous</span><span>  prices  obtained  for  Queen-street  front-</span><span>  ages,  and  think  similar  good  fortune</span><span>  would  await  them,  could  a  railway  bc</span><span>  constructed  from  the  Victoria  Bridge  to</span><span>  the  southern  coast.  It  is  but  fair  to  add,</span><span>  however,  that  among  the  deputation  were</span><span>  Beenleyh  and  Logan  settlers  who  really</span><span>  appear  to  have  faith  in  the  low-cost</span><span>  system,  and  would  rather  have  a  light</span><span>  line  constructed  than  attempt  to  burden</span><span>  the  colony  with  an  extension  of  the</span><span>  existing  system  to  their  district.</span></p> <p><span>  To  those  who  distrust  the  present</span><span>  Ministry  in  this  particular,  it  must  be</span><span>  consoling  to  reflect  that  Mr.  Douglas  and</span><span>  his  colleagues  are  not  inevitable.  Mr.</span><span>  M'llivraith,  who  would  not  be  likely  t»</span><span>  commit  himself  to  an  impracticable</span><span>  idea,  has  expressed  the  belief  that</span><span>  branch  lines  eau  be  made  to  run  from</span><span>  eight  to  ten  miles  an  hour  at  the</span><span>  average  cost  of  .£3000  per  mile.  More-</span><span>  over,  in  his  schedule  of  items  for  the</span><span>  proposed  three-million  loan,  he  placed  no</span><span>  less  than  ¿£300,000  for  branch  lines.</span><span>  We  cannot  believe  that  he  did  this  with-</span></p> <p><span>  out  having  fully  considered  the  question,</span><span>  or  without  having  arrived  deliberately  at</span><span>  the  conclusion  that  light  and  inexpen-</span><span>  sive  lines  suitable  to  the  traffic  of  agri-</span></p> <p><span>  cultural  districts,  could  be  made.  .</span><span>  Perhaps  he  is  the  future  Minister  for</span><span>  Works  whom  Mr.  Douglas  refers  to  as</span><span>  the  man  ""  who  will  be  prepared  to  stake</span><span>  his  position  on  the  scheme.""  If  this  be</span><span>  the  Premier's  meaning,  we  cordially  agree</span><span>  with  him.  A  Ministry  who  profess  to</span><span>  entertain  definite  convictions  and  admit</span><span>  want  of  the  courage  necessary  to  cany</span><span>  them  out,  will  never  do  much  good  for</span><span>  their  own  reputations  or  the  people  of</span><span>  the  country.  The  sooner  effete  rulers</span><span>  of  this  kind  give  place  to  other  men,  the</span><span>  sooner  we  shall  see  liyht  railways  become</span><span>  a  practical  entity.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  thc  Police  Court,  yesterday,  before  the</span></p> <p><span>  Police  Magistrate,  the  assault  case  of  j</span></p> <p><span>  Elizabeth  Dunn'',  lilwardjoucs,  wasallowcdto  1</span><span>  bc  withdrawn  upon  the  application  of  the  I</span></p> <p><span>  complainant.</span></p> <p><span>  Tm-:  Hov.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  MARCH  4,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  late  rains,  follbwing  upon  a  severe</span><span>  drought,  have  had  the  effect  of  again</span><span>  arousing  the  attention  of  the  people  of</span><span>  Brisbane  to  the  urgency  of  carrying  on</span><span>  to  completion  the  work  of  city  drainage.</span><span>  Fortitude  Valley  is  particularly  unfortu-</span><span>  nate  in  regard  to  this  subject.  It  has</span><span>  grown  into  a  very  populous  suburb,  or</span><span>  rather  an  important  and  integral  part</span><span>  of  the  city  proper,  but  has  no  ade-</span></p> <p><span>  quate  provision  or  drainage  of  any</span><span>  kind.  The  removal  of  sewage</span><span>  is  attended  to  under  the  direction</span><span>  of  the  Board  of  health,  by  means  of</span><span>  night  carts,  and  the  earth  closet  system</span><span>  is  in  partial  operation.  These  arrange-</span><span>  ments  are  far  fron  satisfactory  ;  but  as</span><span>  regards  the  removal  of  storm  waters,  the</span><span>  situation  of  the  Valley  is  most  disadvan-</span><span>  tageous,  and  nothing  worthy  of  mention</span><span>  has  been  done  to  effect  an  improvement</span><span>  in  this  description  of  drainage.  A  con-</span><span>  siderable  portion  of  Fortitude  Valley  is</span><span>  so  low  as  to  be  subject  to  tidal  inunda-</span><span>  tion  from  the  river  ;  and  the  drainage  of</span><span>  the  northern  and  north-eastern  slopes  of</span><span>  the  city,  as  well  also  as  of  Bowen  and</span></p> <p><span>  Victoria  Park  and  surrounding  hills,</span><span>  finds  its  way  through  Fortitude</span></p> <p><span>  Valley  to  the  Bulimba  swamps,</span><span>  and  thence  into  the  river  some</span><span>  three  miles  below  the  city.  The</span><span>  ""Fortitude  Valley  Watershed""  embraces</span><span>  an  area  of  1210  acres,  and  a  rainfall</span><span>  over  the  whole  of  this  area  at</span><span>  the  rate  of  two  nches  per  hour,</span><span>  gives  a  total  quantity  of  nearly</span><span>  one  million  gallons  of  water  per  minute,</span><span>  and  to  carry  off  the  large  body  of  water</span><span>  that  must  fall  on  this  watershed  during</span><span>  tropical  storms  a  small  river  would  be</span><span>  necessary  to  prevent  the  extensive</span><span>  inundations  of  the  low-lying  lands  ;  but</span></p> <p><span>  no  such  watercourse  exists,  and  the</span><span>  main  channel  through  the  Valley  for  all</span><span>  this  drainage  is  not  more,  on  an  average,</span><span>  than  ten  feet  wide  and  four  feet  deep  ;</span><span>  it  has  the  further  disadvantage  of</span><span>  winding  its  way,  in  a  provoking  and</span><span>  capricious  manner,  through  densely</span><span>  populated  private  lands.  The  necessary</span><span>  result  is  that  a  heavy  ran  overflows  the</span><span>  banks  of  this  diminutive  watercourse,</span><span>  and  reduces  the  surrounding  lands  to  the</span><span>  condition  of  a  huge  swamp.  This  was</span><span>  in  the  early  days  of  settlement  a  very</span><span>  serious  inconvenience,  but  it  is  now  far</span><span>  worse,  as  the  swamp  lanes  are  thickly</span><span>  inhabited,  and  the  storm  waters</span><span>  are  grossly  contaminated  by  foecal</span></p> <p><span>  matter  and  other  pollutions  washed</span></p> <p><span>  down  from  accumulations  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  hill  sides  of  the  city  during</span><span>  a  long  period  of  drought.  Some  of  the</span><span>  residents  of  Fortitude  Valley,  aroused  by</span><span>  the  unwholesome  condition  of  the  locality</span><span>  of  their  habitations,  called  an  open-air</span><span>  meeting  for  the  afternoon  of  the  23rd</span><span>  ultimo,  but  at  the  time  appointed  for  the</span><span>  meeting  a  heavy  downpour  of  rain  pre-</span><span>  vented  a  large  gathering.  About  a</span><span>  hundred  persons  assembled,  however,</span><span>  in  a  neighbouring  building,  and  among</span><span>  their  number  was  Mr.  Dickson,  who</span><span>  guardedly  explained  that  he  had  come</span><span>  there,  not  as  a  Minister  of  the  Crown,</span><span>  but  as  member  for  part  of  the  district</span><span>  affected  by  this  question  of  drainage.  A</span><span>  meeting  of  a  conversational  character  took</span><span>  place,  and  a  deputation  was  appointed  to</span><span>  wait  upon  Mr.  Nisbet,  and  ascertain</span><span>  whether  temporary  relief  could  be</span><span>  afforded  by  a  moderate  expenditure  in</span><span>  clearing  the  watercourse.  It  subse-</span></p> <p><span>  quently  transpired  that  no  improvement</span><span>  worth  having  could  be  effected  without</span><span>  the  construction  of  a  large  drain,  as  in-</span><span>  dicated  in  Mr.  Nisbet's  report  on  this</span><span>  subject  tabled  in  Parliament  last  session.</span><span>  The  Valley,  meanwhile,  is  unfit  for  human</span><span>  habitation,  and  no  one  seems  to</span><span>  know  what  is  going  to  be  done.</span><span>  For  the  Metropolitan  municipal  autho-</span><span>  rities  to  find  the  money  for  this</span><span>  work  is  at  present  simply  impossible,  and</span><span>  the  drainage  district  is  principally  outside</span><span>  the  city  boundaries  ,  and  mostly  consists</span><span>  of  unalienated  Crown  lands,  including</span><span>  Victoria  and  Bowen  Parks.  The  con-</span><span>  clusion  seems  to  be  that  the  Government</span><span>  will  have  to  do  the  work,  or  render</span><span>  monetary  assistance  to  the  Council  ;  and</span></p> <p><span>  that  to  enable  the  Council  to  undertake</span><span>  the  work,  the  whole  drainage  district</span><span>  would  need  to  be  added  to  the  City</span><span>  Municipality.  We  notice  that  the  Courier</span><span>  argues  in  favour  of  the  general  system  of</span><span>  city  drainage,  which  is  already  in  Go-</span><span>  vernment  hands,  being  carried  to  com-</span><span>  pletion  by  the  Government  and  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  cost  of  the  Colonial  Revenue.  The</span><span>  reasons  advanced  for  this  course  are  :</span></p> <p><span>  (i)  that  the  area  included  in  the  Valley</span><span>  drainage  district  is  mostly  outside  the</span><span>  municipal  boundary  (2)  that  the  area</span><span>  to  be  drained  consists  principally  of</span><span>  unalienated  Crown  lands  ;  and  (3)  that</span><span>  the  alienated  portions  were  improperly</span><span>  sold  without  some  previous  provision</span><span>  having  been  secured  for  their  drainage.</span></p> <p><span>  It  must  be  admited  there  is  some</span><span>  cogency  in  these  reasons,  but  Parliament</span><span>  would  probably  hesitate  before  sanction-</span><span>  ing  an  appropriation  from  the  public</span><span>  revenue  for  such  a  purpose  as  city</span><span>  drainage,  unless  it  were  solicited  in  the</span><span>  form  of  a  loan  to  be  secured  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  properties  benefited  or  the  funds  were</span></p> <p><span>  derived  from  sale  of  Crown  lands</span><span>  within  the  district-  adopting  merely  an</span><span>  extension  of  the  provisions  of  the  Bris-</span></p> <p><span>  bane  Drainage  Act,  The  method  of</span></p> <p><span>  devoting  the  proceeds  of  land  sales  to</span><span>  drainage  purposes  is  perfectly  legitimate</span><span>  and  proper  ;  but  the  chances  are  that  its</span><span>  further  application,  on  a  scale  commen-</span><span>  surate  with  the  necessities  of  the  city,  is</span><span>  impracticable  in  Brisbane.  The  un-</span><span>  alienated  Crown  land  consist  chiefly,  as</span><span>  we  have  already  stated,  of  Victoria  and</span><span>  Bowen  Parks.  The  former  is  wanted  to</span></p> <p><span>  provide  ""  lungs""  for  the  city,  which  is</span><span>  rapidly  extending  on  the  northerly  side  ;</span><span>  and  the  latter  is  under  lease  to  the  Accli-</span><span>  matisation  Society,  and  in  part  devoted</span><span>  to  the  purposes  of  a  botanical  garden.</span><span>  It  is  argued  that  the  Government  should</span><span>  not  sell  lands  without  making  some  pro-</span><span>  vision  for  their  future  drainage,  and</span><span>  we  are  inclined  to  favour  this</span><span>  view.  It  may  further  be  contended</span><span>  that  the  land  fund  being  the  proper</span><span>  source  from  which  the  money  for  drain-</span><span>  age  work  should  be  obtained,  and  the</span><span>  proceeds  of  land  sales  in  Brisbane  and</span><span>  its  vicinity  having  been  thrown  into  the</span><span>  general  revenue,  without  any  reservation</span><span>  for  drainage  purposes,  the  proper  way  to</span><span>  make  amends  for  this  misappropriation</span><span>  would  be  to  provide  for  the  city  drainage</span><span>  by  a  special  vote  of  the  Legislature,</span><span>  authorising  the  defrayal  of  all  the  cost  of</span><span>  the  work  out  of  the  Consolidated  Re-</span><span>  venue  of  the  colony.  This,  of  course,</span><span>  would  only  apply  to  main  systems  of</span><span>  drains,  and  not  to  the  feeding  drains</span><span>  specially  benefiting  private  property.</span><span>  These  latter  are  fairly  chargeable  upon</span><span>  the  property  benefited,  as  is  being  adopted</span><span>  in  Brisbane,  where  private  drains  being</span><span>  constructed  by  the  Government,  are</span><span>  made  rateable  by  the  City  Corporation</span><span>  being  made  a  party  to  the  contract,  and</span><span>  practically  the  constructors  and  owners</span><span>  of  the  drains,  on  the  stipulation  that</span><span>  every  private  drain  so  constructed  shall  be</span><span>  paid  for  by  a  rate  levied  inder  the  provi-</span><span>  sions  of  the  Municipal  Act.  These  private</span><span>  drains  will  be  numerous  and  costly,  and</span><span>  will  probably  cast  upon  the  property</span><span>  owners  a  fair  share  of  the  total</span></p> <p><span>  expense  of  the  drainage  works  in  their</span><span>  locality.</span></p> <p><span>  Whilst,  however,  admitting  the  claim</span><span>  of  Brisbane  to  substantial  help  from  the</span><span>  public  Exchequer  in  the  prosecution  of</span><span>  drainage  works,  we  do  so  only  on  con-</span><span>  dition  that  the  metropolitan  city  shall</span><span>  be  treated  on  principles  applicable  to  all</span><span>  other  towns,  without  any  special  con-</span><span>  sideration  on  the  ground  of  its  being  the</span><span>  capital  of  the  colony.  But  the  acknow-</span><span>  ledgment  of  such  a  claim  on  such</span><span>  grounds  would  involve  a  very  heavy</span><span>  charge  upon  the  colonial  revenue,  and</span><span>  the  Legislative  Assembly  will  probably</span><span>  hesitate  to  make  a  precedent  fraught</span><span>  with  such  serious  consequences,  until</span><span>  the  breaking  out  of  a  dire  pestilence</span><span>  convinces  hon.  members  that  sanitary</span><span>  measures  cannot  safely  be  disregarded,</span><span>  and  that  even  railways  are  not  so</span><span>  important  as  the  health  af  the  com-</span><span>  munity.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Defended  causes  set  down  for  hearing</span><span>  in  the  small  debts  court  on  Wednesday  have</span><span>  been  adjourned  until  Wednesday  the  20th</span></p> <p><span>  instant,  is  consequence  of  the  Central  District</span><span>  Court  sittings.

The</span><span>  deceased  leaves  a  widow  and  two  children.</span><span>  He  has  been  a  resident  of  Rockhampton  for</span><span>  the  past  fifteen  years,  and  was  much  respected,</span><span>  having  been  known  as  an  industrious,  steady</span><span>  man.

A</span><span>  gentleman  who  owns  a  station  in  the  neigh-</span><span>  bourhood  of  Duaringa  stated  that  before  the</span><span>  bite  rain  thc  dry  weather  was  already  assum-</span><span>  ing  a  BCrious  aspect,  but  that  now  there  is</span><span>  abundance  both  of  grass  and  water  every-</span><span>  where.  A  very  severe  thunderstorm  visited</span><span>  the  Comet  last  Sunday  night.  The</span><span>  lightning  was  very  vivid,  and  the</span><span>  wind  was  so  great  os  to  unroof  tents  and</span><span>  throw  down  many  trees.  A  remarkable</span></p> <p><span>  escape  took  place  during  the  storm.  A  mau</span><span>  was  sitting  in  his  tent  reading,  and  while  so</span><span>  engaged  a  forked  branch  of  a  tree  fell  down  on</span><span>  his  bed.  On  Monday  an  accident  occurred  to</span><span>  a  man  named  Bcadman,  which  has  unfortu-</span><span>  nately  resulted  fatally.  He  was  driving  a</span><span>  horse  team  and  cart  laden  with  timber  from</span><span>  Cometville  to  Nogoa,  when  by  sonic  means  he</span><span>  fell  off  the  cart  and  the  wheel  passed  over  his</span><span>  arm,  producing  a  compound  fracture.  Thc</span><span>  horsoB,  when  released  from  control,  dashed</span><span>  off,  and  wore  afterwards  found  without  the</span><span>  dray  in  the  bush.  The  man  lay  for  eomo</span><span>  hours,  and  having  been  found  was  brought  in</span><span>  Smith's  mail  ccach  to  thc  Comet,  and  from</span><span>  there  to  the  Hospital.  The  sufferer  was</span><span>  accompanied  by  his  wife,  who,  believing  him</span><span>  to  be  in  a  fair  way  of  recovery,  returned  to</span><span>  Cometville  next  day,  On  Thursday,  however,</span><span>  she  received  a  telegram  that  lier  husband  was</span><span>  dead,  mortification  having  set  in.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  JULY  13,  1878..</span></p> <p><span>  THE  momentous  importance  of  the  step</span><span>  taken  by  Great  Britain  with  regard  to</span><span>  Asiatic  Turkey  and  Cyprus,  can  scarcely</span><span>  be  over-estimated,  and  it  seems  strange</span><span>  that  such  a  step  should  be  taken</span><span>  independently  of  the  Congress  which  is</span><span>  now  sitting  at  Berlin  to  endeavour  to</span><span>  arrive  at  a  peaceful  settlement  of  the</span><span>  Eastern  question.  But  it  is  well  to  bear</span><span>  in  mind  that  the  Congress  is  chiefly  con-</span><span>  cerned  in  European  Turkey,  and  except-</span><span>  ing  Russia  and  Great  Britain,  the</span><span>  principal  Powers  represented  there  have</span><span>  comparatively  little  interest  in  that  part</span><span>  of  the  Turkish  Empire  east  of  the  Bos-</span></p> <p><span>  phorus  and  the  Archipelago.  It  is  there-</span><span>  fore  not  improbable  that  Great  Britain,</span><span>  whilst  taking  an  equal  share  with  the</span><span>  other  Powers  in  the  deliberations</span><span>  of  the  Congress  as  regards  the</span><span>  disposal  of  Turkey  in  Europe,  feels  that</span><span>  to  cope  successfully  with  Russia  on  the</span><span>  Asiatic  side,  it  is  necessary  to  take  inde-</span><span>  pendent  and  prompt  action.  Russia</span><span>  holds  Batoum,  Kars,  and  Ardahan  ;  and</span><span>  although  she  has  yielded  to  the  demands</span><span>  of  the  Congress  in  reference  to  Batoum,</span></p> <p><span>  in  consenting  to  make  it  a  free  port,  the</span><span>  possession  of  this,  together  with  the  two</span><span>  other  strongholds  of  Armenia,  would</span><span>  give  her  an  ascendancy  in  Asia  cal-</span><span>  culated  to  prejudice  Great  Britain  com-</span><span>  mercially,  whilst  striking  a  blow  at</span><span>  British  prestige  with  such  effect  as  to</span><span>  necessitate  the  maintenance  of  a  naval</span><span>  station  in  the  Levant,  and  the  adoption</span><span>  of  other  precautionary  measures  as  a</span><span>  check  upon  Russian  influence  in  the</span><span>  East.  Prestige  does  much  to  enable</span><span>  Great  Britain  to  maintain  har  ascendancy</span><span>  over  the  millions  of  India  with  an  in-</span><span>  significant  European  military  force,  and</span><span>  that  prestige  must  be  maintained  at  all</span><span>  hazards  if  India  is  to  continue  a  desirable</span><span>  and  profitable  dependency  of  the  British</span><span>  Crown.  Reasons  such  as  these  appear</span><span>  to  have  had  weight  with  the  Beacons-</span><span>  field  Ministry,  who  have  concluded  a</span><span>  defensive  alliance  with  Turkey  which</span><span>  is  to  continue  until  Russia  restores</span><span>  to  that  Power  Batoum,  Kars,  and</span><span>  Ardahan.  The  withdrawal  of  the  British</span><span>  squadron,  under  Admiral  Hornby,  from</span><span>  the  Sea  of  Marmara,  has  hitherto  been</span><span>  made  conditional  upon  the  Russian</span><span>  troops  being  withdrawn  a  certain  dis-</span><span>  tance  from  Constantinople  ;  and  Earl</span><span>  Beaconsfield,  it  is  stated,  even  went  so</span><span>  far  as  to  make  the  participation  of  Great</span><span>  Britain  in  the  deliberations  of  the  Con-</span><span>  gress  contingent  upon  Russia's  with-</span><span>  drawal  from  the  environs  of  that  city.</span><span>  Whether  this  demand  was  unreservedly</span><span>  complied  with  or  not,  we  have  no</span><span>  definite  information.  Possibly  it  was</span><span>  not.  However,  it  is  now  stated  that  the</span><span>  squadron  will  remain  in  its  present</span><span>  position  whilst  Russia  retains  the  strong-</span><span>  holds  of  Armenia.  Taking  this</span><span>  announcement  in  conjunction  with  the</span><span>  mere  startling  one  that  a  treaty  has  been</span></p> <p><span>  icluded  with  Turkey  by  which  Great</span></p> <p><span>  Britain  assumes  a  protectorate  over  Asia</span><span>  Minor,  and  guarantees  the  integrity  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  Sultan's  Asiatic  realm-excepting  the</span></p> <p><span>  the  fortresses  at  present  in  Russian</span><span>  occupation,-and  that  Great  Britain  has</span><span>  actually  undertaken  the  military  occupa-</span><span>  tion  of  Cyprus  and  the  administra-</span><span>  tion  of  the  government  of  the</span><span>  island,  it  seems  plausible  that  all</span><span>  this  may  have  been  done  with  the</span><span>  connivance,  if  not  the  approval  of</span><span>  Germany,  Austria,  and  France  ;  and  this</span><span>  view  finds  support  in  the  circumstance</span><span>  that  the  conclusion  of  the  treaty  between</span><span>  Great  Britain  and  Turkey  had  been</span><span>  informally  mentioned  in  the  Congress  as</span><span>  if  it  were  a  matter  of  subordinate  interest</span><span>  in  the  settlement  of  the  long-standing</span><span>  and  perplexing  Eastern  question.  It  is</span><span>  well  known  thal  Prince  Bismarck,  at  the</span><span>  commencement  of  the  war,  urged  Great</span><span>  Britain  to  occupy  Egypt  and  assume  a</span><span>  protectorate  over  that  country  with  a  view</span><span>  to  ensure  the  free  passage  of  her</span><span>  highway  to  India  ;  and  we  may  therefore</span><span>  presume  that,  so  far  as  the  German</span><span>  Chancellor  is  the  exponent  of  German</span><span>  policy  on  this  question,  there  would  be</span><span>  no  very  serious  opposition  by  that  Power</span><span>  to  the  assumption  by  Great  Britain  of  a</span><span>  protectorate  over  Asia  Minor,  and  the</span><span>  virtual  annexation  of  Cyprus  to  the</span><span>  British  Crown.  With  Germany  satisfied,</span><span>  there  is  not  much  reason  to  fear  any</span><span>  active  opposition  from  Austria,  or  even</span><span>  from  France,  with  whom  Great  Britain</span><span>  appears  to  have  maintained,  throughout</span><span>  the  present  crisis,  the  most  cordial  re-</span></p> <p><span>  lations.</span></p> <p><span>  A  British  protectorate  in  Asia  Minor</span><span>  is  a  responsibility  the  full  extent  of  which</span><span>  cannot  easily,  on  first  consideration,  be</span><span>  fully  appreciated  and  understood.  Before</span><span>  the  assembling  of  the  Congress,  such  a</span><span>  step  would  have  been  regarded  as  tanta-</span><span>  mount  to  a  declaration  of  war  with  Rus-</span><span>  sia;  and  when  we  call  to  mind  the</span><span>  arrogant  tone  lately  assumed  by  Russia,</span><span>  we  may  with  some  reason  ask,  will  she</span><span>  now  tamely  submit  to  be  dictated  to  by</span></p> <p><span>  a  Power  that  has  taken  no  active</span><span>  part  in  the  late  bloody  and  ex-</span><span>  pensive  war,  and  yet  steps  in  at  the</span><span>  settlement,  and  refuses  to  the  victor  the</span><span>  means  of  indemnification  which  seemed</span><span>  to  be  already  assured  ?  For  Russia  to</span><span>  tamely  acquiesce  in  the  course  taken  by</span><span>  Great  Britain  would  be  extremely  humi-</span><span>  liating  to  that  Power;  but  from  what</span><span>  has  taken  place,  in  the  Congress,  we  are</span><span>  induced  to  believe  that  Russian  diplo-</span><span>  macy  has  been  completely  over-awed  by</span><span>  the  attitude  of  the  British  Government,</span><span>  and  that  the  Czar  will  accept  the  terms</span><span>  imposed  upon  him  rather  than  enter  upon</span><span>  a  renewal  of  hostilities  which  might</span></p> <p><span>  involve  his  Empire  in  financial  ruin,  and</span></p> <p><span>  imperil  even  the  dynasty  itself.</span></p> <p><span>  We  should  suppose  that  what  Jittle</span><span>  might  be  left  of  the  Treaty  of  San</span></p> <p><span>  Stefano  after  the  Congress  has  done  with  ¡</span></p> <p><span>  it  will  be  of  little  value  to  Russia  in  the</span><span>  face  of  the  more  recent  treaty  which</span><span>  Turkey  has  entered  into  with  Great</span><span>  .Britain.  The  latter,  it  must  be  under-</span><span>  stood,  not  only  imposes  a  check  upon</span><span>  Russian  aggrandisement  in  Asia,  but</span><span>  places  Great  Britain  in  command  of  the</span><span>  Eastern  shores  of  the  Dardanelles,  the</span></p> <p><span>  Bosphorus,  and  the  Black  Sea,  and  gives  ?</span><span>  her  an  advantage  which,  in  the  event  of</span></p> <p><span>  hostilities  with  Russia,  would  place  Great  j</span><span>  Britain  in  a  far  better  position  than  a  few  i</span><span>  weeks  ago  she  could  have  hoped  to  oc-</span><span>  cupy  without  incurring  a  lavish  expendí</span><span>  ture  of  blood  and  treasure.  And  it  is</span><span>  not  only  on  the  Anatolian  Peninsula  that</span><span>  English  influence  is  now  paramount,  but</span></p> <p><span>  also  in  the  islands  of  the  Levant.  A  j</span><span>  suggestion  was  thrown  out  by  Sir  Henry</span><span>  Havelock,  shortly  before  the  recent  in</span></p> <p><span>  vasion  of  Turkey  by_  the  Russian  Armies,  Í</span><span>  that  Great  Britain  might  effectually  check-</span><span>  mate  Russia,1  even  in  the  event  of  her  ob-</span><span>  taining  possession  of  Constantinople,  by</span><span>  the  simple  expedient  of  purchasing  from</span><span>  Turkey  the  island  of  Mitylene,  and  con-</span><span>  verting  it  into  a  second  Malta,  as  by  this</span><span>  course  she  would  effectually  command</span><span>  the  entrance  of  the  Dardanelles  and</span><span>  secure  the  passage  of  the  Suez  Canal.</span><span>  Mitylene  possesses  two  goodharbours,  and</span><span>  is  well  adapted  for  a  naval  station.</span><span>  The  protectorate  over  Asia  Minor</span><span>  embraces  this,  with  all  the  islands</span><span>  in  the  Levant  ;  and  Cyprus,  the  principal</span><span>  island  in  those  waters,  is  virtually  to  be-</span><span>  come  a  British  dependency.  Our  tele-</span><span>  grams  state  that  it  will  continue  a  part  of</span><span>  Turkey,  and  any  surplus  revenue  over  the</span><span>  expenses  of  governing  the  island  will  be</span><span>  payable  to  the  Sultan;  but  .the  suzer-</span><span>  ainty  under  the  conditions  agreed  upon</span><span>  will  be  merely  nominal.  Great  Britain</span><span>  never  seeks  to  extort  a  revenue  by</span><span>  means  of  taxation  from  her  dependen-</span><span>  cies  for  the  enrichment  of  the  home  ex-</span><span>  chequer,  and  in  administering  the  govern-</span><span>  ment  it  is  considered  sufficient  to  render</span><span>  a  dependency  self-supporting,  so  that  no</span><span>  additional  burden  may  fall  upon  the</span><span>  British  taxpayer.  The  provision  for</span><span>  handing  over  any  surplus  to  the  Sultan</span><span>  is  therefore  rather  calculated  to  expite  a</span><span>  smile,  as  the  chance  of  a  surplus  arising</span><span>  is  almost  out  of  the  question.  It  is  far</span><span>  more  likely  that  a  considerable  sum  will</span><span>  have  to  be  voted  annually  to  defray  the</span><span>  expenses  of  the  government  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  island.</span></p> <p><span>  Cyprus  possesses  great  natural  re-</span><span>  sources  both  in  fertility  of  soil  and  unde-</span><span>  veloped  mineral  wealth.  The  island  is</span><span>  reputed  to  have  once  contained  a  million</span><span>  inhabitants,  but,  under  Turkish  misrule,</span><span>  it  has  continuously  declined  and  dwindled</span><span>  down  to  about  100,000-certainly,  it  does</span><span>  not,  at  the  present  time,  very  much  ex-</span><span>  ceed  that  number.  But,  under  British</span><span>  Government,  the  peculation  and  venality</span><span>  of  Turkish  officials  will  be  brought  under</span><span>  restraint,  and  trade  and  commerce</span><span>  may  be  expected  to  revive  and  re-</span><span>  cover  much  of  its  ancient  importance.</span><span>  Great  Britain  will  not  have  complete</span><span>  control  in  the  national  affairs  of  Asia</span><span>  Minor,  but  she  will  be  abie  to  insist</span><span>  upon  and  enforce  reforms  even  there,</span><span>  and  obtain  an  amelioration  of  the  con-</span><span>  dition  of  the  people.  The  natural</span><span>  capabilities  of  the  Asian  Peninsula  are</span><span>  great,  only  awaiting  a  favourable  oppor-</span><span>  tunity  for  their  development,  and  that</span><span>  opportunity  would  now  appear  to  be  at</span></p> <p><span>  hand.</span></p> <p><span>  Tm:  Rev.

Mr.  Bolton  has  a  very  fair  concep-</span><span>  tion  of  thc  Danish  Prince,  and  considering  the</span><span>  difficulty  of  the  character  he  may  be  compli-</span><span>  mented  on  his  performance.  Miss  Stephen-</span><span>  son,  as  Opludia,  was  at  home  in  her</span><span>  part,  as  she  always  is,  and  obtained  the  hearty</span><span>  applause  of  the  audience.  Mr.  Carey,  as</span><span>  Pobmiu«,  was  decidedly  good,  and  Miss</span><span>  Wallace  performed  the  Queen  with  grace  and</span><span>  dignity.  Tho  tone  of  Mr.  Seagrave's  voice,</span><span>  as  thc  Ghost,  was  certainly  cavernous  enough,</span><span>  and  this  gentleman  performed  the  part  well.</span><span>  Mr.  Thorp  and  Mr.  Vincent  also  creditably</span><span>  played  their  parts,  and  the  minor  characters</span><span>  were  very  fairly  rendered.  The  effect  of  the</span><span>  piece  was  much  heightened  by  the  appropriate</span><span>  dresses  ;  no  expense  seems  to  hare  been  spared</span><span>  in  tliiB  particular.  Altogether,  the  play  was</span><span>  produced  very  creditably,  and  gave  the  audi-</span><span>  tors  a  very  fair  idea  of  Shakespeare's  great</span><span>  tragedy.</span></p> <p><span>  YEsrEBjJAV  afternoon,  at  four  o'clock  the</span><span>  monthly  meeting  of  the  Committee  of  the  Port</span><span>  Curtis  and  Leichhardt  District  Hospital  was</span><span>  held  in  the  Court-house.

In  the  absence  of  the</span><span>  President  (Captain  Hunter)  Mr.  W.  Pattison</span><span>  was  voted  to  the  chair.  The  minutes  of  the</span><span>  previous  monthly  and  special  meeting  were</span><span>  read  and  confirmed.  A  question  having  been</span><span>  asked  by  Mr.  Schmidt  as  to  whether  the</span><span>  Committee  would  be  bound  to  accept  the</span><span>  Government  plans  for  the  contemplated</span><span>  addition,  the  Chairman  replied  that  he  did</span><span>  not  think  they  would.  He  might  state  that</span><span>  In  accordance  with  the  resolution  of  the</span><span>  special  meeting  Captain  Hunter  hod  written  a</span><span>  .letter,  which  ha  (Mr.  Pattison)  had  seen,</span><span>  to  tho  Colonial  Secretary,  calling  bis</span><span>  attention  to  thc  fact  that  the  plans  for  the</span><span>  addition  were  not  in  accordance  with  the</span></p> <p><span>  wishes  of  the  Committee,  and  stating  that  if</span><span>  thc  Government  did  not  think  they  would  be</span><span>  able  to  carry  out  the  work  for  the  money,  to</span><span>  givo  the  Committee  the  £2500  and  they  would</span><span>  do  it.  Tho  accounts  for  the  month,  which</span><span>  amounted  to  £300  18s.  7d.,  were  then  con-</span><span>  sidered.  The  expenses  for  the  month  were</span><span>  larger  than  usual,  owing  to  an  item  of  £31</span><span>  16s.  7d.  for  quilts,  and  another  of  £27  18s.  4d.</span><span>  for  medical  comforts.  On  the  motion  of  Mr.</span><span>  Schmidt,  seconded  hy  Mr.  Brown,  the  accounts</span><span>  were  passed  and  ordered  to  bo  poid.  The</span><span>  Treasureracknowledgedreceiptof  £3114a.  lld.</span><span>  from  poor  boxes,  and  of  £115  17s.  lld.  from</span><span>  unclaimed  poundages.  He  would  call  the</span></p> <p><span>  attention  of  the  Committee  to  the  fact</span><span>  that  the  votes  from  the  Government  was</span><span>  greatly  over  due.  Lists  had  boen  sent  in</span><span>  which  would  entitle  them  to  receive  £900,  and</span><span>  £400,  at  least,  was  in  arrear  Bince  November</span><span>  last.  This  was  on  the  accounts  up  to  the  end</span><span>  of  lost  year,  but  up  to  the  end  of  June  a  much</span><span>  greater  sum  would  be  due.  After  some  con-</span><span>  versation,  it  was  decided  that  Mr.  Macfarlane</span><span>  receive  particulars  from  the  Treasurer  and  in-</span><span>  quire,  on  his  return  to  Brisbane,  the  reason  of</span><span>  the  delay.  Mr.  Hill  inquired  if  it  waa  not</span><span>  usual  for  the  Visiting  Committee  to  give  in  a</span><span>  report.  Mr.  Schmidt  explained  that,  as  one</span><span>  of  that  Committee,  he  had  visited  the  Hos-</span><span>  pital,  and  as  everything  was  going  on  satis-</span><span>  factorily,  he  had  nothing  to  report  upon.  Mr.</span><span>  Brown,  another  member,  would  be  very</span><span>  liappy  to  bring  forward  a  report  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  future.  The  Chairman  said  the  next  business</span><span>  was  the  consideration  of  the  motion  given</span><span>  notice  of  at  last  meeting,  relative  to  the  salary</span><span>  of  thc  Resident  Surgeon.  Dr.  Campbell</span><span>  having  retired,  Mr.  Hall  mored  that  the  salary</span><span>  of  the  Resident  Surgeon  be  £500  per  annum,</span></p> <p><span>  to  take  effect  from  the  1st  instant.  The</span></p> <p><span>  patienta  had  greatly  increased,  the  duties  of</span><span>  the  Surgeon  had  correspondingly  increased  ;</span><span>  and,  as  the  institution  was  so  well  managed,</span><span>  he  thought  thc  Surgeon  merited  the  increase</span><span>  proposed.  The  motion  was  seconded  by  Mr.</span><span>  Macfarlane.  Mr.  Faunce  inquired  if  he  was</span><span>  to  uuderstaud  that  was  to  include  the  £50</span><span>  allowed  for  dispensing.  On  the  Chairman  re-</span><span>  ferring  to  the  minute  book,  aud  finding  that</span><span>  the  £50  was  specially  provided  for  in  addition</span><span>  to  the  Balary  of  £400  a  year,  Mr.  Hall  so</span><span>  amended  his  motion  as  to  raise  thc  salary  of</span><span>  the  Resident  Surgeon  to  £500  a  year,  exclusive</span><span>  of  allowance  for  dispensing.  The  amended</span><span>  motion  was  seconded  by  Mr.  Macfarlane,  and</span><span>  passed  unanimously.  The  Committee  then</span><span>  adjourned.</span></p> <p><span>  DASTAKDLV  CONDUCT  OF  A  Snip's  CREW.</span><span>  The  steamship  Childwall  Hall,  of  Liverpool,</span><span>  on  the  I2th  April,  was  stranded  at  Sagres,</span><span>  near  Cape  St.  Vincent.  The  captain's  conduct</span><span>  and  that  of  thc  officers  was  a  redeeming</span><span>  contrast  to  that  of  the  cowardly  and</span><span>  treacherous  crew,  who  went  oír  in  the  best</span><span>  lifclioat,  leaving  ladies  and  children  to  their</span><span>  fate.  This  conduct  is  so  utterly  un-English</span><span>  (says  a  contemporary)  that  we  trust  sonic</span><span>  means  may  be  lound  of  making  the  hacks  of</span><span>  thc  deserters,  if  they  survived,  acquainted  with</span><span>  thc  taste  of  thc  cat.  The  doctor  of  the  ship</span><span>  died  a  true  martyr.  Finding  that  he  was  one</span><span>  too  many  in  thc  boat  which  contained  ladies,</span><span>  he  voluntarily  gave  up  his  final  chance  of</span><span>  safety.  When  last  seen  on  thc  doomed  ship</span><span>  he  was  looking  sad,  as  well  he  might,  for  it  is</span><span>  certain  such  a  man  knew  iii  at  his  death  would</span><span>  carry  sorrow  to  many  hearts.  The  presence</span><span>  of  mind  and  persevering  courage  displayed  by</span><span>  the  ladies  whosurvived  the  repeated  capsizings</span><span>  of  their  boat  was  remarkable.  Cue  rescued</span><span>  lier  husband  from  drowning,  and  be  it  noted</span><span>  that  Mrs.  ^'Estranges  owed  the  preservation</span><span>  of  her  life  to  bei'  knowledge  of  swimming.</span><span>  Thc  tale  is  a  very  Bad  one,  ord  in  some  respects</span><span>  reflects  disgrace  on  the  name  of  British  sailor,</span><span>  if  the  deserters  were  really  DritonB.  On  the</span><span>  other,  the  conduct  of  the  ladies,  the  unfortu-</span><span>  nate  captain,  and  especially  the  self-sacrificing</span><span>  doctor,  leaves  us  room  to  think  well  of  human</span></p> <p><span>  nature,  and  to  be  proud  of  our  countrymen</span><span>  and  countrywomen.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  SEPTEMBER  7,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  OUR  metropolitan  contemporary  the</span><span>  Courier  invites  attention  to  the  fact  that</span><span>  the  authorised  expenditure  for  the</span><span>  current  year  will  be  some  ,£80,000  in</span><span>  excess  of  the  anticipated  revenue.  The</span><span>  blame  is  laid  primarily  on  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  but  the  writer  insists  that  the</span><span>  unofficial  members  cannot  be  relieved</span><span>  of  their  share  of  the  responsibility,</span><span>  seeing  that  they  had  the  power  to  refuse</span></p> <p><span>  to  vote  the  total  amount  asked  for.</span><span>  With  this  doctrine  we  cannot  refuse  to</span><span>  concur,  for  it  is  unconstitutional  on  the</span><span>  part  of  the  people's  representatives  to</span><span>  authorise  expenditure  in  excess  of</span><span>  estimated  ways  and  means.  Still  we</span><span>  contend  that  the  members  of  the  Op-</span><span>  position  can  hardly  be  held  responsible</span><span>  for  the  fiasco,  for  such  it  is.  The  whole</span><span>  secret  of  the  mischief  is  the  retention  in</span><span>  power  of  a  Ministry  who  do  not  enjoy</span><span>  the  confidence  of  the  House.  To</span><span>  effectually  resist  log-rolling  combina-</span><span>  tions,  it  is  essential  that  such  confidence</span><span>  should  be  held  and  retained  by  the</span><span>  Ministry  of  the  day.  For  some  time</span><span>  past  Mr.  Douglas  and  his  colleagues</span></p> <p><span>  have  not  been  able  to  command  a  work-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  majority  on  any  important  question.</span><span>  When  the  question  was  put  a  few  weeks</span></p> <p><span>  ago  as  to  whether  the  Government</span><span>  should  be  turned  out  or  not,  an  actual</span><span>  majority  could  not  be  induced  to  vote  in</span><span>  the  affirmative.  Owing  to  the  absence</span><span>  of  a  well-known  Opposition  member  it</span><span>  was  determined  by  a  majority  of  one  not</span><span>  to  then  administer  the  coup  de  grace.</span><span>  But  of  the  majority  more  than  one  was</span><span>  known  to  lack  confidence  in  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  ;  indeed,  one  honorable  member,</span><span>  who  made  no  secret  of  his  distrust,</span><span>  avowedly  gave  them  his  final  vote</span><span>  because  he  chivalrously  refused,  in  the</span><span>  expiring  days  of  the  session,  to  desert</span><span>  the  ship  in  which  he  had  so  long  sailed.</span><span>  Several  other  members  of  ihe  majority</span><span>  might  also  be  named  as  among  those</span><span>  whose  votes  Ministers  could  not  rely  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  upon  to  carry  out  their  policy.  The</span><span>  Opposition,  on  the  other  hand,  if  in  a</span><span>  very  slight  minority,  were  a  compact</span><span>  body  loyal  to  their  leader  on  all  important</span><span>  matters,  and  only  desirous  of  having</span><span>  their  fling  occasionally  on  matters</span><span>  possessing  no  party  significance.  As,</span><span>  therefore,  the  fundamental  principle  of  re-</span><span>  sponsible  government  is  that  the  majority</span></p> <p><span>  shall  rule,  and  that  through  Ministers  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  in  whom  confidence  is  reposed,  the</span><span>  wonder  is,  not  that  the  finances  of  the</span><span>  country  have  been  thrown  into  pro-</span><span>  spective  disorder,  but  that  the  confusion</span></p> <p><span>  has  not  been  made  worse  than  it  threat-</span><span>  ens  to  be.  It  is  an  anomalous  condition</span><span>  of  affairs  when  the  Ministry  of  the  day</span><span>  have  to  consult  the  feelings  of  opponents</span><span>  rather  than  supporters,  and  when  they</span><span>  turn  their  sails  to  meet  tempestuous  gales</span><span>  ahead,  instead  of  gliding  calmly,  if  not</span><span>  swiftly,  along  under  pressure  of favourable</span></p> <p><span>  breezes.</span></p> <p><span>  The  threatened  financial  disorder  arises</span><span>  thus.  The  Treasurer  originally  proposed</span><span>  to  spend  nearly  all  the  money  he  esti-</span><span>  mated  to  receive,  without  leaving  the</span><span>  customary  and  necessary  margin  for  sup-</span><span>  plementary  expenditure.  That  margin</span><span>  it  has  been  customary  to  leave  at  from</span><span>  £60,000  to  £70,000  ;  but  this  year  the</span><span>  Treasurer  cut  it  down  to  £24,000.  At</span><span>  any  rate,  that  amount  excepted,  he  ap-</span><span>  propriated  all  his  anticipated  increase  of</span><span>  revenue  for  the  year,  amounting  to</span><span>  £132,000.  What  the  demand  upon  the</span><span>  £24,000  will  be,  will  be  understood  when</span><span>  we  say  that  last  year's  Supplementary</span><span>  Estimates  exceeded  £150,000.  They</span><span>  cannot  be  less  this  year,  because  the</span><span>  Assembly  has  already  supplemented  the</span><span>  Estimates-in-Chief  by  some  £30,000</span><span>  voted  on  motions  by  private  members.</span><span>  It  must  be  remembered  also  that  there</span><span>  will  be  additional  expenditure  to  the</span><span>  amount  of  some  ,£80,000  on  account</span><span>  of  last  year's  unexpended  votes  carried</span><span>  forward.  The  conclusion  therefore  is</span><span>  that,  to  avoid  a  deficit,  the  Treasurer</span><span>  must  not  only  spend  £80,000  less  than</span><span>  is  at  present  contemplated,  but  also</span><span>  withhold  the  expenditure  of  another</span><span>  £80,000  of  authorised  votes  to  compen-</span><span>  sate  for  unforeseen  or  supplementary</span><span>  disbursements.  In  other  words,  while</span><span>  on  30th  June  last  there  was  £80,000</span><span>  of  authorised  grants  unexpended,  fully</span><span>  double  that  amount  must  remain  un-</span><span>  spent  on  30th  June  next  to  avert  the</span><span>  threatened  deficit.  And  as  the  greater</span><span>  portion  of  these  ""  savings  ""  must  be  in</span><span>  road  votes,  it  is  easily  understood  that</span><span>  the  proposed  increase  of  £60,000</span><span>  in  such  expenditure  must  be  authorised</span><span>  in  defiance  of  the  limits  of  revenue,</span><span>  or  with  the  intent  to  delude  the</span><span>  constituencies  before  the  General  Election.</span><span>  Whichever  be  accepted  as  the  real</span><span>  motive,  both  are  equally  indefensible.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Government  have  no  constitutional</span><span>  right  to  ask  for  supply  in  excess  of</span><span>  anticipated  revenue,  and  if  the  estimated</span><span>  receipts  were  less  than  the  amount  de-</span><span>  manded  for  the  proper  conduct  of  the</span><span>  public  service,  it  was  their  clear  duty  to</span><span>  ask  authority  to  impose  fresh  taxation.</span><span>  That  is  what  Mr.  Bocaut  has  done  in</span></p> <p><span>  South  Australia,  and  that  is  what  any</span></p> <p><span>  Treasurer  who  was  alive  to  a  full  sense</span><span>  of  his  responsibilities  would  have  found</span><span>  it  necessary  to  do  in  the  present  circum-</span><span>  stances  of  this  colony.  We  mean,  of</span><span>  course,  taking  the  Government  view</span><span>  that  ""  the  Estimates  have  been  formed</span><span>  with  due  regard  to  efficiency  and</span><span>  economy.""  After  the  two  or  three</span><span>  favourable  seasons  the  colony  has  ex-</span><span>  perienced  from  a  road  maintenance  point</span><span>  of  view,  it  is  nonsense  to  assert  the</span><span>  necessity  of  spending  ,£60,000  more</span><span>  upon  roads  and  buildings  this  year  than</span><span>  was  deemed  sufficient  last  year.  Why</span><span>  the  roads  outlay  should  be  suddenly</span><span>  increased  by  over  fifty  per  cent  it  is</span><span>  impossible  to  understand  on  any  other</span><span>  hypothesis  than  that  honorable  members</span><span>  on  both  sides  want  to  go  to</span><span>  their  constituents  with  a  solatium.</span><span>  This  was  provided  for  Minis-</span><span>  terial  supporters  on  the  Estimates</span><span>  in-Chief,  and  for  Opposition  members  on</span><span>  the  Supplementaries.  The  Government</span><span>  are  therefore  censurable  on  two  grounds</span><span>  —for  recommending  excessive  appro-</span><span>  priations  at  first,  and  then  accepting</span><span>  additional  votes  at  the  beck  of  private</span><span>  members.  Mr.  Dickson  may  declare</span><span>  that  he  did  not  accept,  and  that  the  sup-</span><span>  plementary  votes  were  passed  in  spite  of</span><span>  his  protests.  But  he  is  a  responsible</span><span>  Minister  placed  in  charge  of  the  public</span><span>  Treasury,  and  he  is  bound  either  to</span><span>  defend  it  from  assault  or  give  up  his</span></p> <p><span>  seals  of  office  to  a  more  resolute  man.</span></p> <p><span>  Ministers  had  the  power  to  defeat  these</span><span>  private  members'  motions  had  they</span><span>  chosen  to  do  so,  for  if  not  able  to  carry</span><span>  their  point  from  the  Treasury  benches</span><span>  their  duly  was  to  attack  it  from  the</span><span>  other  side.  By  which  we  mean  that</span><span>  they  should  have  applied  the  party  whip,</span><span>  which  failing  they  should  have  appealed</span><span>  to  the  constituencies,  and,  if  beaten  in</span><span>  the  new  House,  have  cast  upon  other</span><span>  men  the  responsibility  for  introducing</span><span>  financial  chaos.  Todd  says,  ""None  can</span><span>  effectually  challenge  the  proposed  expen-</span><span>  diture  [of  Ministers]  to  any  material</span><span>  extent,""  and  the  same  authority  quotes</span><span>  Mr.  Gladstone  as  affirming  that  ""  no</span><span>  Government  could  be  worthy  of  its  place</span><span>  if  it  permitted  its  estimates  to  be  seriously</span><span>  resisted  by  the  Opposition  ;  and  impor-</span><span>  tant  changes  can  only  be  made  therein</span><span>  under  circumstances  which  permit  of  the</span><span>  raising  of  the  question  of  a  change  of</span><span>  Government.""  Mr.  M'llwraith  and  his</span><span>  followers  have  challenged  the  Ministerial</span><span>  Estimates  to  the  serious  extent  of  author-</span></p> <p><span>  ising  £30,000  additional  of  road  votes</span></p> <p><span>  beyond  the  amount  deemed  necessary  by</span><span>  the  Government,  and  this  in  the  face  of</span><span>  the  Treasurer's  protest  that  he  would  not</span><span>  have  the  money  to  spend.  The  action</span><span>  of  the  majority  is  equivalent  to  saying  to</span><span>  the  Government,.  ""  We  do  not  care</span><span>  whether  your  own  proposals,  as  per</span><span>  Estimates-in-Chief,  are  acceded  to  or  not  ;</span><span>  but  we  insist  that  you  find  money  for  the</span><span>  additional  works  designated  in  private</span><span>  members'  motions.  ""  This  is virtually</span><span>  ordering  Ministers  to  make  bricks  without</span><span>  straw.  The  fíat  is  humbly  submitted  to,</span><span>  and  the  Government  lowers  itself  by</span><span>  accepting  the  responsibility  of  perform-</span><span>  ing  the  impossible.  As  a  matter  of  fact</span><span>  they  do  not  intend  to  make  the  bricks,</span><span>  but  in  common  honesty  they  should</span><span>  refuse  to  undertake  an  impracticable</span><span>  task,  even  for  the  sake  of  retaining</span><span>  £1ooo  a-year.</span></p> <p><span>  Now  thal  the  Local  Government  Bill</span><span>  has  become  law,  we  cannot  admit  the</span><span>  necessity  of  an  increase  of  ,  £60,000 in</span><span>  the  road  expenditure  of  the  year,  and</span><span>  Ministers  might  well  have  reduced  their</span><span>  original  estimates  when  the  measure  for</span><span>  decentralising  the  Roads Department</span><span>  had  been  passed.  What  is  the  use  of</span><span>  the  Act  if  simultaneously  with  its  passing</span><span>  the  roads  expenditure  of  the  Central</span><span>  Government  is  to  be  increased  by  fifty</span><span>  per  cent,  it  is  difficult  to  conjecture.</span><span>  And  as  the  statute  gives  local  bodies</span><span>  claims  lo  liberal  endowment,  the  Trea-</span><span>  surer  may  expect  to  find  his  deficit</span><span>  further  increased  by  payments  on  that</span></p> <p><span>  account.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  no  greater  danger  to  a</span><span>  community  than  a  weak  Government.</span><span>  An  honest  Ministry  would  not  remain  in</span><span>  charge  of  public  affairs  which  they  were</span><span>  unable  to  control  ;  and  men  who  will</span><span>  submit  to  the  humiliation  of  retaining</span><span>  die  responsibilities  of  government  after</span><span>  their  policy  has  been  reversed  by  the</span><span>  Legislature,  must  be  destitute  of  that</span></p> <p><span>  moral  sensitiveness  in  the  absence  of</span><span>  which  it  is  hopeless  to  expect  purity  of</span><span>  administration.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Rev.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  SEPTEMBER  10,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  absolute  necessity  of  northern  and</span><span>  country  members  keeping  a  strict  watch</span><span>  upon  the  Government,  is  shown  by  the</span><span>  frauds  sought  to  be  perpetrated  upon  the</span><span>  country  in  the  Supplementary  Esti-</span><span>  mates  put  before  the  Assembly</span><span>  last  week.  A  fortnight  since  the</span><span>  leaders  of  parties  came  to  an  amicable</span><span>  arrangement  to  introduce  no  new  business</span><span>  of  an  important  character,  and  to  push</span><span>  through  the  remaining  estimates  with  all</span><span>  possible  rapidity.  The  country  members</span><span>  on  both  sides  were  then,  if  we  are</span><span>  correctly  informed,  set  at  liberty  for  the</span><span>  session,  and  under  that  arrangement  no</span><span>  less  than  seven  members  of  the  Opposi-</span><span>  tion,  besides  two  or  three  Ministerialists,</span><span>  went  to  their  homes,  or  to  visit  their</span><span>  properlies  ;in  the  far  West.  After  this,</span><span>  one  of  the  first  things  that  happened  was</span><span>  the  sending  down  of  Supplementary</span><span>  Estimates  for  last  year  to  the  amount  of</span><span>  ;£  106,000,  and  including  several  items</span><span>  of  an  improper  character.  One  of  these</span><span>  was  thc  salary  of  a  road  ranger  which  the</span><span>  House  had  refused  to  vote  last  year,  and</span><span>  another  thc  sum  of  ^2450  for  Brisbane</span><span>  water  rates.  Thc  Supplementary  Esti-</span><span>  mate  was  allowed  to  lie  on  the  table</span></p> <p><span>  until  Wednesday  last,  then  believed  to</span><span>  be  thc  last  day  of  the  session.  'Die</span><span>  attendance  was  small,  and  but  for  the</span><span>  watchfulness  of  the  older  politicians  the</span><span>  objectionable  items  would  have  passed</span></p> <p><span>  unnoticed.  But  this  was  not  the  worst</span><span>  feattire  of  the  proceeding.  Ou  Wed-</span><span>  nesday  thc  House  was  surprised  at</span><span>  receiving  two  other  batches  of  estimates,</span><span>  one  on  revenue  account,  the  other  on</span><span>  loan  ;  thc  first  amounting  to  /,""66,ooo,</span><span>  tile  second  to  ^67,000.  Roth  these</span><span>  were  also  disfigured  by  improper  items.</span><span>  Among  these  were  Ihc  £20,000  proposed</span><span>  to  bc  lent  to  the  Brisbane  Grammar</span><span>  School,  another  vole  of  JQ\0,000  for  thc</span><span>  Brisbane  Waterworks,  another  ;£iooo</span></p> <p><span>  for  water  rates  for  the  same  body,  and  !</span><span>  ,£2000  for  Wide  Hay  roads,  which  the</span><span>  House  had  negatived  on  division  a  few</span><span>  weeks  ago.</span></p> <p><span>  Rockhampton  readers  may  say,  ""Well,</span><span>  we  don't  care,  so  long  as  we  get  what  xv</span><span>  want.""  That  might  be  allowed  to  pass,</span></p> <p><span>  were  the  financial  resources  of  the  colony  '</span><span>  illimitable.  But  they  are  not  so,  and  I</span></p> <p><span>  there  is  too  much  reason  to  fear  that  the</span><span>  time  is  at  hand  when  the  draff  must  be</span><span>  put  on.  There  is  only  a  certain  amount</span><span>  available  for  expenditure,  and  if  an  undue</span><span>  proportion  is  laid  outon  themetropolis  the</span><span>  provincial  districlscannolpossiblygct  their</span><span>  share.  When  the  money  runs  out,  it  will</span><span>  be  too  late  to  demand  a  full  share,  and</span><span>  therefore,  from  a  merely  local  point  of</span><span>  view,  it  is  not  only  wise  lo  insist  upon  a</span><span>  fair  division  as  the  expenditure  goes  on,</span><span>  but  also  necessary  to  see  that  no  unfair</span><span>  advantage  is  obtained  by  persons  and</span><span>  boards  which  dog  the  Ministerial  foot-</span><span>  steps,  and  are  ever  ready  with  a  sinister</span><span>  suggestion  to  secure  a  mean  advantage</span><span>  over  communities  less  favourably  situated.</span></p> <p><span>  Touching  the  amount  of  .£20,000  for</span><span>  the  Brisbane  Grammar  School.  The</span><span>  trustees  of  this  institution  two  years  since</span><span>  tried  to  swindle  the  country  by  demand-</span><span>  ing  ,£16,000  from  the  Government  as  the</span><span>  price  of  their  old  site  and  premises.  The</span><span>  site  itself,  or  a  portion  of  it,  was  origi-</span><span>  nally  a  grant  from  the  Government,  but</span><span>  the  greater  part  of  the  land  was</span><span>  obtained  surreptitiously.  First  placed</span><span>  under  the  temporary  control  of  the</span><span>  Grammar  School  trustees,  it  was</span><span>  eventually  made  over  to  them  by  deed</span><span>  of  grant.  On  whose  authority  no  one</span><span>  ever  seemed  to  know,  but  it  is  well</span><span>  known  that  the  grant  was  issued  either</span><span>  fraudulently  or  in  error.  The  transac-</span><span>  tion  being  exposed  in  the  Assembly  thc</span><span>  vote  was  thrown  out  in  1876,  but  in  1877</span><span>  it  re-appeared  for  a  reduced  amount,  or</span><span>  ¿13,000.  This  the  Assembly  reluctantly</span><span>  assented  to,  the  price  being  very  high,  and</span><span>  a  new  sile  of  thirteen  acres  being  given</span><span>  by  the  Government  in  exchange.  Had</span><span>  such  a  bargain  been  made  with</span><span>  Rockhampton  it  would  have  been</span><span>  stigmatised  as  a  swindle,  but  it  passed</span><span>  under  protest.  This  year,  therefore,  the</span><span>  trustees  lina  inemselve*  with  ,£13,000</span><span>  in  the  bank,  and  thirteen  acres  of  land</span><span>  in  tile  finest  portion  of  the  city,  or  rather</span><span>  the  suburbs.  A  pretty  strong  financial</span><span>  position  for  an  irresponsible  body  to</span><span>  ;  occupy,  the  reader  will  say.  But  it  did</span></p> <p><span>  not  satisfy  the  princely  conceptions  of</span><span>  thc  Board.  They  concluded  that  the</span><span>  necessary  buildings  would  cost  .£33,000</span><span>  instead  of  ,£13,000  ;  and  at  the  very  end</span><span>  of  the  session,  when  nearly  all  the</span><span>  country  members  were  gone,  they  pre-</span><span>  vailed  upon  the  Treasurer  lo  place</span><span>  ,£20,000  on  the  Supplementary  Loan</span><span>  Estimate.  It  was  interpreted  by  a  foot-</span></p> <p><span>  note  to  mean  a  loan  to  the  Brisbane</span><span>  Grammar  School  secured  upon  the</span><span>  Government  endowment  of  ,£jooo</span><span>  a-year,  equivalent  at  5  per  cent  to</span><span>  interest  upon  £20,000.  But  the</span><span>  Grammar  School  Act  makes  the  pay-</span><span>  ment  of  the  endowment  subject  to</span><span>  certain  conditions,  and  it  is  strictly</span><span>  a  grant  in  aid  of  current  wants.  To</span><span>  divert  it  into  buildings  would  be  a</span><span>  violation  of  the  spirit,  if  not  the  letter  of</span><span>  the  Act.  Rockhampton  might  almost  as</span><span>  reasonably  ask  a  large  loan  secured  on</span><span>  the  endowment  to  build  its  grammar</span><span>  school.  Had  the  Brisbane  claim  been</span></p> <p><span>  granted,  our  trustees  would  have  had  an</span><span>  equal  claim  to  .£2000  as  an  immediate</span><span>  grant,  and  ,£10,000  as  representing  the</span><span>  capitalised  value  of  the  prospective</span><span>  endowment.  That  is,  assuming  that  only</span><span>  ,£1000  has  been  locally  raised.  But  as</span><span>  we  hope  to  ultimately  raise  ,£2000,  our</span><span>  Trustees  would  be  able  to  claim  ,£4000</span><span>  as  a  building  grant,  and  ,£20,000  as  a</span><span>  loan,  were  Rockhampton  placed  on  the</span><span>  same  level  as  Brisbane.  The  same  may</span><span>  be  said  of  Ipswich,  Toowoomba,  and</span><span>  Maryborough,  and  indeed  of  any  other</span><span>  town  in  which  the  preliminary  contribu-</span><span>  tion  required  by  the  Act  could  be</span><span>  raised.  We  do  not  say  that  our  Trustees</span><span>  would  prefer  so  large  a  claim,  but  the</span><span>  .possibility  of  their  doing  so  brings  ont</span><span>  the  project  of  the  Brisbane  men  in  bold</span></p> <p><span>  relief.  But  the  worst  feature  of  the  case</span><span>  remains  to  be  pointed  out.  The  Go-</span><span>  vernment  dared  not  place  such  an  item</span><span>  on  thc  Estimates-in-Chief,  but  must  j</span><span>  introduce  it  on  the  last  Government  day  '</span><span>  of  the  session  among  other  items  of  j</span><span>  unforeseen  expenditure.  Fortunately  !</span></p> <p><span>  there  was  enough  honesty  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  Assembly  to  spoil  so  discreditable  a  1</span><span>  trick,  and  we  notice  with  pleasure  that  j</span><span>  the  strongest  opponents  of  the  item  were</span><span>  found  among  southern  men,  though  not</span><span>  among  the  members  for  the  city.</span><span>  According  to  practice,  no  item  involving</span><span>  any  important  principle  should  be  placed</span><span>  on  Supplementary  Estimates,  especially</span><span>  when  introduced  at  the  eleventh</span><span>  hour  of  the  session.  This  occur-</span></p> <p><span>  rence,  coupled  with  the  bargain</span><span>  forced  upon  the  Government  in  the</span><span>  exchange  of  sites,  proves  that  irrespon-</span></p> <p><span>  sible  nominee  bodies  are  even  more</span></p> <p><span>  addicted  than  municipal  corporations</span><span>  to  looting  the  Treasury.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Brisbane  Waterworks  Board  is</span><span>  anothcrbody  which  Unowshow  to  defraud</span><span>  the  public.  When  the  Brisbane  Water-</span><span>  works  were  originally  authorised  many</span><span>  years  ago  by  special  Act,  it  was  intended</span><span>  thal  their  cost  should  be  advanced  as  an</span></p> <p><span>  interest-bearing  loan  to  the  Corporation.</span><span>  Afterwards  the  maller  was  placed  in  thc</span><span>  hands  of  .1  nominee  board,  and  an</span><span>  amending  Act  being  found  necessary,</span><span>  one  of  tlie  provisions  enabling  the</span><span>  Government  to  claim  interest  was  cither</span></p> <p><span>  accidentally  or  designedly  omitted,</span><span>  although  thc  implication  was  still  in</span><span>  favour  of  the  interest  being  recoverable.</span><span>  The  Hoard,  however,  refused  to  pay</span><span>  interest  on  the  .£65,000  obtained,  and</span><span>  spent  all  their  surplus  income  in  exten-</span><span>  sions.  Bul  eventually  the  Government</span><span>  arranged  that  all  the  public  offices  in  the</span><span>  city  should  be  supplied  free  of  water</span><span>  rates,  a  concession  which  was  a  virtual</span><span>  payment  of  a  portion  of  the  interest.</span><span>  Three  years  ago  il  was  found  thal  large</span><span>  extensions  of  the  works  were  necessary</span><span>  to  meet  thc  increasing  wants  of  thc  city,</span><span>  and  that  an  additional  loan  of  ,£2  5,000</span><span>  would  he  wanted.  But  the  Board,  like</span><span>  other  repudiators  before  them,  found</span><span>  difficulty  in  borrowing,  and  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  ol  thc  day  (Mr,  Macalistcr's)</span></p> <p><span>  refused  to  place  an  nmonnt  on  the  Loan</span><span>  Estimates  unless  thc  Board  covenanted  to</span><span>  pay  interest  at  five  per  cent  on</span><span>  the  new  toan,  leaving  the  water  rates  for</span></p> <p><span>  Government  offices  to  stand  as  a  set-off</span></p> <p><span>  against  the  interest  accruing  on  the  old</span><span>  one.  This  was  not  an  unsatisfactory</span><span>  arrangement,  but  when  the  first  interest</span><span>  on  the  new  loan  became  due,  the  Hoard</span><span>  soumit  .1  means  of  evading  it.  So,</span><span>  ignoring  the  previous  arrangement  about</span><span>  water  rates,  the  Hoard  sent  in  a  claim</span><span>  for  ^£2540,  covering,  it  is  said,  four</span><span>  years'  payments,  and  intimating  that  on</span><span>  this  charge  being  acknowledged  by  thc</span><span>  Government,  the  Hoard  would  pay  the</span><span>  amount  owing  as  interest  upon  the  new</span></p> <p><span>  loan.  This  proposal  Mr.  Dickson  ac-  j</span><span>  ccpted,  and  by  that  act  practically  agreed</span><span>  to  forego  the  interest  on  the  original</span><span>  loan,  and  to  wipe  out  ,£65,000  worth  of</span><span>  governmental  assests  without  parliament-</span><span>  ary  authority.  What  makes  thc  act  more</span><span>  reprehensible  is  the  circumstance  that</span><span>  the  question  as  to  the  liability  of  the</span><span>  Hoard  to  pay  the  interest  was,  and  still</span><span>  remains,  under  consideration  by  the</span><span>  Attorney-General,  and  that  in  his  corres-</span><span>  pondence  with  thc  Hoard  the  Treasurer</span><span>  was  still  claiming  ¿37,000  arrears  of</span></p> <p><span>  interest.  When  the  .matter  came  to  be</span><span>  discussed  in  the  House,  Mr.  Dickson</span><span>  looked  thoroughly  ashamed  of  himself,</span><span>  and  yet  tried  to  defend  his  action  by  mysti-</span><span>  fying  the  transaction.  The  House  would</span><span>  not  tolerate  the  fraud,  however,  and  thc</span><span>  clever  Waterworks  Board  are  worsted  in</span></p> <p><span>  their  attempt  to  defriud  the  Treasury.</span></p> <p><span>  These  occurrences  show  that  however</span><span>  favourable  the  Government  may  pretend</span><span>  to  be  to  central  snd  northern  claims,</span><span>  they  can  be  ""go:  at""  by  unscrupulous</span><span>  metropolitans,  anc  cannot  be  trusted  to</span><span>  defend  the  Treasury  when  some  Brisbane</span><span>  swindle  is  contemplated.

Tlic  revision  of  thc  rolls  was  pro-</span><span>  ceeded  with,  and  all  but  that  for  Rockhampton</span><span>  were  completed,  when  thc  Court  adjourned</span><span>  until  this  morning.</span></p> <p><span>  Tfrc  telegraph  has  boen  sadly  confusing  our</span><span>  cable  newe  for  some  days  past,  some  messages</span><span>  having  come  to  hand  several  dayß  lato,  while</span><span>  others  have  been  so  mixed  up  as  to  bc  scarcely</span><span>  intelligible.  Wo  now  6nd  that  two  important</span><span>  messages,  dated  London  April  G,  published  in</span><span>  last  Saturday's  Courier,  have  not  been  sent  by</span><span>  wire  to  Rockhampton.  Ono  of  those  relates</span><span>  to  a  collision  in  thc  Thames  by  which  GOO</span><span>  lives  were  lost  ;  and  the  other  contains  the</span><span>  important  intelligence  that  the  Sultan  Abdul</span><span>  Hamcd  H.  has  been  superseded,  and  Midhat</span><span>  Pasha,  late  Grand  Vizier  in  Turkey,  has  been</span><span>  recalled  from  England  to  Constantinople.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  reference  to  thc  accident  to  Messrs.  J.  P.</span><span>  Bell  and  De  Burgh  Persse  at  the  Comet  on</span><span>  Thursday  morning  last,  wo  learn  that  those</span><span>  gentlemen  started  from  the  Comet  Township</span><span>  in  an  American  express  waggon,  and,  attempt-</span><span>  ing  to  cross  au  old  bridge  which  is  now</span><span>  seldom  used,  they  drove  down  thc  approach</span><span>  which  was  very  steep  with  a  sharp  curve  at  thc</span><span>  bottom),  when  it  was  found  that  the  drag</span><span>  would  not  act,  and  seeing  that  they  were  in</span><span>  great  danger  of  toppling  over  the  embankment</span><span>  at  thc  turning  point,  they  fortunately  saved</span><span>  themselves  by  jumping  out  in  good  time.  Thc</span><span>  waggon  and  horses  turned  completely  over,</span><span>  falling  into  four  feet  of  mud,  tho  horses  floun-</span><span>  dering  on  their  backs.  With  the  assistance  of</span><span>  the  road  party,  who  happened  to  bc  at  hand,</span><span>  the  horses  and  waggon  were  800)1  extricated</span><span>  and  brought  back  to  the  township-the  only</span><span>  damage  being  to  thc  hooded  covering  of  the</span><span>  waggon,  which  was  somewhat  tora,  thc  horses</span><span>  not  being  injured  in  Ibo  slightest.  Thc  dam-</span><span>  age  was  quickly  repaired  by  a  blacksmith  at</span><span>  the  township,  and  the  travellers  were  enabled</span><span>  to  resume  their  journey  with  no  greater  IOSB</span><span>  than  a  delay  of  two  days.  Their  escape  from</span><span>  a  serious  accident  was  almost  miraculous.</span></p> <p><span>  FJÍOM  information  we  received  a  few  weeks</span><span>  ago,  wo  had  good  reason  to  believe  that  the</span><span>  stcamtug  Fitzroy,  recently  built  at  thc  yards</span><span>  of  Messrs.  .1.  Walker  and  Company,  Mary-</span><span>  borough,  to  the  order  of  the  Government,  for</span><span>  service  in  thc  Fitzroy  Uiver,  would  not  bc</span><span>  finished  and  fit  for  work  until  some  time  about</span><span>  February  next.  It  was  stated  that  ow  ing  tn</span><span>  a  large  quantity  of  other  Government  work  in</span><span>  the  hands  of  Messrs.  Walker,  thc  eugine  and</span><span>  internal  fittings  of  thc  steamer  were  being</span><span>  proceeded  with  very  slowly-hence  thc  appre-</span><span>  hended  delay  in  ber  completion.  But  we  now</span><span>  learn  that  Mr.  W.  C.  Clements,  Town  Surveyor,</span><span>  visiting  Maryborough  on  his  return  from  llris</span><span>  !  hanc,  went  on  hoard  thc  new  steamer,  and</span></p> <p><span>  found  her  boiler  being  placed  in  position,  and</span><span>  was  told  by  thc  builders  that  they  would  have</span><span>  her  ready  in  two  months.  We  hope  this</span><span>  latest  report  will  prove  correct,  fur  the</span><span>  steamer  lias  been  a  long  time  in  build-</span><span>  ing,  and  however  desirable  it  may  he</span></p> <p><span>  to  have  work  of  this  kind  done  in  the</span><span>  colon}',  thc  public  interests  should  not  bc</span><span>  permitted  to  sillier  Itv  dilatoriness  in  its</span><span>  execution.

Herald  that,  on</span><span>  August  31,  Benjamin  Rogers  Brown  was</span><span>  charged  at  tho  Water  Police  Court,  Sydney,</span><span>  by  detective  Boyland  on  a  Queensland  warrant,</span><span>  with  obtaining  £240  from  one  Abraham</span><span>  Martin  by  false  pretences  on  the  27th  July</span><span>  last.  Tiic  facts  of  thc  case  as  set  forth  in  thc</span><span>  warrant  arc  as  follow  :-Thc  prisoner  had</span><span>  shown  Mr.  Martin,  who  resides  in  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton,  a  case  of  gold  weighing  24oz.,  which  ho</span><span>  stated  to  bc  thc  product  of  a  crushing  of</span><span>  stone  from  thc  Cummins  Reef,  Crocodile</span><span>  gold-fields,  and  bc  further  stated  that  auy</span><span>  quantity  of  stone  yielding  the  same  amount  of</span><span>  gold  could  bc  readily  obtained  from  the  same</span><span>  reef,  by  which  statements,  which  were</span><span>  alleged  to  bc  false,  the  prisoner  had  induced</span><span>  tho  said  Abraham  Martin  to  give  bim  a  pro-</span><span>  missory  note  for  £230  for  a  quarter-share  in</span><span>  the  reer.  Thc  Bench  remanded  thc  prisoner</span><span>  to  Rockhampton  ;  bail  Avas  allowed,  himself</span><span>  in  £500  and  two  sureties  in  £250  each.  Wc</span></p> <p><span>  understand  that  Brown  is  expected  to  arrive</span><span>  here  in  thc  Boomerang,  R.S.,  and  will  bo</span><span>  brought  before  thc  Police  Court  to  answer  the</span><span>  charge  preferred  against  him.</span></p> <p><span>  Two  cakes  of  smelted  gold  were  yesterday</span><span>  banked  in  Rockhampton,  from  thc  Duke  of</span><span>  Brittany  Roof,  Raglan  Crock.  Thc  cakes</span><span>  together  weigh  130  ozs.,  and  arc  thc  produce</span><span>  of  a  crushing  of  about  174  tons  of  stone,  show-</span><span>  ing  an  average  yield  of  about  15  dwt.  per</span><span>  ton.  Thia  is  thc  first  crushing  of  stone  from</span><span>  underground  in  thc  Duke  of  Brittany,  previous</span><span>  parcels  from  this  claim  having  been  only</span><span>  surface  stone.  .  tunnel  is  now  being  driven</span><span>  into  thc  hill,  and  thc  above  crushing  obtained</span><span>  therefrom  shows  an  improved  yield,  as  com-</span><span>  pared  with  stone  previously  taken  from  the</span><span>  surface,  of  about  5  dwt.  per  tou.  Tho  reef  in</span><span>  thc  tunnel  is  2ft.  Oin.  in  thickness,  and  both</span><span>  Hie  hanging  aud  foot  walls  aro  well  defined.</span><span>  The  gold  from  this  claim  commands  £3  10s.</span><span>  per.  oz.  in  Rockhampton.  The  owners  aro</span><span>  very  well  satisfied  with  their  property,  and</span><span>  very  naturally  expressed  surprise  that  No.  1</span><span>  North  and  South  of  thc  same  lino  of  reef  have</span><span>  not  becu  taken  up.  But  they  had  scarcely</span><span>  made  this  remark  when  itappcars  that  Messrs.</span><span>  W.  Flynn  and  party  gave  notice  to  the  Gold</span><span>  Warden  that  they  had,  in  accordance  with</span><span>  the  usual  regulations,  taken  possession  of</span><span>  abandoned  ground,  measuring  400  by  400  feet</span><span>  on  tiic  above  lino  of  reef.  Thc  reefs  in  the  Cen-</span><span>  tral  districts  arc  evidently  in  poor  repute  at  thc</span><span>  present  time,  and  estimated  far  below  their</span><span>  actual  value.  But  a  reaction  in  public  opinion</span><span>  amongst  thc  mining  community  of  the  colony</span><span>  on  tin's  subject  may  soon  bo  loooked  for.

Mr.  Miles  mui</span><span>  have  seen  in  thc  V  'orks  Office  the  replie</span><span>  obtained  to  the  C  lamber  of  Commerc</span><span>  circular  last  year,  <  f  which  ninety-five  pt</span><span>  cent  were  in  favoi  r  of  a  due  west  lim</span><span>  and  only  five  per  cent  in  favour  of  th</span><span>  Clermont  deviatii  n.  He  must  kno</span><span>  also  that  the  P  emier  and  the  lal</span><span>  Minister  for  Work  ;  kept  the  course  <</span><span>  the  line  undecid  d  for  clectioneerin</span><span>  purposes  simply.  They  thought  that  t</span><span>  pretending  to  favc  UT  the  Clermont  roul</span><span>  they  might  win  th  it  constituency  in  tl</span><span>  event  of  a  disso  ution.  They  knev</span><span>  moreover,  that  thare  was  a  party  of  shot</span><span>  sighted  people  ii  Brisbane  who  wai</span><span>  to  run  the  northe  n  line  to  Clermont  i</span><span>  order  that  they  n  ly  find  an  excuse  fi</span><span>  running  the  soi  them  line  to  Tambi</span><span>  And  this  is  the  g  ime  the  local  advocati</span><span>  of  a  forked  line  ;  re  playing.  For  mei</span><span>  party  purposes,  <  r  for  mere  sake  of  o</span><span>  posing  the  Charnier  of  Commerce,  thc</span><span>  urge  thc  people  of  this  district  to  c</span><span>  their  own  throats.  But  we  are  confide:</span><span>  that  Mr.  Miles  wi  1  be  shrewd  enough  '</span><span>  observe  which  wa  r  the  railway  ought  I</span><span>  go,  and  that,  coll  ague  of  Mr.  Dougl</span><span>  though  he  be,  bel  will  not  damage  tl</span></p> <p><span>  interests  of  the  district  for  the  sake  of</span></p> <p><span>  party  object.  \</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  reason  to  believe  that  tl</span></p> <p><span>  Chamber  of  Commerce  will  interview  tl</span></p> <p><span>  Minister  on  the  raiftvay  question  befo</span><span>  his  departure.  They  have  manifest!</span></p> <p><span>  too  much  interest  in]  this  matter  of  rou</span><span>  to  permit  any  misun  lerstanding  to  ari</span><span>  in  respect  to  it.  T  ley  know  that  it</span><span>  a  vital  question,  and  that  by  comparisc</span><span>  with  it  bridges  am  buildings  are  t!</span><span>  merest  bagatelle.  ^nd  they  want</span></p> <p><span>  ascertain,  if  possible  what  the  Govei</span><span>  ment  really  intend  tc  do.</span></p> <p><span>  We  can  point  ou  :  what  ought  to  1</span><span>  done.  Barcaldine  3owns  is  just  t;</span><span>  same  distance  iron  Emerald  Dow:</span><span>  that  Roma  is  frorr  Dalby.  Railw</span><span>  communication  is  j  ist  as  necessary  i</span><span>  the  one  route  as  or  thc  other,  and  t</span><span>  prospects  of  the  lin  s  proving  rcmunei</span><span>  ti  ve  are  about  equal.  Then,  we  SE</span><span>  let  the  Douglas  Government  do  i</span><span>  tlje  Northern  lina  in  187S  what  t</span></p> <p><span>  Macalister  Government  did  for  t</span><span>  Southern  line  in  1  875.

We  care  1  lot  how  the  funds  a</span><span>  raised.

"<p><span>  FRIDAY,  NOVEMBER  22,  1678.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  desirableness  of  publishing  a  Daily</span><span>  Hansard  has  been  under  the  considera-</span><span>  tion  of  the  Victorian  Legislative</span><span>  Assembly,  and  a  Committee  of  that</span><span>  Chamber  has  recently  brought  up  a</span><span>  report  on  the  subject.  The  Committee</span><span>  makes  no  recommendation,  but  suggests</span><span>  two  plans  by  which  it  thinks  the  project</span><span>  might  be  carried  out.  The  report,  how-</span><span>  ever,  betrays  a  remarkable  want  of</span><span>  practical  knowledge  on  the  part  of  the</span><span>  Committee,  and  the  proposals  put  forth</span><span>  are  so  crude  and  so  absurd  that  we  are</span><span>  forced  to  thc  conclusion  that  the  various</span><span>  members  of  the  Committee  are  either</span><span>  incapable  of  forming  a  sensible  opinion</span><span>  on  the  subject,  or  are  too  indifferent</span><span>  about  it  to  apply  themselves  to  its</span><span>  serious  consideration.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Committee  suggests  as  one  plan,</span><span>  that  the  Government  should  employ  a</span><span>  staff  of  nine  reporters,  and  should  erect</span><span>  powerful  machinery  at  the  printing</span><span>  office,  and  produce  a  daily  official  publi-</span><span>  cation  which  should  be  given  to  the</span><span>  various  newspapers  in  Melbourne  to</span><span>  circulate  with  their  daily  issues.  By</span><span>  this  means,  it  is  stated  that  the  widest</span><span>  possible  circulation  will  be  obtained.</span></p> <p><span>  I  But  the  Committee  bases  its  estimate  of</span></p> <p><span>  expenditure  on  a  daily  circulation  of</span><span>  !  10,000  copies.  In  what  way  such  a  small</span></p> <p><span>  number  could  be  made  to  serve  the</span></p> <p><span>  I  purpose  intended,  or  be  disposed  of</span><span>  1  satisfactorily,  the  Committee  does  not</span></p> <p><span>  condescend  to  explain.  The  number</span><span>  mentioned  would  not  be  sufficient  for</span><span>  the  Argus  alone,  and  to  supply  all  the</span><span>  Melbourne  dailies  would  require  the</span><span>  daily  production  of  at  least  50,000</span><span>  copies.  But  the  provincial  papers</span><span>  have  also  to  be  considered.  Pos-</span></p> <p><span>  sibly  the  Committee  contemplates  con-</span><span>  fining  Hansard  to  the  metropolitan</span><span>  papers,  but  if  the  official  publication  is  to</span><span>  be  of  any  advantage  to  the  papers  which</span><span>  circulate  it,  the  leading  provincial  dailies</span><span>  will  with  good  reason  protest  against  a</span><span>  monopoly  of  it  beinç  given  to  their</span><span>  metropolitan  contemporaries.  And  to</span><span>  supply  it  to  all  the  papers  in  Victoria</span><span>  would  require  the  dailyproduction  of  from</span><span>  90,000  to  100,000  copies.  We  see  no</span><span>  mention  of  any  charge  to  be  made  for</span><span>  the  official  publication,  which  is  evi-</span><span>  dently  intended  to  be  supplied  free.</span><span>  This  assumes  that  thc  papers  will,  as  a</span><span>  matter  of  course,  be  only  too  ready  to</span><span>  take  the  official  publication  and  distri-</span><span>  bute  it  gratuitously.  And  the  rank</span><span>  absurdity  of  this  notion  stands  out  in</span><span>  bold  relief  when  we  come  to  the  next</span></p> <p><span>  proposal-to  the  effect  that  the  Hansard  j</span><span>  publication  shall  include  the  Government</span><span>  Gazette  and  the  Polite  Gazette,  and  that</span><span>  all  Government  advertisements  are  to  be</span></p> <p><span>  inserted  in  it  at  a  saving  of  from  j£i  7,000</span><span>  to  .£20,000  per  annum.  The  Com-</span><span>  mittee  has  an  alternative  plan  that  the</span><span>  debates  should  be  reported  by  a  Govern-</span><span>  ment  staff  and  the  copy  supplied  by  them</span><span>  to  the  publishers  of  the  Melbourne</span><span>  dailies  ;  but  every  newspaper  man  knows</span><span>  that  this  would  be  utterly  impracticable.</span></p> <p><span>  As  regards  the  first-named  plan,  we</span><span>  are  free  to  allow  that  the  Govern-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  Gazette  is  a  very  imperfect  medium</span><span>  for  Government  announcements,  and  it</span><span>  would  be  an  immense  advantage  to  give</span><span>  such  announcements  thc  widest  possible</span><span>  circulation.  But  is  it  reasonable  to</span><span>  suppose  that  proprietors  of  unofficial</span><span>  journals  will  perform  this  valuable</span></p> <p><span>  service  to  the  State  at  their  own  cost  ?</span></p> <p><span>  A  newspaper  holding  a  commanding</span><span>  and  leading  position  has  acquired  that</span><span>  vantage  ground  by  the  expenditure  of  a</span><span>  large  amount  of  capital  and  unremitting</span><span>  iiuustry,  for  which  a.  return  is  chiefly  ob-</span><span>  tained  in  receipts  for  advertisement.  But</span><span>  the  Victorian  Hansard  Committee  inno-</span><span>  cently  assumes  that  newspaper  pro-«</span><span>  prietors  will  gladly  circulate  with  their</span><span>  own  journals  an  official  publication</span><span>  containing  State  announcements  which</span><span>  thc  Government  now  pays  for  ss  ordinary</span></p> <p><span>  advertisements  at  current  rates.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Committee  also  overlooks</span><span>  the  fact  that  Hansard  is  only</span><span>  publis!-""'!  buring  the  sitting  of  Pariia</span></p> <p><span>  mein,  ü.ju  would  therefore  be  only</span><span>  available  as  the  official  advertising</span><span>  medium  during  part  of  thc  year.  But  a</span><span>  still  greater  misconception  exists  as  to</span><span>  the  expenditure  the  contemplated  publi</span><span>  cation  would  entail.  A  daily  circulation</span><span>  of  10,000  copies  they  estimate  would</span><span>  cost  about  ,£10,000  per  annum.  Now,</span><span>  unless  a  monopoly  of  the  Hansard</span><span>  publication  were  given  to  one  par-</span><span>  ticular  journal-and  we  do  not  see  how</span><span>  that  could  be  done-Hansard  would</span><span>  have  to  be  offered  on  such  terms  as</span><span>  would  induce  newspaper  proprietors</span><span>  generally  to  avail  themselves  of  it  ;  and</span><span>  this  would  certainly  not  be  possible  if</span><span>  the  publication  were  to  be  made</span><span>  the  medium  for  Government  adver-</span><span>  tising.  But  supposing  it  were  taken</span><span>  by  all  the  leading  newspapers  in  Vic-</span><span>  toria,  the  number  printed  would  be</span><span>  nearer  100,000  than  ro.ooo,  and  the</span><span>  annual  cost  would  be  more  like  £50,000</span><span>  than  the  trifling  sum  set  down  by  the</span></p> <p><span>  nnnimilli«e  as  snfrîcipnî  fnr  I  hi»  wnrlr.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Daily  Hansard  in  Queensland</span><span>  appears  now  to  be  successfully  estab-</span><span>  lished,  and  there  is  no  likelihood  of</span><span>  its  being  dispensed  with  for  some</span><span>  years  to  come.  It  doubtless  contains</span><span>  matter  that  would  be  better  omitted.</span><span>  The  small  talk,  the  twaddle,  and  the</span><span>  personalities  which  occupy  too  large  a</span><span>  share  of  the  time  devoted  to  Parlia-</span><span>  mentary  debates,  might  be  suppressed,</span><span>  even  from  the  official  reports,  with</span><span>  great  advantage  to  the  public.</span><span>  But  the  Queensland  Hansard,  with  all</span><span>  its  defects,  serves  a  good  purpose,  and  is</span><span>  appreciated,  both  by  members  of  the</span><span>  Assembly  and  by  a  considerable  section</span><span>  of  the  public.  Before  the  Daily  Han</span><span>  sari  was  published  the  whole  colony</span><span>  was  chiefly  dependent  for  its  Par-</span><span>  liamentary  news  on  the  reports  furnished</span><span>  by  the  Brisbane  Courier.  Those  reports</span><span>  were  excellent  of  their  kind,  and  for</span><span>  ordinary  purposes  were  far  superior  to</span><span>  the  more  extended  reports  given  in</span><span>  Hansard.  But  they  were  mere  sum-</span><span>  maries,  prepared  chiefly  for  .  metro-</span><span>  politan  readers,  and  proceedings  in</span><span>  Rinlianfwti  oîu(îtry':constituênciés'  were</span><span>  not  unfrequently  ignored  altogether.  In</span><span>  Victoria,  however,  the  circumstances  arc</span><span>  different.  The  people  of  that  colony</span><span>  are  not  dependent  upon  one  journal,  as</span><span>  was  formerly  the  case  in  Queensland,</span><span>  for  reports  of  Parliamentary  proceed-</span><span>  ings.  The  Melbourne  Argus,  the  Age,</span><span>  and  the  Herald  publish  independent</span><span>  reports  of  the  proceedings  in  the  Vic-</span><span>  torian  Parliament,  and  between  them</span><span>  very  little  of  importance  escapes  public</span><span>  notice.  It  is  quite  possible,  therefore,</span><span>  that  a  Daily  Hansard  in  that  colony</span><span>  would  cost  more  than  it  would  be  worth,</span><span>  and  we  are  quite  sure  that  a  publication</span><span>  of  the  character  suggested  by  the</span><span>  Victorian  Hansard  Committee  will  not</span><span>  be  attempted.</span></p> <p><span>  Now  that  the  hot  weather  is  upon  us,  a</span><span>  simple  method  of  keeping  meat  in  good  con</span><span>  dition  would  be  worth  knowing.  From  one</span><span>  of  our  exchanges  we  learn  that  the  following</span><span>  recipe  is  used  with  success  :  -Put  2  ozs.</span><span>  powdered  borax  in  a  bucket  of  water;  add</span><span>  ]  oz.  carbonate  of  soda,  and  rinse  the  meat  in</span><span>  the  liquid.</span></p> <p><span>  FROM  the  Mercury  we  learn  that  the  sittings</span><span>  of  the  Distriot  Court  commenced  at  Mackay</span><span>  on  Tuesday  the  12th  instant,  before  bis  Honor</span><span>  Judge  Hely,  Mr.  C.  E.  Chubb  prosecuting  o</span></p> <p><span>  behalf  of  the  Crown.  There  were  only  three</span><span>  criminal  cases  on  the  calendar,  and  no  civil</span><span>  business.  The  following  prisoners  were  dealt</span><span>  with  :-J.  Harris,  charged  with  obtaining  £X</span><span>  12s.  Gd.  from  C.  E.  DutaUis  by  means  of  a</span><span>  valueless  cheque,  was  found  guilty,  and  sen</span><span>  tenced  to  seven  months'  imprisonment  in</span><span>  Rockhampton  gaol.  Sarah  and  Agues  Hol-</span><span>  land,  mother  and  daughter,  were  charged  vith</span><span>  concealment  of  birth.  The  latter  prisoner,</span><span>  against  whom  no  bill  had  been  filed,  was  dis-</span><span>  charged,  and  the  former  haring  pleaded  guilty,</span><span>  was  fined  £20,  and  ordered  to  find  sureties  to</span><span>  keep  the  peace  for  twelve  months-herself  in</span><span>  the  sum  of  £25,  and  two  sureties  in  the  sum</span><span>  of  £25  each.  There  were  peculiar  circum-</span><span>  stances  in  connection  with  the  case  which  his</span><span>  Honor  took  into  consideration.</span></p> <p><span>  A  SPECIAL  meeting  of  the  Committee  of  tho</span><span>  Port  Curtis  and  Leichhardt  District  Hospital</span><span>  was  held  in  the  Court  House,  yesterday  after-</span><span>  noon  at  four  o'clock.

Faunce  (Treasurer),  and  D.  Campbell</span><span>  (Resident  Surgeon  and  Secretary.)  Mr.</span><span>  C.  S.  D.  Melbourne  was  also  present.</span><span>  The  Chairman  explained  that  the  meet-</span><span>  ing  had  been  convened  for  thc  purpose  of</span><span>  authorising  the  payment  of  a  sum  of  money,</span><span>  held  in  trust  by  the  Committee,  to  the  widow</span><span>  of  a  patient  named  Jacob  Forciella,  who  died</span><span>  in  the  Hospital  some  time  ago.  Mr.  Mel-</span><span>  bourne  produced  the  original  probate  of  the</span><span>  will  of  which  a  copy  had  been  previously</span><span>  furnished,  and  made  application  for  the</span><span>  amount  (£140  6s.

Upon  the  motion  of  Mr.  Hall,</span><span>  seconded  by  Mr.  Leigh,  thc  Treasurer  was</span><span>  authorised  to  pay  thc  amount  to  Mr.  Mel-</span><span>  bourne.  The  Chairman  produced  a  telegram</span><span>  received  from  tho  Colonial  Secretary's  office,</span><span>  notifying  that  the  Colonial  Treasurer  had</span><span>  been  advised  to  forward  the  balance  of  £300</span><span>  of  thc  vote  for  the  erection  of  the  additional</span><span>  iring  to  the  Hospital.

The  special  object  of  the</span><span>  meeting  was  thc  fixing  of  the  site,  but  owing</span><span>  to  the  absence  of  three  of  the  Trustees-(Dr.</span><span>  Callaghan  attended  later)-it  was  moved  by</span></p> <p><span>  the  Rev.

A.  Hay,  M.A.,  of  Rock-</span><span>  ton,  preaching  both  in  the  morning  and  even-</span><span>  ing.  The  church,  which  was  enlarged  about</span><span>  twelve  months  ago,  was  filled  on  both  occa-</span><span>  sions,  and  the  collections  made  were  very</span></p> <p><span>  liberal.  The  interest  manifested  in  the  ser-</span><span>  vices  was  a  gratifying  testimony  both  to  the</span><span>  esteem  in  which  the  minister  of  the  church,</span><span>  the  Rev.  Mr.  Meiklejohn,  is  held,  and  to</span><span>  the  people's  appreciation  of  the  services</span><span>  rendered  last  year  by  Mr.  Hay  on  the  re-</span><span>  opening  of  the  church.  On  Tuesday  even-</span><span>  ing,  the  12th  instant,  a  soiree  was  held  in</span><span>  the  Court  House,  at  Springsure,  the  building</span><span>  being  kindly  granted  for  the  purpose  by</span><span>  Mr.  J.  G.  Macdonald,  P.M.  After  an  inviting</span><span>  tea,  which  was  creditable  to  the  culinary</span><span>  skill  of  the  ladies  who  furnished  the  tables,</span><span>  the  company  adjourned  to  the  church,  where</span><span>  a  public  meeting  was  held,  presided  over  by</span><span>  Mr.  J.  G.  Macdonald.  Practical  and  highly  in-</span><span>  teresting  addresses  were  delivered  by  the</span><span>  Chairman,  the  Rev.  Mr.  Meiklejohn,  and</span><span>  Mr.  Hay  -  Mr.  Meiklejohn  speaking on friend-</span><span>  ship,  and  Mr.  Hay  on  the  office  and  difficulties</span><span>  of  the  Christian  minister,  and  the  duties  his</span><span>  people  owe  to  him.  A  special  vote  of  thanks</span><span>  was  accorded  to  the  choir  with  Mr.  Milliken,</span><span>  the  usual  conductor,  and  Mr.  Walker,  who</span><span>  presided  at  the  harmonium,  and  who  took  an</span><span>  active  part  in  the  preparation  of  the  musical</span><span>  selections,  which  were  varied  in  character,</span><span>  and  executed  in  a  manner  that  would  have</span><span>  done  credit  to  a  metropolitan  choir.  Spring-</span><span>  sure  is  to  be  congratulated  on  the  harmony</span><span>  that  prevails  amongst  the  various  denomi-</span><span>  nations  there,  and  on  the  prosperity  that</span><span>  attends  the  labours  of  the  resident  minister.</span></p> <p><span>  COLONIAL  SECURITIES.-  In  bis  report  of</span><span>  September,  Mr.  William  Westgarth  has  the</span><span>  following  with  regard  to  Australian  loans  and</span><span>  securities  :-""  The  New  South  Wales  proposed</span><span>  loan  being  withdrawn,  the  four  per  cents  of</span><span>  that  colony  still  stand  at  ninty-seven.

These  reduced  prices,  which  are</span></p> <p><span>  lower  by  about  four  per  cent  than  at  the</span><span>  middle  of  the  year,  are  due  partly  to  the  pros-</span><span>  pect  of  heavy  borrowing,  bat  much  also  to  a</span></p> <p><span>  complete  change  in  roe  condition  of  the  ¡</span><span>  market,  which  has  not  now  'the  volume  of</span><span>  money'  (to  use  the  business  phrase)  that</span></p> <p><span>  existed  for  a  long  previous  period  for  invest-  j</span><span>  monte  of  this  kind.

"<p><span>  CORRESPONDENCE.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  METEORS.</span></p> <p><span>  TO  THE  EDITOR  OF  THE  MORNING  BULLETIN.</span></p> <p><span>  SIR,-Referring  to  a  letter  signed  C.  H.</span></p> <p><span>  Barwell,  relative  to  his  seeing  a  meteor  on  &nbsp;</span><span>  last  Tuesday  in  broad  daylight,  I  may  state</span><span>  that  I  saw  a  meteor  about  sunset  on  last</span><span>  Tuesday  in  the  direction  of  Emu  Park.  Also</span><span>  on  7th  of  last  April,  about  sunset,  I  saw  a</span><span>  very  brilliant  meteor,  of  a  pale  green  colour</span><span>  with  long  red  tail  pass  close  to  the  earth,  and</span><span>  feeling  curious,  I  hunted  up  some  of  the  best</span><span>  authorities  on  the  subject.</span></p> <p><span>  It  appears  for  a  long  period  little  notice  was</span><span>  taken  of  shooting  stars,  meteorites,  &c.,  it</span><span>  being  believed  they  owed  their  origin  to</span></p> <p><span>  gaseous  exhalations  from  the  earth  which</span><span>  became  ignited  in  the  atmosphere.  At  some</span><span>  times,  however,  the  number  seen  was  im-</span><span>  mensely  greater  than  at  others,  and  instances</span><span>  were  recorded  in  which  the  display  was  termed</span><span>  a  meteoric  shower.  Humboldt  speaks  of  one</span><span>  which  he  witnessed  on  13th  November,  1799,</span><span>  in  South  America,  and  says,  ""Towards</span><span>  morning  we  witnessed  a  most  extraordinary  &nbsp;</span><span>  scene  of  shooting  meteors  ;  thousands  of  bodies</span><span>  and  falling  stars  succeeded  each  other  during</span><span>  four  hours.  From  the  beginning  of  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  phenomenon  thero  was  not  a  space  in  the  firma-</span><span>  ment  equal  in  extent  to  three  diameters  of  the</span><span>  moon,  which  was  not  filled  every  instant  with</span><span>  bodies  or  falling  stars.""  On  the  13th  of  No-</span><span>  vember,  1831,  another  grand  meteoric  shower</span><span>  occurred,  which  was  followed  by  others  on</span><span>  to  same  date  in  1832  and  1833.  The last of</span><span>  these  seems  to  have  been  one  of  the  most  bril-  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  liant  and  magnificent  on  record-the  whole</span><span>  sky  appeared  on  fire,  and  in  many  places  the</span><span>  utmost  terror  was  caused  by  the  sight.  One</span><span>  observer  thus  describes  it :-""The scene was</span><span>  truly awful,  for never  did rain  fall much</span><span>  thicker  than  the  meteors  fell  towards  the</span></p> <p><span>  earth.""  Many  of  the  meteors left behind</span></p> <p><span>  them  luminous  trains  which  remained visible</span></p> <p><span>  for  a  considerable  period.-  One  remarkable</span><span>  fact observed during the  shower was, that all</span><span>  the  shooting  stars  appeared  to  radiate  from  a</span></p> <p><span>  point  in  the  Constellation  Leo  ; this</span></p> <p><span>  point  remained  constant  while  the  shower</span><span>  lasted,  and  this  showed  that  these meteors</span></p> <p><span>  arose from  some source  altogether independent  of the  earth and  removed from its surface, as</span></p> <p><span>  otherwise  the  spot  would  have  moved  with</span><span>  the  rotation  of  the  earth.  The news of these</span></p> <p><span>  displays  soon  spread,  and  directed  the atten-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  of  astronomers  in  all  countries  to  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  subject.  The  fact  of  these  grand</span><span>  displays  having  occurred  for  three  con-</span><span>  secutive  years,  about  the  13th  of  No-</span><span>  vember,  naturally  attracted  notice,  as  it  &nbsp;</span><span>  seemed  to  indicate  a  periodical  character;</span><span>  accordingly,  on  that  date  in  the  following</span></p> <p><span>  year,  a  strict  watch  was  kept  by  many  &nbsp;</span><span>  astronomers,  and  though  no  very  marked</span><span>  display  occurred  the  numbers seen were very</span></p> <p><span>  far  above  the  average.  Continued  observations</span><span>  prove  that  at  this  period  there  is  always  a  &nbsp;</span><span>  much  larger  display  of  these  bodies  than  at  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  other  times  of  the  year.  Several  facts  seem</span><span>  most  clearly  to  show  that  their  origin  is</span><span>  beyond  the  surface  of  the  earth,  and  the</span></p> <p><span>  annual  periodicity  indicates  that  in  certain  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  parts  of  its  orbit  the  earth  is  passing  through  &nbsp;</span><span>  a  portion  of  space  specially  crowded  with</span></p> <p><span>  them.  The  opinion  now  is  that  there  is  a  &nbsp;</span><span>  ring  of  these  bodies  revolving  round  the  sun  ;</span><span>  this ring is  about the size  of the orbit  of the earth  ; it is  inclined to the  ecliptic at an  angle of about  17°, cutting it  just in the  part in which the earth is situated on the 13th of</span></p> <p><span>  November,  so  that  at  that  period  the  earth  is</span></p> <p><span>  actually  passing  through  the  ring.  The  fact  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  of  a  star  shower  being  so  much  more brilliant</span></p> <p><span>  one  year  than  another  can  be  accounted  for</span><span>  if  we  suppose  that  in  one  part  of  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  ring  there  is  a  rich  group  of  these</span></p> <p><span>  bodies,  and  that  this  group  revolves  in  its  &nbsp;</span><span>  orbit  in  about  eleven  days  less  than  the  earth</span></p> <p><span>  takes.  This  group  extends  over  some  small  &nbsp;</span><span>  portion  of  the  ring,  so  that  at  times  the  earth  &nbsp;</span><span>  may  for  two  or  three  successive  years  pass</span><span>  through  or  near  the  dense  portion.</span></p> <p><span>  sides  November,  August  is  a  period  at  &nbsp;</span><span>  which  large  numbers  of  these  bodies  may  be  &nbsp;</span><span>  seen,  and  the  display  is  more  certain  and  uni-  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  form.  Some  astronomers  suppose  that  the</span><span>  August  and  November  meteors  are  parts  of  the  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  same  ring,  which  therefore  cuts  the  earth's  &nbsp;</span><span>  orbit  in  two  points.  The  opinion  that  they</span><span>  are  two  separate  rings  is  more  generally  re-</span><span>  ceived  ;  it  is  believed  that  they  are  small  solid</span><span>  bodies  revolving  round  the  sun,  and  as  they</span><span>  travel  in  a  contrary  direction  to  the  earth, the</span><span>  velocity  with  which  they  enter  our  atmosphere</span><span>  is  very  great;  the  resistance  of  the  air  soon</span><span>  checks  this  motion,  but  by  the  friction  thus</span></p> <p><span>  produced,  the  body  is  so  intensely  heated  that</span><span>  it  becomes  luminous,  and  ultimately  is en-</span></p> <p><span>  tirely  consumed.  The  weight  of  most  of  them  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  it  believed  to  be  very  small,  possibly  not more</span><span>  than  a  few  grains.  There  are  a  few  which  are</span><span>  much  larger,  and,  owing  to  their  size,  pass</span></p> <p><span>  unconsumed  through  the  atmosphere,  and  fall  &nbsp;</span><span>  upon  the  earth's  surface;  these  are  usually  &nbsp;</span><span>  distinguished  as  meteorites,  and  are  sometimes</span></p> <p><span>  divided  into  aerolites  or  meteoric  stones,  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  aerosiderites,  or  pieces  of  meteoric  iron.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  In  April,  1803,  a  brilliant  fireball  was  seen  in  &nbsp;</span><span>  Normandy,  travelling  very  rapidly,  shortly</span><span>  after  which  a  loud  explosion  was  heard,  and  a</span></p> <p><span>  great  number  of  pieces  of  stone  fell  to  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  ground,  nearly  3000  being  collected.  When  &nbsp;</span><span>  picked  up  soon  after  their  fall,  these  bodies  are</span><span>  found  to  be  intensely  hot.  On  chemical</span><span>  examination  no  new  elements  have  been  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  covered  in  them  ;  they  are  found  to  contain  iron,  &nbsp;</span><span>  usually  in  a  large  proportion,  and  nickel  is</span><span>  nearly  always  found  associated  with  it.</span><span>  Various  hypotheses  have  been  propounded  to</span><span>  account  for  the  invariability  in  the  amount  of</span><span>  heat  emitted  by  the  sun;  the  supposition  put</span><span>  forth  by  Mayer,  and  developed  by  Waterston</span></p> <p><span>  and  Sir  W.  Thomson,  is  that  the  heat  which</span><span>  the  sun  loses  by  radiation  is  replaced  by</span><span>  the  fall  of  meteoric  stones  or  aerolites  against</span></p> <p><span>  its  surface.</span></p> <p><span>  These  are  what  we  know  as  shooting  stars  ;</span><span>  these  fall  against  the  sun  with  a  velocity  far</span><span>  transcending  anything  met  with  on  the  sur-</span><span>  face  of  our  globe,  and  by  their  impact  develop</span><span>  an  amount  of  heat  which  more  than  com-</span><span>  pensates  what  the  sun  loses  by  radiation.</span></p> <p><span>  Lightning  comes  under  the  head  of</span><span>  Luminous  Meteors.  There  are  several</span><span>  kinds  of  lightning  flashes  :  the  zig-zag</span><span>  flashes,  which  move  with  great  velocity</span><span>  in  the  form  of  a  line  of  fire  with  sharp  out-</span><span>  lines;  the  flashes  which,  instead  of  being  linear</span><span>  like  the  preceding,  fill  the  entire  horizon  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  without  having  a  distinct  shape.  Another</span><span>  kind  is  heat  lightning,  because  it illuminates</span></p> <p><span>  the  summer  nights  without  any  clouds  above</span><span>  the  horizon,  and  without  producing  any  sound.</span><span>  Then  the  globe  lightning,  appearing  in  the</span><span>  form  of  globes  of  fire.  These  are  sometimes</span></p> <p><span>  visible  for  as  much  as  ten  seconds,  descending</span></p> <p><span>  from  the  clouds  to  the  earth  with  such  slow-</span><span>  ness  that  the  eye  can  follow  them  ;  they  often</span><span>  rebound  on  reaching  the  ground,  or  burst  and</span><span>  explode  with  a  noise  like  that  of  the  report  of</span></p> <p><span>  many  cannon.</span></p> <p><span>  I  am,  Sir,  &c.,</span></p> <p><span>  METEOR.</span></p> ",Article,1878-07-11,CORRESPONDENCE.

The  peculiarity  of</span><span>  the  situation  is,  however,  that  these  plans</span><span>  have  been  smuggled  through  Parliament</span><span>  in  a  manner  wholly  unprecedented.  In</span><span>  moving  their  adoption,  the  Minister  for</span><span>  Works  gave  not  a  particle  of  information</span><span>  with  respect  to  them.  The  length  of</span><span>  line  was  not  mentioned,  the  route  was</span><span>  not  specified,  the  character  of  the</span><span>  country  was  not  described,  nor  were  the</span><span>  future  intentions  of  the  Government</span><span>  foreshadowed.  It  is  quite  certain  that</span><span>  the  Southern  members  were  wholly  un-</span><span>  aware  of  thc  importance  of  the  motion,</span><span>  and  that  they  are  still  under  the  impres-</span><span>  sion  that  the  line  is  going  somewhere  in</span><span>  the  direction  of  Clermont  and  Aramac.</span><span>  Their  combined  ignorance  and  innocence</span><span>  on  this  question  would  b»-»«»uoing  but</span></p> <p><span>  .-?HJI  iw.Wra>«u3nmce  that  it  furnishes</span></p> <p><span>  a  melancholy  illustration  of  the  way  in</span><span>  which  the  ruling  party  in  the  House</span><span>  is  led  blindfold.  It  is  fortunate</span><span>  that  the  leading  members  ol  the  Opposi-</span><span>  tion  thoroughly  understood  what  was</span><span>  being  done,  and  being  satisfied  that  it</span><span>  was  the  right  thing,  judiciously  abstained</span><span>  from  criticism  when  the  Minister  for</span><span>  Works  threatened  to  withdraw  the  plans.</span><span>  In  the  Upper  House,  on  the  following</span><span>  day,  Mr.  Mein  moved  their  adoption,</span><span>  and  is  reported  by  the  Courter  to  have</span><span>  said  that  the  extension  to  Retreat  Creek</span><span>  would  be  available  whether  the  line  were</span><span>  afterwards  carried  due  west  or  north-</span><span>  west.  This  assurance  he  professed  to</span><span>  give  on  the  authority  of  the  surveyors,</span><span>  and  it  completely  removed  the  suspicions</span><span>  entertained  by  members  of  the  revising</span><span>  Chamber,  with  one  exception,  the  Hon.</span><span>  James  Gibbon,  who  is  credited  with</span><span>  being  the  wealthiest  land  owner  in  the</span><span>  metropolis.  _  He  feared  these  plans</span></p> <p><span>  would  commit  the  Government  to  the</span><span>  due  west  extension,  and  refused  to  be</span><span>  satisfied  by  Mr.  Mein's  assurance.  He</span><span>  therefore  called  for  a  division,  but</span><span>  was  left  in  the  potential  minority</span><span>  of  one.  Those  who  ought  to</span><span>  know  profess  scepticism  as  to</span><span>  the  existence  of  the  alleged  report  of</span><span>  the  surveyors,  and  are  confident  that</span><span>  they  did  not  recommend  the  ex-</span><span>  tension  to  Retreat  Creek  in  the  belief</span><span>  that  the  line  could  ever  take  a  North-</span><span>  west  course  beyond  that  point.  Such  a</span><span>  route  would  be  simply  preposterous,</span></p> <p><span>  and  no  Government  could  ever  dare  ask</span><span>  Parliament  to  sanction  it.  Your  readers</span><span>  will  be  relieved,  however,  that  a  happy</span><span>  settlement  has  been  at  length  arrived  at,</span><span>  and  if  the  southern  people  hereafter</span><span>  complain  that  their  representatives  were</span><span>  hoodwinked,  the  responsibility  will  rest</span><span>  with  a  Queen-street  Ministry,  who  carried</span><span>  out  the  Opposition  policy  in  this  respect</span><span>  while  leading  the  public  to  believe  that</span><span>  they  were  steadfastly  opposing  it.  The</span><span>  incident  will  teach  our  Clermont  and</span><span>  Copperfield  readers  not  to  again  place</span><span>  their  trust  in  Southern  politicians,  who</span><span>  buy  support  while  furtively  selling  those</span><span>  who  guilelessly  render  it.  There  is  one</span></p> <p><span>  crumb  of  comfort  for  thc  Clermont  and</span><span>  Copperfield  friends  of  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  however.  Mr.  Mein  assured</span><span>  the  Upper  House  that  the  Cler-</span><span>  mont  extension  was  a  work  to</span><span>  which  the  Government  were  very  de-</span><span>  cidedly  committed,  butthey  werenotyet  in</span><span>  a  position  to  bring  down  plans  for  the</span><span>  construction  of  that  line.  The  sincerity</span><span>  of  this  assurance  may  be  judged  by  one</span><span>  pregnant  fact.  Fifteen  months  ago  the</span><span>  Minister  for  Works  issued  instructions</span><span>  for  the  immediate  survey  of  the  line  from</span><span>  Emerald  Downs  to  Clermont.  In  reply</span></p> <p><span>  he  was  informed  that  the  work  could  not</span><span>  be  done  with  the  then  staff,  and  autho-</span><span>  rity  was  requested  to  engage  an  addi-</span><span>  tional  surveyor.  The  authority  was</span><span>  neither  given  nor  refused,  the  request</span><span>  was  pigeon-holed,  and  Ministerial  ad-</span><span>  mirers  were  mercilessly  deceived,  led</span><span>  to  believe  throughout  that  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  were  at  least  determined  to  carry</span><span>  the  line  through  Craven  Gap,  and  that</span><span>  the  only  obstacles  in  their  way  were  a</span><span>  few  squatters'  agents  in  Rockhampton.</span><span>  Your  Peak  Downs  friends  have  kept  up</span><span>  an  increasing  agitation  in  the  hope  oi</span><span>  winning  their  object,  and  they  will  still</span><span>  be  encouraged  notto  despair.  Thebunch</span><span>  of  carrots  is  replaced  by  an  armful  ol</span><span>  green  stuff,  and  the  change  of  food  is</span><span>  expected  to  promote  digestion,  and  keep</span><span>  the  tractable  animal  in  an  amiable  humour</span><span>  until  after  the  general  election.  Then,</span><span>  if  troublesome,  he  will  have  to  be  satis-</span><span>  fied  with  occasional  spoonfuls  of  Treasury</span><span>  fodder,  or  else  take  his  chance  in  the</span><span>  spinifex  desert</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court  on  Saturday,  before  thc</span><span>  Police  Magistrate,  the  cases  in  v.luc'n  William</span><span>  Tntton  is  concerned  in  thc  non-payment  ""1</span><span>  wages  to  hia  servants  were  proceeded  with,</span><span>  the  whole  of  the  morning  being  occupied  in</span><span>  arguing  the  points  of  law  raised,  and  tl  io</span><span>  further  hearing  of  thc  cases  was  adjourned</span><span>  until  this  morning.</span></p> <p><span>  I  TuSRB  was  a  very  fair  house  at  the  Theatre</span></p> <p><span>  lioyal  ou  Saturday  uight.  Tho  two-act  drama,</span><span>  ""Ireland  as  it  was,""  represents  tho  evils</span><span>  arising  from  absentee  landlords  and  grasping</span><span>  middlemen  in  that  country.  Judy  Q'Trot,  or</span><span>  widow  O'Flalierty,  found  an  exponent  in  Miss</span><span>  Stephenson,  who  played  the  warm-hearted,</span><span>  impulsive,  and  imperfectly-educated  Irishwo-</span><span>  man  to  perfection.  Of  the  other  characters  Mr</span><span>  Seagravc  and  Mr.  Carey  excelled,  the  latter</span><span>  making  tho  very  beat  of  tho  small  element  of</span><span>  comedy  in  his  part.  But  the  most  attractive</span><span>  part  of  thc  programme  was  the  burlesque  on  the</span><span>  celebrated  opera  ""  La  Somnámbula.""  Miss</span><span>  Stephenson  takes  all  her  parts  so  well,  that  it</span><span>  is  difficult  to  decide  which  is  lier  forte  ;  hut</span><span>  the  spectator  has  no  difficulty  in  deciding  into</span><span>  what  department  of  acting  she  throws  lier</span><span>  whola  life,  with  thocvident  intention  of  enjoy</span><span>  ing  herself  as  well  as  pleasing  those  who  soo  her.</span><span>  And  tlic  feeling  is  like  the  measles,  very  infec-</span><span>  tious  ¡  for  no  sooner  did  the  fair  actress  ap-</span><span>  pear  as  A  Icsnio,  than  the  house  were  in  perfect</span><span>  harmony  with  the  exquisite  fun  of  the  bur-</span><span>  lesque,  and,  seeming  determined  to  be  pleased,</span><span>  at  once  were  so.  Miss  Maggie  Forde,  as  Hh'iiio,</span><span>  had  a  very  flattering  reception,  the  audience</span><span>  raising  a  perfect  storm  of  applause,  and  con-</span><span>  tinuing  it  so  long  as  to  seem  embarrassing  to</span><span>  the  fair  danseuse,  who  could  not  sec,  or</span><span>  apparently  would  not,  that  thc  spectators</span><span>  could  look,  gladly  for  a  much  longer</span><span>  time  to  the  perfect  gracefulness  of  ber</span><span>  movements,  and  baten  to  the  pleasing</span><span>  sweetnesB  of  her  voice.  In  response  to  the</span><span>  encor'.  Miss  Forde  repeated  a  portion  of  her</span><span>  performance  to  the  evident  gratification  of  the</span><span>  house.  Tlie  make-up  of  Mr.  G.  P.  Carey  as</span><span>  Amina  (a  village  beauty-in  her  own  opinion)</span><span>  was  one  of  the  most  laughable  spectacles  that</span><span>  gentleman  has  yet  presented  in  Rockhampton.</span><span>  So  loud  and  continued  was  the  uproar  that  it</span><span>  was  impossible  for  him  to  proceed  for  a  few</span><span>  minutes  with  the  words  of  his  part.  And  it</span><span>  was  evident  that  Mr.  Carey  caught  the</span><span>  enthusiasm  of  the  audience.  Shakespeare</span><span>  must  have  had  such  a  man  in  IIÍB  mind's  eye</span><span>  when  he  spoke  of  ""a  fellow  of  infinite  jest.""</span><span>  This  gentleman  departs  from  us  to-morrow,</span><span>  but  he  leaves  behind  Iii  in  many  mental  portraits.</span><span>  The  fun-provoking  twinkle  of  his  eye  and  thc</span><span>  genial  mirthfulness  of  bis  smile  will  bc  fresh</span><span>  in  the  minds  of  hundreds  in  Rockhampton</span><span>  long  after  ho  is  gone.  The  other  characters</span><span>  in  the  burlesque  do  not  call  for  special  notice.</span><span>  With  one  or  two  exceptions  they  Mere  up  in</span><span>  their  parts  ;  hut  without  exception  all  con-</span><span>  tributed  «ucoooafully  to  spend  in  innocent</span><span>  mirthfulness  as  agreeable  an  hour  as  any</span><span>  previously  passed  duringthe  season.  To-night's</span><span>  performance,  the  lost,  is  for  the  benefit  of  Mr.</span><span>  Wills,  when  we  hope  there  will  be  a  full</span></p> <p><span>  house.</span></p> <p><span>  OwrKa  to  the  late  hour  at  which  the</span><span>  address  was  presented  to  Miss  Clara  Stephen-</span><span>  son  (Mrs.  F.

H.  Seagrave,  on  behalf</span><span>  of  tlie  Company.)  Miss  Stephenson  said  she</span><span>  could  not  express  how  gratified  sbo  felt  at</span><span>  being  held  in  such  high  estimation,  and  she</span><span>  availed  herself  of  the  opportunity  to  thank</span><span>  thc  whole  of  her  Company  for  their  untiring</span><span>  efforts  to  support  her  all  through  tho  season.</span><span>  Sometimes  they  had  pretty  hard  work  through</span><span>  the  constant  change  of  programme.  However,</span><span>  she  had  always  found  them  up  to  the  mark  ;</span><span>  and  she  trusted  that  all  had  established</span><span>  themselves  favourites  in  Rockhampton,  not</span><span>  only  as  actor*  aud  actresses,  hut  as  ladies  and</span><span>  gentlomcn.  Addressing  the  audience  as  kind</span><span>  friends  rather  than  as  tho  conventional  phrase,</span><span>  she  thanked  them  for  their  hind  support</span><span>  during  their  somewhat  lengthened  visit.</span><span>  Three  months,  they  must  allow,  was  a  some-</span><span>  what  a  long  stay-and  some  weeks  had</span><span>  boen  very  dull,  and  not  sufficient  to  pay</span><span>  expenses  ;  hut  she  must  say,  that  when  she</span><span>  called  upon  them,  they  had  como  liberally</span><span>  forward.  She  had  tried  to  please,  and  hoped</span><span>  she  had  not  entirely  failed.  She  could  do  uo</span><span>  more,  and  therefore  it  was  most  gratifying  to</span></p> <p><span>  know  that  her  efforts  had  met  with  their</span></p> <p><span>  approbation.  She  would  always  entertain  tho</span><span>  kindliest  feelings  towards  the  people  of  Rock-</span><span>  hampton.

Thc  Secretary</span><span>  read  the  letter,  which  was  from  Mr.</span><span>  Robert  Uebden,  Secretary  of  Court  No.  2701,</span><span>  and  was  to  tho  effect  that  if  there  was  a  Past</span><span>  Ranger  in  Rockhampton  who  was  good  on  thc</span><span>  books  of  his  Court  lie  could  open  a  lodge  and</span><span>  initiate  members;  but  if  notan  nflieer  would</span><span>  have  to  be  sent  from  Brisbane.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  OCTOBER  31,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Macfarlane's  meeting  last  night was</span><span>  a  very  successful  one.  His  speech  occupied</span><span>  an  hour  in  delivery,  the  language  being  terse</span><span>  and  very  much  to  the  point.  We  hold  over</span></p> <p><span>  our  full  report  until  to-morrow,  and  for  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  present  merely  touch  upon  a  few  of  the  leading</span><span>  ideas  in  the  speech.  Mr.  Macfarlane  first  gave</span><span>  a  resume'  of  last  session,  defending  the  votes  he</span><span>  had  given  on  the  principal  measures  brought</span><span>  before  the  House.  He  supported  Mr.  Griffith's</span><span>  resolutions  for  University  Exhibitions,  because</span><span>  it  would  help  to  stimulate  the  whole  educa-</span><span>  tional  system.  The  Grammar  School  scholar-</span><span>  ships  had  been  of  immense  benefit  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  Primary  Schools,  and  the  University  Exhibi-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  tions would have a  similar effect. They had</span><span>  reason  to  be  gratified  with  the  change  in  public</span><span>  opinion  with  regard  to  the  Central  Railway.</span><span>  Until  very  recently  the  Rockhampton  agita-</span><span>  tion  for  railway  extension  westerly  had  been</span><span>  generally  stigmatised  as  intensely  selfish,  but</span><span>  it  was  now  generally  acknowledged  that  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  was  advocating  only  what  was  for</span><span>  the  good  of  the  whole  colony,  as  the  railway</span><span>  opened  up  the  splendid  lands  of  the</span><span>  West,  beginning  320  miles  from  Rockhampton</span><span>  and  extending  to  the  Adelaide  border.  This</span><span>  land  without  the  railway  could  only  be  used</span><span>  for  cattle  stations,  but  with  it  would  be  utilised</span><span>  for  sheep  and  in  time  for  agriculture.  He  re-</span><span>  ferred  to  his  recent  visit  to  the  Mitchell,  and</span><span>  said  that  he  believed  that  it  would  yet  be  a</span><span>  great  wheat  producing  country.  He  showed</span></p> <p><span>  the  injurious  policy  of  the  Railway  Reserves  &nbsp;</span><span>  Act,  which  compelled  lessees  to  buy  the  land</span></p> <p><span>  to  protect  their  holdings,  thus  locking  up  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  capital  which  would  have  been  better  em</span><span>  ployed  in  various  other  ways  in  improving</span></p> <p><span>  their  properties.  Speaking  of  the  Premier's  &nbsp;</span><span>  idea  of  ""  taking  the  squatters  into  our  con-</span><span>  fidence,""  and  calling  upon  them  to  pay  by</span><span>  highly  increased  rents  to  the  extent  of</span><span>  £100,000  per  annum  towards  the  cost  of  rail-</span><span>  ways,  he  said  it  could  not  be  done  -,  and  Mr.</span><span>  Griffith  said  that  such  a  course  would  be  illegal,</span><span>  as  the  rent  of  the  runs  was  fixed  by  statute,  and</span><span>  the  outside  squatter  had  a  lease  of  some</span><span>  sort  for  twenty-one  years.  Regarding  this</span><span>  subject,  as  was  elicited  afterwards  by</span><span>  a  question  from  Mr.  Rea,  he  was</span><span>  in  favour  of  Mr.  Buzacott's  proposal  for</span><span>  giving  a  better  tenure  for  a  portion  of  the</span><span>  runs  in  the  Western  districts  and  increasing</span><span>  the  rental.  Mr.  Dickson's  disparaging  re-  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  marks  upon  trunk  railways  were  severely</span><span>  criticised,  showing  conclusively  the  absurdity</span><span>  of  his  ascertion  that  they  were  made  almost</span><span>  exclusively  for  the  benefit  of  the  squatters,</span><span>  and  illustrated  his  argument  by  a  telling</span><span>  comparison  of  Brisbane  as  it  was  when</span><span>  he  visited  it  in  1865  and  Brisbane  as</span><span>  it  is  now.  The  Darling  Downs,  which</span><span>  before  the  era  of  railways  could  only</span><span>  be  occupied  tor  pastoral  purposes,  were  now</span></p> <p><span>  being  settled  by  the  farmer;  and  this  develop-</span><span>  ment  of  the  country  had  told  wonderfully</span><span>  upon  Brisbane,  its  terminal  port,  which  had  in</span><span>  a  few  years  grown  into  a  large  city,  thus  pro-</span><span>  viding  a  large  market  for  farm  produce,  and</span><span>  causing  the  lands  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the</span><span>  capital  to  be  extensively  cultivated.  He  de-</span><span>  fended  Mr.  M'Ilwraith's  loan  policy,  pointing  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  ont  that  the  three  millions  proposed  would  be</span><span>  principally  consumed  in  works  already  autho-</span><span>  rised  at  the  instance  of  the  present  Govern-</span><span>  ment.  He  also  showed  that  all  the  money</span><span>  was  not  to  be  raised  at  once,  but  that  the  loan</span><span>  should  be  placed  in  instalments  as  required.</span><span>  We  have  only  briefly  touched  upon  a  few  of</span><span>  the  points  of  Mr.  Macfarlane's  very  able  ad-</span><span>  dress,  and  a  good  deal  of  information  was</span><span>  elicited  by  questions  from  various  electors.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  employment  of  coloured  labour,  he  said</span><span>  that  he  believed  without  it  the  sugar  industry</span><span>  could  not  be  carried  on,  and  he  was  not  pre-  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  pared  to  sacrifice  that  industry.  He  would</span><span>  not  recommend  that  they  should  be  sent  to</span><span>  the  bush,  as  squatters  now  generally  con-</span><span>  sidered  ""they  were  really  not  cheap  labour  ;</span><span>  bnt  he  would  leave  them  free  to  en-</span><span>  gage  with  whom  they  pleased.  He  was  not  in</span><span>  favour  of  the  Permissive  Bill,  but  was  in</span><span>  favour  of  the  licensing  laws  being  amended</span><span>  with  a  view  to  the  testing  and  examination</span><span>  of  all  liquors  ;  he  believed  the  interest  on  thc</span><span>  £3,000,000  loan  should  be  defrayed  by</span><span>  the  judicious  use  of  lands  without</span><span>  additional  taxation.  The  railway  exten-</span><span>  sion  to  the  West  he  considered  a  benefit</span><span>  to  the  whole  colony,  and  the  burden</span><span>  of  cost  should  be  borne  by  the  whole  colony.</span><span>  He  was  not  in  favour  of  a  Gladstone  railway,</span><span>  the  authorisation  of  which  would  be  a</span><span>  scandalous  waste  of  public  money.  He  had</span><span>  taken  Mr.  Byerley's  part  when  that  gentleman</span><span>  waa  attacked  and  unfairly  treated  in  the</span><span>  Assembly,  he  was  of  opinion  that  the  bridge</span><span>  would  be  brought  to  a  successful  termination</span><span>  under  Mr.  Byerley's  superintendence  for  an</span><span>  amount  slightly  over  the  estimate.  He  was</span><span>  in  favour  of  a  free  system  of  primary  schools</span><span>  with  national  education,  was  opposed  to</span><span>  denominational  schools,  but  would  not  pledge</span><span>  himself  that  education  should  be  of  a  purely</span><span>  secular  character.  A  vote  of  confidence  was</span><span>  put  to  the  meeting  and  carried  almost  unani-</span><span>  mously.</span></p> <p><span>  At  the  Police  Court,  yesterday,  there  were</span><span>  no  cases  for  hearing.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Cooktown  Herald  contains  the  address</span><span>  of  Mr.  W.

"<p><span>  ""ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  NOVEMBER  2,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  another  column  will  be  found  a  report</span><span>  of  a  meeting  of  carriers  held  at  Comet-</span><span>  ville  for  the  purpose  of  organising  a</span><span>  Carriers'  Association.  It  was  resolved</span><span>  that  such  association  be  formed,  the</span><span>  object  being  to  protect  the  general</span><span>  interests  of  the  carrying  trade  against  the</span><span>  extreme  fluctuations  to  which  carriage</span><span>  rates  are  now  liable,  and  by  taking  such</span><span>  steps  as  shall  bring  the  trade  to  a  focus</span><span>  at  the  terminus  of  the  Central  Railway.</span><span>  To  further  the  general  object  it  is  also</span><span>  intended  to  have  a  paid  Secretary  to</span><span>  correspond  with  all  station  owners,  store-</span><span>  keepers  &c,  west  of  the  terminus,  and</span><span>  with  alt  merchants  and  forwarding  agents</span><span>  in  Rockhampton,  Brisbane,  Sydney,  and</span><span>  Melbourne,  doing  business  with  the</span><span>  Interior  of  Central  Queensland,  in  order</span><span>  that  loading  may  always  be  obtainable</span><span>  by  members,  at  the  current  rates  fixed</span><span>  by  the  Executive  Committee  of  the</span><span>  Association,  and  thus  save  them  the  great</span><span>  loss  of  time  and  money  incidental  to  the</span><span>  custom  of  individual  carriers  making</span><span>  trips  to  Rockhampton  for  loading,  and</span><span>  by  which  the  rates  are  needlessly  cut</span><span>  down.  There  is  also  to  be  an  office  and</span><span>  store  for  the  associated  carriers  at</span><span>  Cometville.  The  name  of  the  Society  is</span><span>  to  be  ""  The  Great  Western  Carriers  As-</span><span>  sociation.""</span></p> <p><span>  The  working  of  this  association  may</span></p> <p><span>  be  beneficial  to  all  concerned  if  con-</span></p> <p><span>  ducted  on  sound  principles,  and</span><span>  rather  for  the  purpose  of  collecting</span><span>  loading  in  a  systematic  way  than</span><span>  for  raising  the  carriage  rates.  It</span><span>  is  highly  probable  that  by  judicious</span><span>  co-operation  the  carriers  may  be  able  to</span><span>  reduce  their  expenses  and  save  much</span><span>  time  which  is  now  wasted,  and  thus</span><span>  leave  for  themselves  a  larger  margin  of</span><span>  profit  without  increasing  the  rates  above</span><span>  the  present  average.  If  this  be  the</span><span>  simple  object  of  their  combination,  it</span><span>  will  undoubtedly  result  in  good,  both  to</span><span>  themselves  and  those  with  whom  they  do</span><span>  business.  But  the  report  of  the  meeting</span></p> <p><span>  shows  that  much  more  than  this  is  con-</span></p> <p><span>  templated.  The  carriers  propose  to</span><span>  associate  to  enable  them  to  compete</span><span>  with  a  certain  large  carrying  firm  which</span><span>  it  would  appear  has  at  present  superior</span><span>  facilities  and  thereby  secures  to  itself  the</span><span>  lion's  share  of  the  trade.  With  this</span></p> <p><span>  matter  we  have  nothing  to  do.  But  if</span><span>  we  rightly  understand  the  movement,</span><span>  there  is  still  another  object  aimed  at,  and</span><span>  that  is  nothing  less  than  the  fixing  of  the</span><span>  rates  of  carriage  tn  an  arbitrary  manner</span><span>  by  the  Carriers'  Executive  Committee</span><span>  who  are  to  be  the  sole  judges  of  what  is</span><span>  fair  and  just;  and  the  squatters  and</span><span>  merchants  are  to  be  coerced  into  acqui-</span><span>  escence  with  the  terms  imposed.  This</span><span>  would  be  an  unwise  interference  with</span><span>  the  course  of  trade,  and  the  laws  of</span><span>  supply  and  demand  ;  and  if  such  inter-</span><span>  ference  be  really  contemplated,  we  may</span><span>  at  once  warn  the  association  that  one</span><span>  combination  of  this  kind  naturally  pro-</span><span>  vokes  another,  causing  much  irritation</span><span>  and  ill-feeling,  and  the  effect  would  be</span><span>  extremely  prejudicial  to  the  trade  of  the</span><span>  district,  the  carriers  themselves  in  all</span><span>  likelihood  being  the  greatest  sufferers.</span><span>  It  is  also  worthy  of  notice,  that  any</span><span>  attempt  to  raise  the  charge  above  what</span><span>  is  obtainable  under  a  system  of  free  and</span><span>  unrestricted  competition,  is  injudicous,</span></p> <p><span>  inasmuch  as  it  would  attract  carriers  from</span></p> <p><span>  other  places  who  would  refuse  to  recog-</span><span>  nise  the  Association,  and  thus  not  im-</span><span>  probably  bring  about  its  downfal,  to  be</span><span>  followed  by  a  period  of  excessively  low</span><span>  rates  and  ruinous  competition.</span></p> <p><span>  Quite  possibly,  however,  we  misjudge</span><span>  the  aims  of  the  promoters  of  the  new</span><span>  society.  There  is  doubtless  ample</span><span>  scope  for  organised  action  without</span><span>  going  beyond  legitimate  bounds,  and,</span><span>  as  we  have  already  hinted,  much</span><span>  might  be  done  in  contracting  for</span><span>  loading  and  collecting  it  for</span><span>  the  carriers,  and  in  other  ways</span><span>  economising  time  and  money  which</span><span>  would  be  beneficial  to  the  members  of</span><span>  the  association,  whilst  giving  to  no  one</span><span>  outside  any  just  cause  for  complaint.</span><span>  Thc  usefulness  and  success  of  the  Great</span></p> <p><span>  Western  Carriers  Association  will  there-</span><span>  fore  depend  very  largely  upon  the  exer-</span><span>  cise  of  judgment  and  moderation  in  the</span><span>  conduct  nf  its  business.</span></p> <p><span>  MBMBEIIS  of  tho  Presbyterian  Church  will</span><span>  observe  by  advertisement  that  a  communion</span><span>  service  will  be  held  to-morrow.</span></p> <p><span>  OUR  readers  at  Cometville  will  notice  that</span></p> <p><span>  an  adjourned  meeting  of  carriers  will  be  held</span><span>  this  evening,  in  thc  Shaksvicaro  Hotel,  at</span><span>  that  place,  to  consider  thc  ways  and  means  of</span><span>  organising  a  Carriers'  Association.</span></p> <p><span>  Fou  the  convenience  of  a  number  of  electors</span><span>  of  thc  Leichhardt  at  the  coming  election,  the</span><span>  Returning  Officer  notifies  thc  following  ad-</span><span>  ditional  polling  places  :-Wallaroo,  Dingo,</span><span>  Blackwater,  and  Duaringa.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Customs  collections  at  this  port  from</span><span>  thc  21st  to  the  31st  October  inclusive,</span><span>  amounted  to  £4313  13s.  ii.

A  telegram  received  by  the  business</span><span>  manager,  Mr.  T.  Kelly,  states  that  death</span><span>  occurred  in  Sydney  at  a  quarter  past  eight</span><span>  o'clock  last  night.  Mr.  Budden  had  for  years</span><span>  boen  in  failing  health,  and  several  weelu  ago</span><span>  Mrs.  Budden  aud  family  were  summoned  to</span><span>  Sydney  in  consequence  of  the  danserons  symp-</span></p> <p><span>  toms  which  his  casu  presented.  The  sad  '</span><span>  event  was  therefore  not  unexpected.  Mr.  Bud-</span><span>  den  arrived  in  Rockhampton  in  1862,  and</span><span>  first  opened  business  iu  Bolsover-street.</span><span>  Thence  he  removed  to  Bast-street,  where  bis</span><span>  premisos  wero  burnt  to  the  ground  some  five</span><span>  years  afterwards,  the  disaster  inflicting  a</span><span>  heavy  loss  upon  their  owner,  lie,  however,</span><span>  soon  recommenced  business,  and  it  has  since</span><span>  ranked  among  tho  largest  and  »noBt  pros-</span><span>  perous  concerns  in  town.  Mr.  Budden  was  a</span><span>  successful  merchant,  hut  there  is  reason  to</span><span>  fear  that  his  temperament  was  too  sensitive</span></p> <p><span>  to  bear  the  worry  of  a  large  business.  As  j</span></p> <p><span>  a  townsman  he  did  not  take  an  active  part  in</span><span>  public  affairs,  hut  his  sympathies  and  means</span></p> <p><span>  were  always  counted  upon  in  a  good  cause.  '</span></p> <p><span>  OWING  to  the  elections  engrossing  public</span><span>  attention  for  some  «laya  past,  we  have  not,</span><span>  until  now,  had  an  opportunity  of  noticing  the</span><span>  prospectus  ol  the  Carriers'  Association  in</span><span>  course  of  formation  in  this  district.  Wc  are</span></p> <p><span>  gratified  to  learn  that  the  promoters  emphati-</span><span>  cally  disclaim  any  desire  to  use  thc  Association</span><span>  as  a  combiuatiou  lo  raise  the  rates  of  carriage</span><span>  -bcyondcstahlishing,  if  possible,  moreuuiform</span><span>  rates  all  thc  year  round,  subject  to  the  seasons,</span><span>  the  course  of  trade,  and  the  laws  of  supply</span><span>  and  demand.  They  rather  aim  to  economise  thc</span><span>  time  and  money  of  the  cim  iers  connected  with</span><span>  tho  Association  in  such  a  maimer  as  to  in-</span><span>  crease  their  profit»  whilst  conserving  the</span><span>  interests  of  merchants  andsquatters  with  whom</span><span>  they  do  lmsinoss.  Thc  object  is  unexceptiona-</span><span>  ble,  aud  if  carried  out  with  prudence  and</span><span>  enerby,  the  Association  should  Ijenolit</span><span>  its  members  and  at  thc  same  time  render</span></p> <p><span>  good  service  to  thc  producing  and  mercantile</span><span>  interests  of  the  district.  Mr.  Taylor,  of  jthe</span><span>  firm  of  Frauk  Taylor  and  Co.,  the  general</span><span>  agents  of  the  Association,  is  now  in  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  aud  intends  waiting  upon  the  re-</span><span>  ceiving  agents  and  merchants  of  the  town  to</span><span>  solicit  business  for  the  carriers.  The  numbers</span><span>  already  enrolled  represent  about  seventy</span><span>  teams,  and  the  provisional  directory  calculate</span><span>  upon  having  not  less  than  !00  teams  placed</span><span>  regularly  at  their  disposal  to  start  from  the</span><span>  Comet  to  the  various  up  country  stations  in</span><span>  accordance  with  a  prenrranzcd  plan  so</span><span>  that  each  carrier  shall  have  his  fair</span><span>  chan  ce  of  loading,  taking  his  tum  as  it  comes</span><span>  and  it  will  bo  the  duty  of  the  agents  of  the</span><span>  Association  to  collect  up-loading  at  the  (Jomet</span><span>  and  make  all  necessary  arrangements  for</span><span>  return  teams,  seeing  that  wool  and  other  pro-</span><span>  duce,  as  it  arrives  at  tho  Comet,  is  promptly</span><span>  sent  on  by  rail  to  the  cousiguees  in  Rock-</span><span>  hampton.  They  will  also  see  that  all  business</span></p> <p><span>  entrusted  to  them  is  attended  to  without</span></p> <p><span>  delay,  and  that  teamsters  proceed  with  their</span><span>  loading  with  all  reasonable  dispatch.  The</span><span>  expenses  of  the  carriers'  agency  will  be</span><span>  entirely  borne  by  the  Association,  aud  no</span><span>  agency  commission  will  he  charged  against</span><span>  consignors  and  consignees.</span></p> <p><span>  MR.  T.  M.  PATIÎRSON'S  meeting  last  night</span><span>  was  held  in  tho  store  lately  occupied  by</span><span>  Messrs.  Cherry  and  Lowry,  instead  of  the</span><span>  Theatre.  Mr.  Sandel  explained  that  the</span><span>  meeting  was  to  have  bean  held  in  the  Theatre,</span><span>  but  that  place  forming  poition  of  an  hotel,</span><span>  the  candidate's  election  might  bc  rendered</span><span>  invalid  under  the  provisions  of  thc  Act.  There</span><span>  was  a  good  attendance  considering  the  accom-</span><span>  modation  afforded.  Mr.  W.  K.  Higson</span><span>  occupied  the  chair,  and  prefaced  the  candi-</span><span>  date's  address  by  stating  tlutt  never  before</span><span>  had  such  concerted  action  and  energy</span><span>  on  the  part  of  the  working  and  mid-</span><span>  dle  classes  been  required  as  now  in  securing</span><span>  a  representative  of  their  interests.  Mr.</span><span>  Paterson  was  well  received,  and  adverted  to</span><span>  the  fact  of  his  having  nt  previous  assemblages</span><span>  commented  and  expressed  his  opinion  on  the</span><span>  political  questions  of  the  day.  Those  who</span><span>  had  not  heard  had  learnt  in  public  print  what</span><span>  that  opinion  was.  He  thanked  those  who</span><span>  had  exhibited  strong  energy  in  soliciting  for  a</span><span>  representative  of  the  working  clauses,  a</span><span>  position  which  had  been  offered  him,  and</span><span>  which  he  had  gladly  accepted.  He  would</span><span>  return  to  Brisbane  without  a  single  vote</span><span>  rather  than  that  it  should  be  said  that</span></p> <p><span>  anyj  man  had  been  dragged  or  cajoled</span><span>  into  voting  for  him.  Tho  speaker,  in  the</span><span>  course  of  a  long  address,  stated  that  he  was</span><span>  opposed  to  the  exteusion  of  thc  railway  if  its</span><span>  cost  were  to  be  defrayed  by  taxation  through</span><span>  the  Custom  House,  which  was  a  draining  of</span><span>  the  people's  pocket.  He  favoured  the  exten-</span><span>  sion  by  the  sale  of  Crown  lands.  He  was  a</span><span>  Queenslander  at  heart,  and  hod  interests  in</span><span>  Uockbampton  which  he  intended  to  hold,  and</span><span>  he  had  felt  it  his  duty,  now  that  he  was</span><span>  in  independentcircunittances,  to  answer  tbecall</span><span>  made  by  the  working  classes,  and  come  forward</span><span>  as  their  champion.  He  trusted  that  they  would</span><span>  weigh  well  the  respective  candidates,  and  re-</span><span>  turn  those  they  thought  the  best  aud  most  able</span><span>  men  to  represent  their  interests.  Mr.  Pater-</span><span>  son,  in  answer  to  questions,  said  that  he  would</span><span>  not  support  any  Ministry  that  favoured  the</span><span>  construction  of  the  Gladstone  railway,  and</span><span>  was  in  favour  of  the  present  Education  Act,</span><span>  and  he  bebeved  in  the  eight  hour  system.</span><span>  Thc  Bpeaker  was  loudly  applauded  in  con-</span><span>  cluding,  and  was  followed  by  Mr.  L.  Sandel</span><span>  who  dwelt  at  some  length  on  the  merits  of  the</span><span>  respective  candidates  and  the  present  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  in  an  amusing  speech  interspersed  with</span><span>  anecdotes,  which  were  apparently  highly</span><span>  appreciated.  Mr.  Sandel  advocated  the  return</span><span>  of  Mr.  Bea  to  assist  Mr.  Paterson.  At  the</span><span>  conclusion  of  the  speaker's  remarks,  a  cordial</span><span>  vote  of  thanks  was  awarded  to  the  Chairman</span><span>  and  the  meeting  dispersed.</span></p> <p><span>  MESSRS.  MACFARLANE  and  Buzacott  ad-</span></p> <p><span>  dressed  a  large  meeting  of  thc  electors  last</span><span>  night  in  the  School  of  Arts,  the  Mayor  being</span><span>  called  to  the  chair.  Mr,  Macfarlane  prefaced</span><span>  his  remarks  by  referring  to  a  report  which</span><span>  hod  reached  him  that  he  hod  said  that  if  the</span><span>  electors  returned  himself  and  Mr.  Paterson</span><span>  he  (Mr.  Macfarlane)  would  not  take  his  seat.</span><span>  He  gave  this  report  thc  most  unqualified  con-</span><span>  tradiction.  Whoever  the  electors  chose</span><span>  along  with  himself  he  (Mr.  Macfarlane)</span><span>  would  work  with  him  ;  bnt  what  he  did  say</span><span>  was,  *'  If  you  roturo  mo  and  Mr.  Macdonald</span><span>  Paterson,  it  is  very  likely  we  will  sit  on</span><span>  opposite  «ides  of  the  House,  and  that  will  be</span><span>  a  pity.""  Thc  speaker  replied  to  thc  statement,</span><span>  the  changes  of  which  had  been  so  frequently  rung,</span><span>  that  thc  Central  district  had  got  so  much  from</span><span>  the  present  Ministry,  showing  that  there</span><span>  was  nothing  to  he  thankful  for  in  that  ;</span><span>  for  if  it  only  g«t  what  it  was  justly</span><span>  entitled  to,  where  was  the  cause  for  gratitude""</span><span>  -and  if  it  got  more  that  it  was  entitled  to</span><span>  roceive,  thc  .Ministry  hod  broken  the  law  which</span></p> <p><span>  they  vere  sworn  impartially  to  administer.</span><span>  If  Rockhampton  got  a  bridge,  so  also  did</span><span>  Brisbane,  Maryborough,  and  Mackay,  and</span><span>  whore  was  tho  reason  for  being  overcome  with</span><span>  gratitude  for  only  getting  what  could  not</span><span>  justly  bo  withheld  *  (Cheers.)  Tho  speaker</span><span>  took  Mr.  Paterson  to  task  for  his  statements,</span><span>  and  waa  amazed  at  the  number  of  things</span><span>  that  gentleman  had  done  for  the  town.</span><span>  Amidst  much  laughter,  he  rerorrei  wrlnthn</span><span>  to  thc  various  good  works  that  gentle-</span><span>  man  had  créditai  himself  with,  and</span><span>  after  all  that  was  said  about  the  bridge</span><span>  and  the  training  wall  and  thereat,  he  supped</span><span>  'Sn  end  of  it  would  be  that  they  ouah'  to</span><span>  thank  him  or  the  Ministry  for  the  river,</span><span>  (Laughter  and  applause.)  The  speaker  thou</span><span>  exposed  thoabsurd  attempt  to  set  class  against</span><span>  class  hy  running  down  Hie  squatters,  showing</span><span>  that  every  occupation  in  the  community  was</span><span>  necessary  for  tho  public  good,  and  that  if  one</span><span>  ineinbor  of  the  body  politic  suffered  ali  Buffered</span><span>  with  it.  After  alluding  to  thc  Kanakas,  hut</span><span>  reiterating  his  views  as  previously  expressed,</span><span>  he  concluded,  amidst  great  applause,  by</span><span>  trusting  that  tho  electors,  if  they  returned</span><span>  him,  w'vv  ""  nlso  return  Mr.  Charles  Hardie</span><span>  Buzacott,  i  thc  electors  knew  was  no</span><span>  ornamental  member  but  n  hard  worker</span></p> <p><span>  (cheers)-and  ii  so  they  would  both  pull</span><span>  together  in  forwarding  th;  best  interests  of</span><span>  the  constituency.  (Loud  applause.)  Mr.</span><span>  Buzacott  then  rose,  and  was  received  with</span><span>  cheers.  He  disproved  thc  assertion  that  they</span><span>  were  indebted,  os  stated  by  Mr.  T.  M.</span><span>  Paterson,  to  the  Ministry  for  £1,300,000  ap</span><span>  propriated  to  the  Central  railway,  the  fact</span><span>  being  that  Mr.  Palmer's  Government  having</span><span>  obtained  Parliamentary  sanction  for  carrying</span><span>  the  railway  to  the  Comet,  it  was  not  in  tho</span><span>  power  of  any  Ministry  to  prevent  its  construc-</span><span>  tion.  On  the  basis  of  Mr.  Paterson's  own</span></p> <p><span>  figures,  the  Liberal  Government  had  only</span><span>  voted  £300,000  to  tho  railway,  as  the</span><span>  Westwood-Comet  extension  cost  nearly</span><span>  £700,000,  and  Parliament  was  committed  to</span><span>  that  by  the  Palmer  Government,  and  tho</span><span>  balance  of  £300,000  was  voted  lieioie  the</span><span>  Liberal  Party  existed.  Ho  defended  Mr.</span><span>  Palmer's  policy  concerning  railways  at  u  time</span><span>  when  thc  colouy  could  not  borrow  money  for</span><span>  loss  than  7  per  cent,  and  when  railway</span><span>  materials  were  also  very  dear  ;  but  with</span><span>  thc  altered  circumstances  of  the  colony</span><span>  in  1872  Mr.  Palmer's  Government  borrowed  a</span><span>  a  million  and  a-half  sterling;  and  in  thc</span><span>  beginning  of  1874  the  same  Government  made</span><span>  his  Excellency,  at  the  opening  of  Parliament,</span></p> <p><span>  recommend  a  reduction  nf  taxation  in  con-</span></p> <p><span>  sequence  of  a  deficit  of  £5ß,000  having  been</span><span>  extinguished  and  replaced  by  a  surplus  of</span><span>  £240,000.  The  Macalister  Government  came</span><span>  into  power  immediately  afterwards,  and  were</span><span>  entitled  to  credit  for  carrying  out  Mr.  Palmer's</span><span>  recommendation  in  this  respect.  The  speaker</span><span>  referred  to  his  action  on  the  railway  reserves</span><span>  Act,  by  which  means  land  might  be  thrown</span><span>  open  to  selectors  ;  to  the  action  of  thc  Govern-</span><span>  ment  in  compelling  squatters  to  buy  land  they</span><span>  did  not  wish  to  purchase  ;  and  to  the  con-</span><span>  ditions  imposed  an  selectors,  which  lie  not  only</span><span>  thought  too  hard  but  which  the  Opposition</span><span>  had  endeavoured  to  mitigate.  The  speaker</span><span>  concluded  by  stating,  os  Mr.  Macfarlane  had</span><span>  done,  that,  if  elected,  he  would  work  cordially</span><span>  with  any  other  member  they  returned  with</span><span>  him;  but  he  hoped  they  would  return</span><span>  two  men  who  would  work  cordially</span><span>  together.  (Applause.)  He  believed  Mr.</span><span>  Macfarlane  concurred  with  him  in  not  desiring</span><span>  a  vote  of  confidence  that  night,-they  would</span><span>  leavo  that  for  to-inomuv.  (Laughter,  and</span><span>  continued  cheeriug.  )  lu  reply  to  Mr.  Sharples,</span><span>  Mr.  Macfarlane  promised  to  do  his  best  to  get</span><span>  proper  camping  reserves  for  carriers,  and  to</span><span>  get  them  each  put  in  charge  of  a  caretaker  to</span><span>  prevent  encroachment.  Mr.  Buzacott  also  pro-</span><span>  mised  his  influence  for  the  same  object.  On</span><span>  the  motion  of  Mr.  Macfarlane,  seoonded  by</span><span>  Mr.  Buzacott,  the  meeting  closed  with  a  vote</span><span>  of  thanks  to  the  Mayor  for  presiding.</span></p> ",Article,1878-11-15,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  AUGUST  30,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  draft  petition  for  the  extension  of</span><span>  the  Central  Railway  to  Gladstone  is  now</span><span>  before  the  public,  and  calls  for  a  passing</span></p> <p><span>  notice.</span></p> <p><span>  The  document  sets  forth  that  large</span><span>  sums  of  money  have  been  uselessly  spent</span><span>  in  attempts  to  deepen  the  Fitzroy,  and</span><span>  there  seems  to  be  no  prospect  of  any  real</span><span>  improvement  being  effected  in  the  river</span><span>  navigation,  it  is  therefore  asked  that</span><span>  no  further  expenditure  should  take  place</span><span>  in  the  river,  but  that  the  railway  should</span><span>  be  continued  to  Port  Curtis,  where  safe</span><span>  and  commodious  harbour  accommoda-</span><span>  tion  is  to  be  found  for  the  largest  vessels  ;</span><span>  and  ""  the  best  harbour  on  the  Queens-</span><span>  land  coast  would  thus  be  made  available</span><span>  for  the  use  and  advancement  of  the</span><span>  colony,  instead  of  remaining  almost  un-</span><span>  profitable.""  It  is  further  stated  that  the</span><span>  railway,  if  ""  brought  io  its  natura1  ter-</span><span>  mination  at  deep  water  in  a  secure  port,</span><span>  would  become  more  profitable,  and</span><span>  be  an  advantage  to  Rockhampton  and</span></p> <p><span>  the  immense  district  of  which  it  is  the</span><span>  centre,  as  well  as  to  the  colony  at  large.""</span><span>  We  cannot  but  be  touched  by  the  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  tender  solicitude  manifested  by  the</span><span>  authors  of  the  petition  for  the  welfare  of</span><span>  Rockhampton,  which  is  made  the  object</span><span>  of  their  peculiar  regard,  whilst  Gladstone,</span></p> <p><span>  in  which  they  are  assumed  to  be  more</span><span>  closely  interested,  is  not  even  mentioned,  &nbsp;</span><span>  and  has  evidently  no  place  in  their</span><span>  thoughts.  We  give  our  Gladstone</span><span>  friends  full  credit  for  their  patriotic  dis-</span><span>  interestedness,  and  freely  accept  their</span><span>  expressions  of  goodwill  in  the  spirit  in</span><span>  which  they  are  tendered.  We  cannot,</span><span>  however,  endorse  some  of  the  statements</span><span>  in  their  petition,  and  must  differ  from</span><span>  them  as  to  the  desirableness  of  the  pro-</span><span>  posed  railway  extension.</span></p> <p><span>  We  do  not  deny  that  much  money</span><span>  has  been  wasted  in  ""  so-called  improve-</span><span>  ments  ""  in  the  Fitzroy  River,  but  this  is</span><span>  no  proof  that  the  river  is  incapable  of</span><span>  being  deepened  at  a  moderate  cost  so  as</span><span>  to  meet  the  growing  requirements  of  the</span><span>  district.  It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that</span><span>  until  Mr.  Nisbet  took  the  work  in  hand,</span><span>  the  attempts  to  improve  the  river  were</span><span>  undertaken  without  competent  profes-</span><span>  sional  guidance,  and  carried  out  in  a</span><span>  desultory  manner  without  regard  to  the</span><span>  conditions  necessary  to  a  successful</span><span>  issue.  A  large  dredge  named  the</span><span>  Fitzroy  was  built  for  this  river,  but</span><span>  instead  of  being  devoted  to  its  intended</span><span>  work  it  was  sold  to  the  Government</span><span>  of  New  South  Wales,  and  the</span><span>  Bremer,  a  small  dredge  built  for  the</span><span>  Bremer  River,  was  sent  to  the</span><span>  Fitzroy  and  employed  for  a  year  or  two</span><span>  on  the  Upper  Flats,  although  totally</span><span>  unfit  for  dredging  in  a  large  river,  and</span><span>  the  work  was  conducted  in  such  a  way</span><span>  that  it  injured  rather  than  improved  the</span><span>  river  channel.  It  was  well  known,  how-</span><span>  ever,  that  dredging  alone  could  not</span><span>  effect  a  permanent  improvement;  and</span><span>  when  Mr.  Nisbet  took  charge  of  the</span><span>  work,  he  simply  employed  the  dredge</span><span>  for  a  time  in  order  to  give  temporary</span><span>  relief,  and  even  at  that  it  was  next  to</span><span>  useless,  being  too  small  for  the  purpose.</span></p> <p><span>  But  the  works  now  in  progress  are  of  a</span><span>  totally  different  character,  and  designed</span><span>  to  be  of  permanent  benefit.  In  the</span><span>  Fitzroy,  as  in  all  other  rivers,  the</span><span>  depth  is  regulated  by  the  width,</span><span>  and  where  the  river  spreads  out</span><span>  very  considerably  beyond  its  average</span><span>  width,the  water  is  inconveniently shallow.</span><span>  The  obvious  remedy  for  this  defect  is</span><span>  to  narrow  the  stream  and  so  increase</span><span>  the  scour,  thereby  preventing  the  deposit</span><span>  of  silt  and  the  formation  of  shoals.  This</span><span>  narrowing  of  the  stream  is  being  effected</span><span>  by  the  construction  of  dykes,  and  the</span><span>  engineer  is  confident  that  the  result  will</span><span>  be  satisfactory.  A  similar  plan  has,  we</span><span>  understand,  been  carried  out  in  the</span><span>  Mississippi  with  the  best  results.  The</span><span>  part  of  the  Fitzroy  most  in  need  of</span><span>  deepening  is  at  the  Upper  Flats,  and  it</span><span>  is  there  that  the  training  wall,  or  dyke,</span><span>  begins.  But  the  work  has  not  suf-</span><span>  ficiently  advanced  to  produce  any  very</span><span>  marked  effect  on  the  river  channel,  and</span><span>  it  was  never  expected  to  answer  without</span><span>  resort  to  dredging.  The  Engineer  of</span><span>  Harbours  distinctly  points  out  in  his</span><span>  report  of  October  last  year,  that  the</span><span>  training  wall  alone  would  not  be  suffi-</span><span>  cient,  but  that  once  the  channel  is  fixed</span><span>  in  a  definite  and  uniform  line,  the  depth</span><span>  may  be  increased  at  any  time  subse-</span><span>  quently  by  dredging.  He  also  states</span><span>  that  the  present  dredge  is  ""  thoroughly</span><span>  unsuitable  for  the  work,""  and  on  his</span><span>  recommendation  a  sum  is  down  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  Loan  Estimates  now  before  the  Legisla-</span><span>  tive  Assembly  for  the  procuring  of  a</span><span>  suitable  dredge.  The  statement  in  the</span><span>  Gladstone  manifesto,  that  there  seems  no</span><span>  prospect  of  any  real  improvement  being</span><span>  effected  in  the  river,  is  therefore rather pre-</span><span>  mature,  and  we  would  remind  our  Glad-</span><span>  stone  friends  of  a  certain  proverb  depre-</span><span>  cating  hasty  conclusions  on  the  merit</span><span>  of  work  only  half  done.</span></p> <p><span>  But  assuming,  for  argument's  sake,</span><span>  that  the  river  works  are  to  end  in</span><span>  failure,  is  that  a  sufficient  reason  for  con-</span><span>  tinuing  the  railway  to  Gladstone  ?  Port</span><span>  Curtis  is  undoubtedly  a  fine  harbour,  but</span><span>  Keppel  Bay  has  an  equally  safe  and</span><span>  commodious  anchorage,  and  there  are</span><span>  sites  on  the  banks  of  the  Fitzroy lowerdown</span><span>  than  Rockhampton,  suitable  for  wharfage</span><span>  for  large  vessels  and  approachable  in  ordi-</span><span>  nary  tides  in  the  present  state  of  the</span><span>  river.  There  is  Broadmount,  some</span><span>  twenty  miles  or  more  down  the  river  on</span><span>  the  Northside,  and  there  is  Central  Island</span><span>  Reach,  with  a  fine  bank  for  wharves,</span><span>  only  twelve  miles  down  on  the  south</span><span>  side,  at  which  place  vessels  of  the  size</span><span>  now  trading  between  this  port  and  Lon-</span><span>  don  can  come  without  difficulty,  and  lie</span><span>  safely  at  anchor  in  twenty-one  feet  at  low</span><span>  water  springs.  A  railway  connecting</span><span>  that  place  with  the  Rockhampton</span><span>  station  could  be  made  for  £40,000,</span><span>  with  wharf  and  goods  shed  included;</span><span>  and  the  distance  is  so  short  that</span><span>  all  the  direct  shipping  business  which  is</span><span>  likely  to  be  required  in  Central  Queens-</span><span>  land  for  some  years  to  come  at  least,</span><span>  could  be  conducted  there  by  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  firms,  without  the  aid  of  branch  stores</span><span>  which  would  occasion  needless  expense.</span></p> <p><span>  If,  however,  this  arrangement  is  not</span><span>  acceptable  to  our  Gladstone  friends,  we</span><span>  will  carry  our  argument  further,  and</span><span>  assume,  for  the  time  being,  that  all  ex-</span><span>  pedients  to  improve  the  Fitzroy  or</span><span>  provide  increased  facilities  in  it  for  the</span><span>  shipping  trade  of  the  district  are  doomed</span><span>  to  prove  abortive,----would  a  continuation</span><span>  of  the  railway  to  Gladstone,  even  in  that</span><span>  case,  be  a  desirable  undertaking ?</span><span>  Perhaps  the  best  way  of  answering  this</span><span>  question  will  be  to  consider  its  bearings</span><span>  from  an  £.  s.  d.  point  of  view.  The</span><span>  carriage  rates  by  rail  under  the  present</span><span>  tariff,  may  be  estimated  at  an  average</span><span>  of  £1  per  thirty  miles.  Setting  down</span><span>  the  additional  distance  to  port  by  rail  to</span><span>  Gladstone  at  seventy-five  miles,  this</span><span>  would  involve  an  extra  charge</span><span>  in  railway  carriage  of  50s.  on  every  ton</span><span>  of  produce  and  merchandise.  We  are</span><span>  merely  approximating  the  average  charge</span><span>  and  the  substantial  accuracy  of  0ur</span><span>  estimate  cannot  be  gainsaid.  With</span><span>  Gladstone  handicapped  by  an  additional</span><span>  burden  of  50s.  per  ton  on  land  carriage</span><span>  how  could  it  secure  the  shipping  trade</span><span>  of  the  district  ?  Freights  are  about  the</span><span>  same  by  intercolonial  vessels  trading  with</span><span>  Rockhampton  as  by  those  with  Gladstone</span><span>  and  the  50s.  additional  land  carriage</span><span>  would  certainly  be  prohibitory  to  the  use</span><span>  of  the  Gladstone  railway  and  port.  And</span><span>  with  regard  to  direct  ships,  any  consi-</span><span>  derable  increase  in  local  port  charges</span><span>  would  be  absolutely  prohibitory.  We</span></p> <p><span>  readily  admit  that  river  navigation  has</span><span>  its  disadvantages  and----in  the  present</span><span>  state  of  the  Fitzroy----its  delays  and</span><span>  attendant  losses.  But  what  are  these  in</span><span>  comparison  with  the  extra  charge  by  rail</span><span>  of  50s.  per  ton,  which  would  be  imposed</span><span>  on  goods  and  produce  passing  to  and</span><span>  from  the  shores  of  Port  Curtis,  as  com-</span><span>  pared  with  the  rates  to  and  from  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  ?  The  truth  is  that  the  Glad-</span><span>  stone  railway  would  be  a  useless  toy,</span><span>  and  a  criminal  waste  of  money  whilst</span><span>  railway  extension  inland  is  so  urgently</span><span>  needed,  and,  despite  the  railway,  trade</span><span>  would  continue  to  flow  in  its  present chan-</span><span>  nels.  The  Fitzroy  must,  in  fact,  be  en-</span><span>  tirely  blocked  up,  and all shipping excluded</span><span>  from  its  turbid  waters,  or  it  will  continue</span><span>  to  carry  the  trade,  whether  the  railway</span></p> <p><span>  be  extended  to  Gladstone  or  not.  But</span><span>  to  close  up  the  Fitzroy  would  be  a violent</span><span>  interference  with  Nature's  laws  such  as</span><span>  would  hardly  be  justifiable,  even  for  the</span><span>  laudable  object  of  conducting  the  trade</span><span>  of  the  district  to  its  ""  natural  port.""</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court,  yesterday,  no  cases  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  were  brought  before  the  Police  Magistrate  for</span><span>  hearing.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Committee  of  thc  Fitzroy  Rowing  &nbsp;</span><span>  Club  meet  this  evening,  at  the  Oxford  Arms</span></p> <p><span>  Hotel.----A  parade  of  L  Company  takes  place  &nbsp;</span><span>  to-night.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  usual  meeting  of  the  Fitzroy  Lodge  of</span><span>  Good  Templars  will  be  held  this  evening  in</span><span>  the  Oddfellows'  New  Hall,  Denham-street,</span><span>  instead  of  the  Protestant  Hall.

A  telegram  was  some  time  ago</span><span>  received  to  that  effect,  but  it  does  not  appear</span><span>  that  the  time  of  the  sale  at  Cometville  has</span><span>  been  yet  announced.  No  doubt  the  change</span><span>  will  be  satisfactory  to  the  Cometvillians.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  IT  has  long  beeu  known  that  silver  exists in</span><span>  this  district,  the  metal  having  been  frequently</span><span>  found.  Within  the  past  few  days  a  man</span><span>  named  Wolff  has  brought  into  town  some</span><span>  specimens  of  stone  in  which  the  silver  is</span><span>  richly  embedded.  His  object  is  to  get  the</span><span>  ore  assayed  with  view  of  ascertaining  whether</span><span>  it  would  be  profitable  for  him  to  select  the</span><span>  ground  where  it  was  discovered.  As  may  be</span><span>  supposed  he  keeps  the  exact  locality  a  secret,</span></p> <p><span>  but  it  is  known  that  it  was  obtained  within  a</span></p> <p><span>  few  miles  of  Rosewood.  Further  particulars</span><span>  will  be  looked  forward  to  with  interest.</span></p> <p><span>  ON  Tuesday  last  a  skeleton  was  found  by</span><span>  Mr.  W.  Giles  ou  the  North  side  of  the</span><span>  Fitzroy  River,  near  Central  Island.  A  flannel</span><span>  shirt  of  a  check  pattern  partly  covered  the</span><span>  bones,  and  Cossack  boots  without  rivets  and</span><span>  cotton  socks  were  on  the  feet.  Mr.  Giles</span><span>  brought  the  skull  to  town,  and  it  is  now  in  the</span><span>  Police  Office.  It  appears  to  be  the  skull  of  a</span><span>  white  man.  Two  policemen,  accompanied  by</span><span>  Mr.  Giles,  were  to  proceed  down  the  river</span><span>  last  night,  to  bury  the  remains,  and  institute</span><span>  inquiries  with  a  view  to  their  identification.</span><span>  The  shirt  and  boots  point  to  the  conclusion</span><span>  that  the  skeleton  is  that  of  John  Stack,  who</span><span>  was  missed  from  the  steamer  Vyking  between</span><span>  twelve  and  three  o'clock  on  the  morning  of</span><span>  Suuday,  April  7,  on  her  way  to  Gladstone.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  learn  that  the  extension  of  the  railway</span><span>  beyond  the  Comet  is  proceeding  satisfactorily.</span><span>  ALL  the  heavy  earth  cuttings  for  the  first  ten</span><span>  miles  have  been  made,  and  the  embankments</span><span>  ara  in  a  forward  state.  The  bridge  over  the</span><span>  Nogoa  is  being  proceeded  with,  and  will  be</span><span>  ready  for  the  rails  when  the  line  comes  up  to</span><span>  it.  The  first  five  miles  of  way  beyond  the</span><span>  Comet  is  the  most  difficult,  after  which  till</span><span>  the  Nogoa  there  is  nice  level  country,  over</span><span>  which  the  rails  will  be  laid  apace.  The  per-</span><span>  manent  way  is  laid  for  a  mile  and  a  half</span><span>  beyond  the  Comet,  and  within  five  months  it</span><span>  is  probable  that  a  considerable  length  will  be</span><span>  completed  if  the  rails  are  forthcoming.  There</span><span>  is  also  a  considerable  amount  of  work  being</span><span>  done  in  making  dams  on  this  side  of  the</span><span>  Nogoa,  which  will  afford  an  ample  supply  of</span></p> <p><span>  water  when  the  first  rain  comes.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  District  Court  sittings  were  resumed</span><span>  yesterday  morning  at  the  usual  hour,  and  the</span><span>  further  hearing  of  the  case  T.  Kearney  v.</span><span>  Ahearn  and  Swadling  proceeded  with,  and</span><span>  concluded  at  one  o'clock.  At  that  hour  the</span></p> <p><span>  jury  retired,  and  intimating  an  hour  later  that  &nbsp;</span><span>  they  were  unable  to  come  to  a  decision</span><span>  they  were  sent  back,  his  Honor  not  having</span><span>  the  power  to  discharge  them  according</span><span>  to  the  Act  until  they  had  been  confined  for</span><span>  the  minimum  period  of  six  hours.  At  five</span><span>  o'clock,  the  jury  still  disagreeing,  his  Honor</span><span>  said  he  would  take  the  responsibility  of  dis-</span><span>  claiming  them,  and  they  were  accordingly</span><span>  discharged.  An  application,  on  behalf  of  the</span><span>  plaintiff,  in  the  case  of  G.  H.  May  v.  Mac-</span><span>  dermott  Brothers  for  an  adjournment  of  the</span><span>  trial,  owing  to  the  absence  of  Mr.  Ramsay  of</span><span>  Maryborough,  a  material  witness,  was  granted</span><span>  upon  payment  of  costs.  A  verdict  of  £10  was</span><span>  given  in  favour  of  James  Boyce,  who  sued  the</span><span>  Municipal  Council  for  £19  10s.,  the  value  of</span><span>  a  bull  drowned  off  the  punt.  The proceedings</span><span>  in  this  case  were  somewhat  enlivened  by  the</span><span>  comments  made  by  his  Honor  and  the  legal</span><span>  profession  upon  the  evidence  regarding  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  age  of  the  animal  and  its  value  for  herd  &nbsp;</span><span>  purposes.  The  last  case  of  the  day  resulted  &nbsp;</span><span>  in  Charles  MCabe  obtaining  a  verdict  of  £7  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  2s.  6d.  for  services  rendered  to  John  Cramp.  &nbsp;</span><span>  The  Court  adjourned  at  five  o'clock  until  ten  &nbsp;</span><span>  this  morning.  There  are  six  causes  on  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  list  for  hearing,  in  addition  to  an  appeal  case.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  THE  DIAMANTINA.---Waggons  starting  from  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  this  port  to  the  vast  newly  occupied  country  &nbsp;</span><span>  in  the  far  west  will  be  soon  so  common  as  to  &nbsp;</span><span>  attract  no  more  notice  than  ?  going  to  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  neighbouring  stations.  Mr.  Synett  has  just  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  started  nine  teams,  carrying  a  large  stock  of</span></p> <p><span>  merchandise,  galvanized  iron,  etc.,  with  a  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  view  to  forming  a  store  near  ?

Some</span><span>  of  the  men  are  getting  from  one  to  one  and  a</span><span>  half  ozs.  a  week,  and  some  are  getting  much</span><span>  more.  A  great  deal  of  the  gold  is  got  by</span><span>  sluicing  in  the  bed  of  the  river,  the  course  of</span></p> <p><span>  which  has  to  bo  changed  for  the  purpose,  as</span><span>  there  is  plenty  of  water  in  it.  Our  informant</span><span>  states  that  the  country  being  worked  is  not  of</span><span>  any  extent,  and  gives  it  as  his  opinion  that</span><span>  it  will  support  about  150  men  for  some  time.</span><span>  At  first  the  prospects  of  the  field  were dis-</span><span>  couraging,  but  after  working  some  time  it  was</span><span>  found  to  be  better,  and  many,  the  packers  in</span><span>  particular,  would  have  done  well  by  giving  it</span><span>  a  fair  trial.  The  prospectors,  our  informant</span><span>  believes,  did  not  properly  prospect  any  part  of</span><span>  the  country  but  a  spot  where  the  present</span><span>  field  is  situated,  as  there  were  good  indica-</span><span>  tions  that  they  had  done  a  lot  of  work  there.</span><span>  When  our  informant  left  flour  was  selling  at</span><span>  30s.  a  50lb.  bag,  and  meat  at  6d.  per  pound,</span><span>  but  the  latter  was  likely  to  rise.  He  came</span><span>  into  town  to  pack  up  goods,  and  brought  down</span><span>  several  orders  from  persons  on  the  field  for</span><span>  supplies.

The</span><span>  person  who  christened  this  part  of  the  country</span><span>  a  desert  could  never  have  tried  to  grow  vege-</span><span>  tables  on  it,  for  at  thc  present  time  Mr.</span><span>  Springer,  of  thc  Speculation  Hotel,  has  a  mag-</span><span>  nificent  variety  of  all  kinds  of  what  a  Yankee</span><span>  would  call  ""garden  sass,""  and  I  have  heard</span><span>  from  good  authority  that  a  cauliflower  cut  at</span><span>  Greentree  last  Sunday  turned  thc  scale  at</span><span>  seven  pounds-not  so  bad  for  a  desert.

One</span><span>  smelted,  150  tons;  coarse  copper  produced,</span><span>  13J  tons;  metal  in  a  forward  state,  equal  to</span><span>  14  tons  copper.  Thc  ore  smelted  averaged</span><span>  10.J,  per  cent.  Tho  quantity  of  wood  delivered</span><span>  during  the  week  was  35'2  tonB"",  consumed,</span><span>  43S  tonB  ;  leaving  on  hand,  340  tons.  Thc</span><span>  refinery  is  again  at  work,  and  was  expected  to</span><span>  turn  out  0  tons  on  Monday  night,  and  there  is</span><span>  sufficient  copper  to  keep  going  during  thc</span></p> <p><span>  week.  Two  furnaces  will  have  to  be  let  out</span><span>  now  that  the  refinery  is  working,  as  there  is</span><span>  not  a  sufficient  number  of  smelters  to  keep  thc</span><span>  whole  going.  Four  men  have  boen  employed</span><span>  clearing  ana  securing  thc  20-fathom  level,  at</span><span>  Pearce's  Shaft.  It  will  take  Borne  days  to</span><span>  complete  securing  thc  level,  which  is  in  very</span><span>  bad  repair.  The  lode  in  the  bottom  is  from</span><span>  eighteen  iuchcB  to  two  feet  thick,  of  good</span><span>  black  ore  of  about  J4  percent.

J).  Telegram)  readers  will  be  pleased  to</span><span>  learn  that  thc  survey  of  a  road  from  Emerald</span><span>  Downs  to  Clermont  is  nearly  finished.  Two</span><span>  lines  have  been  run,  thc  one  via  Capella,  and</span><span>  thc  other,  or  western  route,  via  Llandillo  and</span><span>  Retreat  stations.  The  former,  or  shorter</span><span>  route,  jiasses  through  scrubby  country  nearly</span><span>  the  whole  way,  there  being  only  one  patch  of</span><span>  gross  of  any  extent.  Tho  latter,  or  western</span><span>  route,  which  is  a  few  miles  longer  than  the</span><span>  other,  avoids  thc  larger  scrubs,  and  passes</span><span>  through  better  country,  where  grass  is  pro-</span><span>  curable.  There  is  water  on  both  lines.  The</span></p> <p><span>  question  ot  route  is  not  decided,  as  the  sur-</span><span>  vey  must  first  be  completed  ;  but  it  is  just</span><span>  possible  that  wc  may  find  herc  an  exempli-</span><span>  fication  of  on  old  saying,  ""  The  longest  way</span><span>  round  IB  thc  shortest  way  home.""  An  abun-</span><span>  dance  of  grass  will  go  far  towards  compen-</span><span>  sating  for  a  few  additional  miles  of  road.  Tho</span><span>  absolutely  shortest  route,  as  thc  crow  flies,</span><span>  would  bc  an  intermediate  line,  running</span><span>  through  dense  scrub  ;  but  on  this  route  team-</span><span>  sters  would  bc  compelled  to  feed  all  tho  year</span><span>  round.  It  was  for  the  making  of  a  road  from</span><span>  Clermont  to  Emerald  Downs  tbat  Mr.  Steven-</span><span>  son  secured  a  vote  of  £1500  thc  other  day,</span><span>  and  thc  Roads  Department  arc  losing  no  time</span><span>  in  pushing  ahead.  It  is  intended,  wc  believe,</span><span>  to  have  this  road,  as  well  as  the  new  road</span><span>  from  Blackall,  ready  for  traffic  by  March</span><span>  next,  when,  if  no  unforeseen  obstacles  should</span><span>  arise,  thc  railway  will  bc  opened  to  Emerald</span><span>  Downs.  As  regards  thc  Blackall  road,  we</span></p> <p><span>  hear  that  it  is  finished  as  far  os  Aumuller's</span></p> <p><span>  Gap,  and  that  it  will  shortly  be  opened  for</span><span>  trallic  at  that  point.  Its  completion  to</span><span>  Emerald  Downs  is  not  likely  to  exceed  the</span><span>  limit  mentioned.</span></p> <p><span>  TnE  MIKE  OS  FIDE.-Just  before  six</span><span>  o'clock  on  Wednesday  morning  (say  last</span><span>  Saturday's  Advoca!*)  it  was  discovered  that</span><span>  one  of  tho  shafts  on  the  Company's  property,</span><span>  known  as  Crabb's  Shaft,  a  little  to  the  north</span><span>  of  the  refinery,  was  on  fire,  through  what</span><span>  agency,  however,  was  at  the  time  unknown,</span><span>  os  only  one  shift  is  worked  at  the  present</span><span>  time.  The  flames  were  roaring  like  a  furnace</span><span>  from  the  mouth  of  thc  shaft,  and  so  fierce</span><span>  that  the  framework  for  thc  giu,  which  stood</span><span>  at  a  considorablc  height,  was  partially  con-</span><span>  sumed.  The  alarm-bell  was  at  once  rung,  and,</span><span>  although  many  did  not  hurry,  thinking  it  was</span><span>  the  ordinary  seven-o'clock  bell,  a  considerable</span><span>  number  had  collected  in  a  short  time.  The</span><span>  first  thing  to  be  done  was  to  close  the  aperture</span><span>  underground  and  block  up  the  mouth  of  the</span><span>  shaft,  so  as  to  stifle  the  flames,  which  had</span><span>  been  gaining  strength  from  the  draught</span><span>  beneath,  and  rapidly  consuming  thc  sulphur</span><span>  impregnated  timber  work.  This  shaft,  it  may</span><span>  be  stated,  communicates  with  many  others,</span><span>  allowing  the  free  passage  of  air,  so  that,  unless</span><span>  all  apertures  were  closed,  it  would  have</span></p> <p><span>  formed  an  excellent  flue  to  enable  the  fire  to</span></p> <p><span>  destroy  thu  whole  of  the  timber  throughout</span><span>  an  extensive  and  important  portion  of  thc</span><span>  mine.  Conjecture  was  rife  os  to  the  cause  of</span><span>  the  subterranean  conflagration.  It  was  the</span><span>  general  opinion  that  tho  lightning,  conducted</span><span>  by  thc  wire  rope  which  cummunicatcs  with</span><span>  thc  engine,  had  entered  thc  shaft  and  set  the</span><span>  timber  on  fire.  Another  conjecture  was  that</span><span>  some  careless  workmen  had  left  a  piece  of</span><span>  candle  burning  on  some  projection  of  the</span><span>  timber  thc  evening  before,  which,  having</span><span>  burnt  almost  out,  had  ignited  a  dry  slab  or</span><span>  something  of  the  sort.  The  matter  will  be</span><span>  fully  investigated,  and  officially  reported</span></p> <p><span>  upou.</span></p> <p><span>  ELECTION""  GOSSIP.-As  a  matter  of  course  a</span><span>  vast  deal  of  rumour  and  gossip,  the  Courier</span><span>  observes,  is  already  in  circulation  about  the</span><span>  coming  elections,  and  it  would  not  bc  difficult</span><span>  to  fill  a  column  with  fact  and  fancy  thcreanent</span><span>  -fancy  mostly.  For  a  fact,  however,  Mr.  A.</span><span>  J.  Hookinga  ÍB  in  the  field  for  Brisbane,  as  his</span><span>  address  in  our  columns  will  show.

In  Enoggera,  canvassers  are</span><span>  busy  for  Mr.  H.  H.  Payne,  Mr.  Hutledge,  and</span><span>  Mr.  Wettenhall.  Everybody  feels  so  sure  of</span><span>  Mr.  Dickson's  return  for  that  electorate  that</span><span>  nobody  seems  to  think  it  necessary  to  work</span><span>  for  him.  This  feeling  «if  security  may  he</span><span>  carried  too  far.  It  would  bc  a  pity  that  Mr.</span><span>  Dickson  should  not  bc  returned  to  the  ucxt</span></p> <p><span>  Parliament,  and  thc  electors  of  Enoggera  espe-</span><span>  cially  would  gixiatly  regret  such  a  mischance.</span><span>  But  if,  as  wo  iiear,  a  number  of  the  electors</span><span>  will  lie  governed  in  their  voting  by  certain</span><span>  ""isms,""  and  mean  to  plump  for  their  man,</span><span>  then  Mr.  Dickson's  friends  will  have  to  look</span></p> <p><span>  sharp.

They</span><span>  were  kind  enough  to  Bay  they  parted  from</span><span>  him  with  regret.  He  assured  them  the  regret</span><span>  was  mutual.

Mr.  Hurley</span><span>  has  two  months  for  consideration,  and  to</span><span>  assist  bim  in  determining  his  future  course,</span><span>  has  submitted  an  offer  to  the  Government  for</span><span>  the  construction  of  a  railway  from  Mary-</span><span>  borough  to  the  Burrum,  which  (tho  Clironicle.</span><span>  understands)  the  Ministry  arc  disposed  to</span><span>  accept.  The  terms,  roughly  stated,  are-a</span><span>  free  grant  of  the  land  wide  enough  to  carry</span><span>  the  railway  and  a  bonus  of  £5000  ;  at  the  end</span><span>  of  twenty-one  years,  the  Government  to  have</span><span>  thc  option  of  purchasing  the  line  at  a  valua-</span><span>  tion.  The  work  is  to  be  of  similar  construc-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  to  thc  line  now  ticing  made.  Mr.</span><span>  Hurley's  intention  is  to  carry  the  railway  to</span><span>  deep  water.</span></p> <p><span>  PEAK  DOWNS  TRAMWAY.-The  Directors  of</span><span>  the  New  Peak  Downs  Copper  Mining  Com-</span><span>  pany  have  advertised,  (says  the  Copperfield</span><span>  Advocate)  in  the  southern  papers  for  a  com-</span><span>  petent  Civil  Engineer  to  conduct  the  survey</span><span>  and  construction  of  the  tramway  to  the</span><span>  thickly  wooded  country.  They  are  also</span><span>  in  correspondence  with  several  gentlemen</span><span>  noted  for  their  knowledge  of  the  best  system</span><span>  and  means  of  constructing  tramways,  aud  from</span><span>  two  of  them  have  received  long  letters  con-</span><span>  taining  very  full  information.  As  yet  it  has</span><span>  not  been  decided  what  direction  thc  line  is  to</span><span>  take,  but  thc  general  opinion  appears  to  be</span><span>  that  towards  thc  Western  Mine  would  the</span></p> <p><span>  most  suitable,  inasmuch  as  it  would  go  through</span><span>  thickly  timbered  country,  and  would  facilitate</span><span>  the  bringing  iu  of  ores  from  thc  Western</span><span>  Mine  to  the  furnaces  ;  whilst  it  would  also  be</span><span>  thc  direction  in  which  the  line  would  run  for</span><span>  some  miles  should  it  ever  be  thought  ex-</span><span>  pedient  to  extend  it  to  the  Company's  coal</span><span>  selection.  Until  fuller  information  is  ob-</span><span>  tained  respecting  thc  cost  of  steel  rails</span><span>  landed  here,  it  has  not  lieen  determined</span><span>  whether  the  line  shall  lie  of  steel  or  wood.</span><span>  The  steel  would  be  in  many  ways  peeferable</span><span>  no  doubt,  but  consideration  must  be  had  for</span><span>  the  cost.  It  is  thought  that  to  lay  the  line</span><span>  with  wooden  rails  would  cost  about  £500  per</span><span>  mile,  and  with  steel  probably  i""S00  tn  £900.</span><span>  If  it  can  be  made  for  £500  n  mile,  the</span><span>  Directors  calculate  they  can  pay  for  the  con-</span><span>  struction  of  a  mile  a  month,  which  would  be</span><span>  the  distance  that  could  bo  got  over  in  that</span><span>  time.  There  will  be  probably  no  difficulty  in</span><span>  obtaining  the  consent  of  the  Government  to</span><span>  running  the  line  through  Crowu  landa.  A</span><span>  clause  in  the  Mineral  l^auds  Act  provides</span><span>  that  the  Governor  in  Council  may  sanction</span><span>  such  provided  it  can  be  shown  to  be  for  the</span><span>  benefit  of  the  community;  and  there  will  bc</span></p> <p><span>  not  the  «lightest  difficulty  in  proving  that  it</span><span>  is  of  paramount  importance  to  this  district</span><span>  that  the  tramway  should  be  constructed.</span></p> <p><span>  SUNDRY  ITEMS.-Wc  gather  the  following</span><span>  items  of  news  from  the  Wide  Bay  iieuw  :</span><span>  Mr.  J.

The  property  in</span><span>  question  was  a  cottage  on  the  Range,</span><span>  lately  in  the  occupation  of  Mr.  Mackay,</span><span>  who,  on  giving  up  possession,  paid  into</span><span>  the  office  of  the  Town  Clerk  ten</span><span>  shillings,  the  amount  of  thc  rate  which</span><span>  had  accrued  to  that  date,  leaving  the</span><span>  balance  to  be  paid  by  the  landlord  or</span><span>  by  the  next  incoming  tenant.  The</span><span>  matter  having  been  referred  to  the</span><span>  Town  Solicitor,  who  was  in  attendance  by</span><span>  the  request  of  the  Mayor  to  watch  the</span><span>  proceedings  and  to.  advise  the  Court  on</span><span>  any  points  of  difficulty  that  might  arise,</span><span>  that  officer  gave  it  as  his  opinion  that</span><span>  the  name  had  been  illegally  omitted,</span><span>  and  should  be  placed  on  the  roll,  support-</span><span>  ing  his  view  by  apparently  cogent  argu-</span><span>  ments  which,  if  sound,  have  a  bearing</span><span>  of  wider  import  than  was  involved  in  the</span><span>  merits  of  this  particular  claim.</span></p> <p><span>  It  will  be  understood  that  under  the</span><span>  old  law  it  was  the  practice  to  allow  both</span><span>  landlord  and  tenant  to  vote  on  the  same</span><span>  property  :  and  we  believe  the  legality  of</span></p> <p><span>  this  practice  was  never  called  in  ques-</span><span>  tion.  The  Act  stated  that  all  persons</span><span>  liable  to  be  rated  were  entitled  to  vote.</span><span>  The  tenant,  as  a  rule,  was  called  upon</span><span>  to  pay  the  rates,  but  in  certain  cases  the</span><span>  landlords  preferred  to  pay,  an  induce-</span><span>  ment  for  their  doing  so  being  that  they</span><span>  ensured  their  right  to  vote  at  the  municipal</span><span>  elections  by  taking  care  that  they  were</span><span>  not  disqualified  by  the  rates  on  any  one</span><span>  of  their  properties  being  unpaid  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  time  of  an  election.  The  law  thus  \</span><span>  interpreted,  had  both  advantages  and</span><span>  disadvantages.  It  secured  the  prompt</span><span>  payment  of  rates  in  some  cases  where</span><span>  otherwise  the  issue  of  a  warrant  with  its</span><span>  attendant  delays  and  annoyances  would</span></p> <p><span>  have  been  necessary,  and  sometimes  it  ¡</span><span>  augmented  the  voling  power  of  the  pro-</span><span>  perty  owner  ;  but  it  was  not  unattended</span><span>  by  inconvenience  and  hardship,  for  it</span><span>  interfered  with  the  relations  between</span><span>  landlord  and  tenant,  and  the  former  was</span><span>  always  liable  to  be  disfranchised  unless</span><span>  he  paid  the  rates  himself  and  trusted  to</span><span>  the  chances  of  recovering  them  from  the</span><span>  tenant.  As  the  law  was  interpreted,  a</span><span>  man  might  own  fifty  properties  in  a  par-</span><span>  ticular  ward  or  municipality,  but  if  the</span><span>  rates  were  unpaid  in  any  one  instance,</span><span>  perhaps  for  an  amount  not  exceeding  ten</span><span>  shillings,  he  was  precluded  from  voting</span><span>  at  any  election  for  such  ward  or  munici-</span><span>  pality.  The  Act  was  vague,  and  might</span></p> <p><span>  j  very  possibly  have  been  found  capable</span></p> <p><span>  of  a  different  construction  had  a  case  in</span><span>  point  been  taken  before  the  Supreme</span><span>  Court  ;  but  we  are  only  speaking  of  the</span><span>  old  law  as  it  was  interpreted  and  acted</span></p> <p><span>  upon.</span></p> <p><span>  un  a  cursory  examination  of  the  new</span><span>  Act,  there  ifould  seem  to  be  no  material</span><span>  alteration  in  this  respect.  Section  49</span><span>  enacts  that  ""  every  persou,  whether  male</span><span>  cr  female-(the  extension  of  the  munici-</span><span>  pal  franchise  to  females  is  a  novelty  in</span><span>  this  colony)-of  the  full  age  of  twenty-one</span><span>  years,  who,  on  the  ist  day  in  Novem-</span><span>  ber  in  any  year,  is  liable  to  bc  rntcd  in</span><span>  respect  of  any  property  within  any  muni-</span><span>  cipal  district,  and  who  shall  have  paid</span><span>  all  sums  then  payable  in  respect  of  any</span></p> <p><span>  rates  made  three  months  or  more  before</span></p> <p><span>  suchday.shallbecntitled  tobe  enrolled  on</span><span>  the  voters'  roll  forsuch  district,""&:c.  This</span><span>  would  seem  to  be  substantially  in  agree-</span><span>  ment  with  the  voter's  qualifications  under</span><span>  the  law  as  it  was.  However,  the  Local</span><span>  Government  Act,  which  is  now  in  force,</span><span>  is  more  explicit  on  this  subject,  and</span></p> <p><span>  appears  to  modify  and  alter  the</span><span>  municipal  franchise  in  some  important</span><span>  respects.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  first  place,  it  leaves  no  room</span><span>  for  doubt  as  regards  who  is  liable  to  pay</span><span>  rates.  The  J  90th  section  enacts  that</span><span>  every  rate  shall  be  levied  by  the  Council</span><span>  upon  every  occupier  ;  or,  if  there  he  no</span><span>  occupier,  then  upon  the  owner.  And</span><span>  by  the  184th  section,  it  is  required  that</span><span>  notice  of  valuation,  and  of  trie  amount</span><span>  thereof,  shall  be  given  to  every  occupier</span><span>  of  rateable  property,  or,  if  their  be  no</span><span>  occupier,  then  to  the  owner.  It  is</span><span>  further  provided  by  the  205th  section</span><span>  and  this  is  deserving  of  special  attention</span><span>  -that  when  the  occupier  is  ruted,  and</span><span>  the  rate  remains  unpaid  for  three</span><span>  months,  the  Council  may  at  any  time</span><span>  within  twelve  months  after  the  making</span><span>  of  the  rate,  demand  the  amount  of  such</span><span>  rate,  or  any  part  thereof,  from  the</span><span>  owner  ;  and  on  non-payment  thereof</span><span>  after  one  month's  service  of  such  notice,</span><span>  enforce  payment.</span></p> <p><span>  In  Captain  Hunter's  case,  the  tenant</span><span>  was  rated,  and  a  month's  notice  was  not</span></p> <p><span>  given  to  him  (Captain  Hunter)  ;  conse-  |</span><span>  quently  he  had  no  rate  in  arrear,  having  :</span><span>  paid  all  other  rates.  This  is  Mr.  Jones'</span><span>  contention.  The  landlord  is  certainly</span><span>  liable  to  pay  rates  on  his  property,  but</span><span>  only  in  a  contingent  sense,  unless  notice</span><span>  has  been  given  him  in  terms  of  the</span><span>  205th  section,  in  which  event  he  becomes</span><span>  directly  liable.  Captain  Humer  not</span><span>  having  received  notice  to  pay  the  rate,</span><span>  up  to  the  ist  November,  the  date  from</span><span>  which  the  compilation  of  the  voters'  lists</span><span>  had  to  be  made,  he  was  not,  it  is  argued,</span><span>  at  that  time  liable,  within  the  meaning  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  Act.</span></p> <p><span>  In  accordance  with  the  spirit  of  the</span><span>  205th  section,  hy  which  the  owner  is</span><span>  made  liable,  in  case  of  the  default  of</span><span>  the  occupier,  and  after  due  notice  being</span><span>  given  by  the  council  or  their  col-</span><span>  lector,  of  such  liability,  the  next</span><span>  following  section  (206th)  provides  that</span><span>  rates  due  from  an  owner  may  be  recovered</span><span>  from  the  occupier.  The  owner  would</span><span>  be  rated  in  the  event  of  his  property</span><span>  being  unoccupied  at  the  lime  that  a  rate</span><span>  was  levied;  but  supposing  a  tenant</span><span>  comes  in  before  the  rate  is  paid,  and</span><span>  it  has  remained  unpaid  for  three</span><span>  months,  the  council  or  their  collector</span><span>  _may~at-any-tim<""  within  twpJvp  months</span><span>  '  after  the  making  of  the  rate,  dep»'«!</span></p> <p><span>  the  amount  jaf^ud«-rater""  or  say</span><span>  '  ""pan-mei  euiîrom  the  occupier</span></p> <p><span>  for  the  time  being,  and  after  the  lapse</span><span>  of  one  month's  notice  may  enforce  pay-</span><span>  ment.  And  the  occupier  in  such  cases</span><span>  is  protected  by  a  proviso  which  entitles</span><span>  him,  subject  to  any  agreement  to  the</span><span>  contrary,  to  deduct  from  any  rent</span><span>  payable  by  him  to  the  owner,  so  much</span><span>  as  was  so  paid  by  or  recovered  from  him</span><span>  in  rates.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  also  another  useful  provision</span><span>  helping  to  define  the  respective  liabilities,</span><span>  of  owner  and  occupier,  and  as  between</span><span>  one  owner  and  another.  Section  204</span><span>  enacts  that  when  the  occupier  or</span><span>  owner  who  is  rated  to  any  rate,</span><span>  ceases  to  be  the  occupier  or</span><span>  owner  of  the  property  in  respect</span></p> <p><span>  whereof  he  is  rated,  before  tho  end  of</span><span>  of  the  period  in  respect  of  which  such</span><span>  rate  was  made,  such  occupier  or  owner</span><span>  6hall  be  liable  to  pay  a  portion  only  of</span><span>  the  rate  payable  for  the  whole  of  such</span><span>  period,  proportionate  to  the  time  during</span><span>  which  lie  continued  to  be  the  occupier,</span><span>  or  owner;  and  the  new  occupier  or</span></p> <p><span>  owner  becomes  liable  for  the  remainder</span></p> <p><span>  of  Hie  rate.  This  will  be  a  great  conveni-</span><span>  ence  in  adjusting  the  liability  as  between</span><span>  landlords  and  tenants,  and  between  one</span><span>  owner  and  another  in  case  of  a  transfer</span></p> <p><span>  of  a  property  ;  but  it  will  call  for  extra</span><span>  vigilance  on  thc  part  of  municipal  officers</span><span>  to  see  thal  each  person  discharges  his</span><span>  own  share  of  liability,  or  loss  will  ensue</span><span>  to  the  municipal  revenue,  and  the  new</span><span>  stipulations  will  also  involve  a  consider-</span><span>  able  increase  of  clerical  work.</span></p> <p><span>  Accepting  the  Town  Solicitor's  read-</span><span>  ing  of  the  Act-and  we  have  attentively</span></p> <p><span>  examined  for  ourselves  the  various</span><span>  sections  upon  which  he  bases  his  con-</span><span>  clusions-we  think  the  changes  made  in</span><span>  the  law  on  this  subject  must  be  con-</span><span>  sidered,  taken  as  a  whole,  to  be  a  de-</span><span>  cided  improvement.

It  is  with  very  great  satisfaction  that</span><span>  we  (Cooktown  Courier)  welcome  the  steamer</span><span>  Pacific  in  this  port,  as  we  believe  her  arrival</span><span>  here  will  be  the  means  of  opening  up  a  very</span><span>  advantageous  trade  with  Cooktown.  Thc</span><span>  Pacific  is  a  new  screw  steamer,  recently  built</span><span>  at  Hongkong,  specially  for  the  island  trade.</span><span>  She  is  faithfully  and  strongly  built,  her</span><span>  engines  are  manufactured  on  the  latest  ap-</span><span>  proved  principles,  and  she  commands  a  speed</span></p> <p><span>  equal  to  ten  knots  an  hour,  either  under  steam</span></p> <p><span>  or  canvas.  Her  net  register  tonnage  is  69.</span><span>  The  owners  are  Messrs.  Hernsheim  and  Co.,</span><span>  who  do  a  large  trade  in  copra  and  other  South</span><span>  Sea  products,  and  have  stations  on  the</span><span>  Marshall,  Caroline,  Duke  of  York,  New</span><span>  Britain,  and  New  Ireland  Islands.  In  all  the</span><span>  stations  number  twenty-five,  and  the  owners</span><span>  possess  in  addition  to  the  Pacific  four  large</span><span>  schooners.  The  copra  is  sent  direct  to  Europe</span><span>  by  vessels  chartercd  at  Sydney  and  Hongkong,</span><span>  leaving  coal  or  trade  at  the  various  islands,</span><span>  and  returning  from  thence  with  a  cargo  of</span><span>  produce.  The  Pacific  was  induced  to  call  into</span><span>  this  port  in  order  to  obtain  supplies,  and  also</span><span>  as  the  nearest  place  from  whence  ber  owners</span><span>  could  communicate  by  wire  with  their  friends</span><span>  in  Hamburg.  The  Duke  of  York  Island,</span><span>  from  whence  the  Pacific  took  her  departure</span><span>  for  Cooktown,  is  only  distant  about  five  days'</span></p> <p><span>  sail  from  here.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  LITE  Mn.

Here  isa</span></p> <p><span>  sample  from  thc  Freeman'*  Journal  :-Half</span><span>  thc  error  of  Mr.  Justice  Keogh's  unhappy</span><span>  career  may  be  charged  upon  that  demon  of</span></p> <p><span>  temptation  which  encounters  every  young  J</span><span>  Irishman  on  the  threshold  of  Iiis  life-the  j</span><span>  conflict  raised  by  the  pernicious  exigencies  of</span><span>  English  rule  between  his  interest  and  his  duty.</span><span>  He  hearkened  to  the  tempter  who  raised  up</span><span>  O'Neill  and  O'ßcilly  against  their  kith  and</span><span>  creed,  who  corrupted  Saurín,  who  brought</span><span>  Hamilcar  PlunWot  down  to  bo  a  drivelling</span><span>  provincial  bigot,  and  who  has  for  many  a  year</span><span>  turned  the  arena  of  Irish  genius  into  a  slave</span><span>  market,  where  that  man  is  most  acceptable</span><span>  who  has  most  to  betray.  It  is  not  necessary</span></p> <p><span>  now  to  inquiro  whotner  ha  was  a  simple  .</span><span>  turncoat  or  a  hypocrite  as  well.  He  swore</span><span>  ""  dicers'  oaths,""  knowing  well  that  he  was</span><span>  f;oing  to  break  them.  He  vowed  fidelity,</span></p> <p><span>  ike  Marlborough,  up  to  thc  very  eve  of  his</span><span>  desertion.  The  famous  gang  who  marched  un-</span><span>  der  his  banner  wrecked  the  hopes  of  Ireland  for</span><span>  fifteen  years,  and  rendered  the  name  of  Parlia-</span><span>  mentary  action  loathsome.  This  reBult  and</span><span>  his  wages  would  have  glutted  the  malignity  of</span><span>  a  common  traitor.  It  only  whetted  Mr.</span><span>  Justice  Kcogh'B.  Somebody  has  said</span></p> <p><span>  ""There  ÍB  no  malice  like  the  malice  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  renegade.""  He  never  forgave  those  whom  he  I</span><span>  had  foully  wronged.  The  Church  which  he</span></p> <p><span>  had  beslavered  with  his  praises  became  thc  .</span><span>  target  of  his  scorn  and  hatred.  Thc  cliampion</span><span>  of  the  Pope  became  the  champion  of  Oliver</span><span>  Cromwell.  Thc  landlords  who  from  the  top</span><span>  of  a  Westmeath  coach  were  declared  to  be</span><span>  ""  the  most  heartless,  thriftless,  and  indefensible</span><span>  aristocracy  on  the  faco  of  the  earth  ""  came  to</span><span>  bc  held  up  in  Galway  as  the  natural  leaders</span><span>  and  protectors  of  the  people,  a  race  of  wronged</span><span>  archangels.

WHALLEY,  M.P.</span><span>  The  Daily  Chronicle  says  :-A  well-known  and</span><span>  prominent  figure  mil  be  missed  from  the</span><span>  House  of  Commons  when  Parliament  meets</span><span>  again  ;  hut  we  regret  to  learn  that  Mr.</span><span>  Whalley  has  succumbed  to  the  illness  which</span><span>  has  kept  him  prostrate  during  the  last  few</span><span>  months.  However  little  we  might  sympathise</span><span>  with  the  views  which  Mr.  Whalley  took  of</span><span>  various  matters,  we  could  not  fail  to  accord</span><span>  him  that  measure  of  respect  which  evident</span><span>  sincerity  of  purpose  and  honesty  of  conviction</span><span>  must  ever  evoke.  He  was  a  man  of  strong</span><span>  will,  and  when  he  had  once  made  up  his  mind</span><span>  ou  any  subject  it  was  impossible  to  make  lum</span><span>  alter  it.  The  mainspring  of  his  public  action</span><span>  was  suspicion  of  Popish  influence.  He  fancied</span><span>  that  he  saw  this  influence  generated  every-</span><span>  where,  and  that  he  detected  its  insidious</span><span>  operation  in  every  occurreuce,  from  the  New</span><span>  Zealand  war  to  thc  Tichborne  trial.  And  he</span><span>  had  thc  courage  of  his  opinions.  Year  after</span><span>  year,  unabashed  hy  previous  failure,  he  would</span><span>  move  thc  House  of  Commons  to  do  something</span><span>  or  other  which  he  deemed  calculated  to  check</span><span>  the  proceedings  of  the  Jesuits,  and  he  accepted</span><span>  his  overwhelming  defeat  with  an  air  of  resig-</span><span>  nation  becoming  a  martyr  in  a  righteous</span><span>  cause.  His  belief  in  thc  Tichborne  Claimant</span><span>  has  cuded  only  with  his  death,  and  his  con-</span><span>  viction  was  so  strong  that  he  committed</span><span>  contempt  of  Court  in  ""  Sir  Uoger's  ""  interests,</span><span>  and  was  sent  to  prison  in  consequence.  His</span><span>  persistence  in  introducing  motions  and  asking</span><span>  questions  in  thc  House  of  Commons  relative</span><span>  to  this  singular  case  was  really  remarkable,</span><span>  and  was  due  to  a  conscientious  belief  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  justice  of  tlic  cause  which  he  had  espoused,</span></p> <p><span>  and  for  which  he  worked  so  hard.  As  the</span><span>  representative  of  Peterborough  in  the  House</span><span>  of  Commons  for  more  than  a  quarter  of  a</span><span>  century,  Mr.  Whalley  won  for  himself  a</span><span>  unique  position  in  the  Législature.  Few</span><span>  members,  probably,  carried  less  weight  in</span><span>  Parliament  ;  but  while  men  laughed  at  his</span><span>  idiosyncrasies  and  ridiculed  his  arguments,</span><span>  they  were  forced  to  respect  his  integrity  and</span><span>  to  pay  a  tribute  to  his  sterling  worth.</span></p> <p><span>  A  coloured  man,  named  Bindoo,  working  at</span><span>  thc  Abbosford  Sugar  Mills,  on  the  Tweed</span><span>  river,  fell  into  the  clarifier,  and  was  badly</span><span>  scalded.</span></p> ",Article,1878-12-13,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin,  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  JANUARY  17,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  OF  the  ninety  candidates  for  Grammar</span></p> <p><span>  School  Scholarships  twenty-two  have</span><span>  passed,  and  all  of  these  but  one  are</span><span>  from  the  southern  districts.  The  reason</span><span>  is  palpable.  A  grammar  school  scholar-</span><span>  ship  to  a  boy  or  girl  in  Rockhampton,</span></p> <p><span>  Townsville,  or  Cooktown  would  be</span></p> <p><span>  practically  valueless.  It  is  worth  just</span></p> <p><span>  the  school  fees,  or  from  fourteen  to  six-</span><span>  teen  guineas  a-year  for  three  years.  But</span><span>  to  place  a  Rockhampton  pupil  in  either  of</span><span>  the  three  grammar  schools  in  the  colony</span><span>  costs  from  £60  to  £80  a-ycar.  The</span><span>  cholarship  scarcely  ?  one-fourth  of</span><span>  this,  and  parents  who  could  afford  to</span></p> <p><span>  spend  £50  to  £60  a-ycar  upon  the  edu-</span><span>  cation  of  a  boy  or  girl,  would  not  object</span><span>  to  spending  fifteen  guineas  additional.</span><span>  The  scholarship,  therefore,  is  scarcely</span><span>  an  appreciable  inducement  to  pupils  in</span><span>  any  of  the  northern  districts  ;  hence  the</span></p> <p><span>  fewness  of  the  candidates  from  the</span></p> <p><span>  north,  and  the  almost  entire  absorption</span><span>  of  the  scholarship  by  southern  boys  and</span><span>  girls.  Where  there  is  a  grammar  school</span><span>  in  or  near  a  town,  these  annual  exhibi-</span><span>  tions  are  worth  trying  for  and  excite</span><span>  competition  ;  and,  therefore,  if  we  wish</span><span>  a  share  of  them  to  be  won  by  pupils  in</span><span>  this  part  of  the  colony,  there  must  be  a</span></p> <p><span>  grammar  school  established  in  Rock-</span><span>  hampton.</span></p> <p><span>  The  late  Board  of  Education  did  not</span><span>  encourage  the  foundation  of  many</span><span>  grammar  schools.  They  very  properly</span><span>  held  that  one  or  two  strong  and  really</span><span>  effective  institutions  of  this  character  in</span><span>  the  colony  would  be  more  useful  than  a</span><span>  dozen  weaklings.  To  make  a  grammar</span><span>  school  efficient  a  corps  of  teachers,  each</span><span>  excelling  in  his  own  speciality,  is  absolutely</span><span>  requisite,  and  a  competent  teaching  staff</span><span>  cannot  be  obtained  for  a  small  school,</span></p> <p><span>  because  of  the  inevitable  expense  of</span><span>  the  establishment.  But  the  Board,</span><span>  while  adopting  the  policy  of  limita-</span><span>  tion  in  the  number  of  schools,  dis-</span><span>  played  a  far-seeing  liberality  in  the</span><span>  matter  of  scholarships,  which  under  their</span><span>  regime  were  worth  £50  a-year,  or  a</span><span>  total  of  £150.  The  result  was  that</span><span>  any  lad  winning  a  scholarship  in  former</span><span>  times  obtained  a  valuable  prize.  But  on</span><span>  the  passing  of  the  new  Education  Act  this</span><span>  liberality  was  found  to  have  been  abused.</span><span>  The  greater  proportion  of  scholarships</span><span>  had  been  taken  by  Brisbane  and  Ipswich</span><span>  boys,  who  thus  not  only  obtained  a</span><span>  remission  of  school  fees,  but  also  re-</span><span>  ceived  some  £35  a-year  while</span><span>  living  under  the  parental  roof.  Mr.</span><span>  Griffith  consquently  reduced  the</span><span>  value  of  scholarships  to  the  present</span><span>  limit,  and  Parliament  endorsed  the  al-</span><span>  teration.  A  dicriminating  scholarship</span><span>  was  suggested  that  is,  when  granted  to</span><span>  pupils  living  at  a  distance  from  any</span><span>  grammar  school,  the  cost  of  board  and</span><span>  lodging  to  be  allowed  in  addition  to  the</span><span>  school  fees;  but  the  suggestion  was  not</span><span>  favourably  received.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  policy  of  the  Board  we  find  an</span><span>  explanation  of  the  non-establishment  of</span><span>  a  grammar  sch00l  in  Rockhampton.</span><span>  Some  years  ago,  a  ""grammar  school  class''</span><span>  was  formed  in  connection  with  the  William-</span><span>  street  primary  school.  A  classical  teacher</span><span>  was  provided,  a  detached  building  erected,</span><span>  and  a  miniature  grammar  school  founded.</span><span>  When  secondary  education  was  thus</span><span>  supplied  free  of  charge  it  was  not  to  be</span><span>  expected  that  much  enthusiasm  would</span></p> <p><span>  be  displayed  in  getting  up  the  pre-</span><span>  liminary  subscription  for  a  fully  equipped</span><span>  grammar  school.  The  upper  class  did</span><span>  well  until  two  year  since,  when  the  new</span><span>  Education  Act  came  into  force  and</span></p> <p><span>  almost  suddenly  swept  it  away.  But</span><span>  even  then  any  movement  towards</span><span>  founding  a  grammar  school  was  checked</span><span>  by  the  belief  that  the  law  would  be</span><span>  further  amended  next  session.  Time  passed,  however,  and  no  opportunity  was</span><span>  found  to  deal  with  Mr.  Griffith's  secondary  education  bill.  The  result</span></p> <p><span>  is  that  1878  has  overtaken  us,  with</span><span>  no  public  school  in  Rockhampton  fit  for</span></p> <p><span>  a  child  who  has  attained  the  age  of</span><span>  twelve  years.  The  primary  schools  are  no  doubt  well-conducted,  but  no  incen-</span><span>  tive  is  supplied  to  industrious  and  quick-</span><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span>  witted  pupils.  There  is  nothing  beyond</span><span>  the  primary  standard,  and  little  in  the</span><span>  teaching  of  a  competitive  character</span><span>  beyond  the  acquirement  of  the  ""  three</span><span>  Rs.""  It  is  well  known  that  when  the</span></p> <p><span>  upper  class  was  abolished  in  William-</span><span>  street,  most  of  the  advanced  boys  were</span><span>  removed  to  grammar  schools  else-</span><span>  where,  while  those  put  back  into  the</span><span>  primary  division  remained  stagnant.</span><span>  They  had  got  beyond  the  ""  standard,""</span><span>  and  instead  of  pressing  forward  fell  de-</span><span>  cidedly  back.</span></p> <p><span>  One  important  benefit  to  be  antici-</span><span>  pated  from  the  establishment  of  a</span></p> <p><span>  grammar  school  in  Rockhampton  is  the</span><span>  improved  tone  it  must  give  to  the</span><span>  primary  schools.  A  percentage  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  pupils  will  keep  the  grammar  school</span></p> <p><span>  steadily  in  view  and  compete  for  the</span><span>  annual  scholarships.  Their  example  will</span></p> <p><span>  be  eminently  beneficial  to  the  other</span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span>  pupils.  The  knowledge  that  merit  will</span></p> <p><span>  win,  and  that  the  scholarships  are</span><span>  open  to  poor  and  rich  alike,  will</span></p> <p><span>  have  a  perceptibly  stimulating  effect.</span></p> <p><span></span><span></span><span>  There  is  a  ""public  opinion""  even  in</span><span>  a  primary  school,  and  the  steady  appli-</span></p> <p><span>  cation  of  half-a-dozen  brisk  and  clever</span></p> <p><span>  pupils  will  not  only  excite  emulation,</span></p> <p><span>  but  also  tend  to  make  laziness  unpopular.</span><span>  At  present  the  bright  boys  and  girls</span></p> <p><span>  either  leave  school  or  become  apathetic</span></p> <p><span></span><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span>  at  twelve  years,  the  evil  of  which  is</span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span>  appreciated  when  one  recollets  that  a</span></p> <p><span>  pupil  under  effective  instruction  will</span><span>  learn  much  more  rapidly  above  that  age</span><span>  than  under  it.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  no  doubt  that  the  movement</span></p> <p><span>  about  to  be  initiated  will  be  a  complete</span></p> <p><span>  success.  That  the  want  exists  and  is</span></p> <p><span>  urgent  everyone  must  admit  ;  that  there  is</span></p> <p><span>  full  scope  for  a  grammar  school</span><span>  in  Rockhampton  cannot  be  denied.  All</span><span>  that  is  needed  is  a  vigorous  and  united</span><span>  effort,  and  that  we  are  confident  will  not</span><span>  be  wanting.  The  preliminary  £1000</span><span>  once  in  the  hands  of  the  Government,</span><span>  we  might  fairly  claim  the  immediate</span><span>  erection  of  school  premises,  and  pending</span><span>  their  completion  might  press  for  the  re-</span></p> <p><span>  establishment  of  the  grammar  school</span><span>  class  at  William-street.  No  delay  should</span><span>  be  permitted,  for  our  advanced  primary</span></p> <p><span>  scholars  are  too  palpably  losing  time  and  heart.</span></p> <p><span>  TO-NIGHT  the  adjourned  annual  meeting  of</span><span>  the  members  of  the  Rockhampton  Jockey</span><span>  Club  will  be  held  at  the  Criterion  Hotel  at</span></p> <p><span>  eight  o'clock.</span></p> <p><span>  ATTENTION  is  directed  to  Mr.  M'Lean's</span><span>  lecture  this  evening,  on  the  Permissive  Bill.</span><span>  An  auxiliary  of  the  Queensland  Alliance  will</span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span>  </span><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span>  be  formed  after  the  lecture,  and  non-abstainers</span></p> <p><span>  are  admissible  as  members.</span></p> <p><span>  ON  inquiry  we  learn  that  the  subscriptions</span></p> <p><span>  to  the  Indian  Famine  Relief  Fund  continue  to</span></p> <p><span>  come  in  ;  that  £400  has  been  remitted  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  Mayor  of  Brisbane  ;  and  that  there  will  be</span></p> <p><span>  fully  another  £100  to  forward.  We  are  glad</span><span>  that  the  suggestion  to  remit  direct  to  Madras</span></p> <p><span>  was  not  adopted,  as  it  would  have  had  the</span></p> <p><span>  appearance  of  petty  jealousy  to  decline  to</span><span>  work  with  the  metropolitans  in  a  matter  of</span><span>  this  kind.</span></p> <p><span>  A  MEETING  was  held  at  the  offices  of  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  R.  L.  Dibdin  last  night,  for  the  purpose  of</span><span>  forming  a  new  Building  Society.  Mr.  James</span></p> <p><span>  Boyce  occupied  the  chair,  and  announced  that</span></p> <p><span>  328  shares,  which  were  held  by  fifty-eight</span></p> <p><span>  shareholders,  had  been  already  subscribed,  so</span></p> <p><span>  that  the  new  venture  would  commence  under</span><span>  favourahlc  auspices,  and  would  doubtless  meet</span></p> <p><span>  with  the  success  attending  previous</span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span>  societies  of  a  similar  character.  Mr.  R.

This  society  has  now  a  fair</span></p> <p><span>  start,  and  there  was  never  a  better  opening  for</span></p> <p><span>  a  new  organisation  of  the  kind  than  now.</span></p> <p><span>  The  town  is  bound  to  extend  as  railway  and</span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>  shipping  traffic  increases,  and  a  great  many</span><span>  new  buildings  are  certain  to  be  required  within</span><span>  the  next  year  or  two.</span></p> <p><span>  CREDITORS  in  Brisbane  and  Sydney  fre-</span><span>  quently  object  to  Rockhampton  creditors</span><span>  insisting  upon  the  appointment  of  a  local</span><span>  trustee  in  cases  of  liquidation  or  insolvency</span></p> <p><span>  They  contend  that  the  bulk  of  Rockhampton</span></p> <p><span>  insolvents'  liabilities  being  to  southern</span><span>  creditors,  and  that  the  official  trustee  in  in-</span><span>  solvency  being  stationed  at  Brisbane,  it  is</span></p> <p><span>  unfair  on  the  part  of  the  Rockhampton</span><span>  creditors  to  insist  upon  at  least  one  creditors'</span><span>  trustee  being  a  local  man.  But  this  is  taking  a</span><span>  one-sided  view  of  the  subject.  Southern</span><span>  creditors  like  to  retain  all  the  power  in</span><span>  their  own  hands,  and  send  agents</span><span>  to  wind  up  estates,  thus  consum-</span><span>  ing  the  assets  in  travelling  and  other</span><span>  expenses.  They  would  do  much  better,  how-</span><span>  ever,  to  entrust  the  business  to  a  local  trustee,</span><span>  who  being  on  the  spot,  and  knowing  everybody</span></p> <p><span>  concerned  in  an  insolvent's  affairs,  is  better</span></p> <p><span>  able  to  protect  the  creditors  interests  than  any</span><span>  stranger  possibly  can  be,  however  keen  as  a</span></p> <p><span>  business  man.  This  is  illustrated  by  the</span></p> <p><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span>  treatment  of  the  insolvent  estate  of  Edward</span><span>  M'Mulkin,  who  filed  his  schedulc  a  few  weeks</span><span>  ago.  The  creditors  being  all  local,  appointed</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  W.  G.  Caporn,  of  East-street,  as  their</span></p> <p><span>  sole  trustee,  and  the  result  is  a  speedy  winding</span><span>  up  of  the  estate  and  twenty  shillings  in  the</span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span>  pound  to  every  creditor.  Had  this  estate  re-</span></p> <p><span>  mained  in  the  hands  of  the  Official  Trustee  at</span></p> <p><span>  Brisbane,  or  been  remitted  to  non-resident</span><span>  creditors'  trustees,  instead  of  twenty  shillings</span><span>  the  creditors  would  have  got  nothing.

The  occupants</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  vehicle  were  thrown  rather  heavily  to</span><span>  the  ground,  and  Mrs.  Warnock  was  picked  up</span><span>  insensible  and  carried  into  the  hotel,  where</span></p> <p><span>  she  was  attended  to  by  Dr.  Robertson,  who</span></p> <p><span>  happened  to  be  passing  at  the  time  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  mishap.  The  Doctor  found  that  no  bones</span><span>  were  broken,  and  although  the  lady  was</span></p> <p><span>  rather  severly  bruised,  no  serious  conse-</span></p> <p><span></span><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span></span><span>  quences  are  anticipated.  Mr.  Warnock</span></p> <p><span>  escaped  with  some  scratches,  and  the  child</span><span>  seemed  more  frightened  than  hurt.  The</span></p> <p><span>  accident  occurred  through  the  bolt  con-</span></p> <p><span>  necting  one  of  the  shafts  with  the</span></p> <p><span>  body  of  the  buggy  falling  out,  and  the  shaft</span><span>  striking  the  horse's  leg,  the  animal  became  un-</span></p> <p><span>  manageable,  and  hence  the  upset.

They  had  conveyed  tools</span></p> <p><span>  into  their  cells  ;  and  in  the  middle  of  the</span><span>  night  (says  the  S.  M.  Herald)  after  having</span><span>  first  torn  their  bed-coverings  into  strips  to</span><span>  serve  as  ropes,  they  made  a  small  hole  in  the</span><span>  door,  through  which  they  contrived  to  pick</span><span>  the  padlock  ontside  .  They  were  now  in  the</span><span>  corridor,  and  the  next  step  was  to  throw  the</span><span>  bedding-made  rope  over  a  beam  supporting  a</span><span>  tank  in  a  corner  of  the  wing,  by  which  means</span><span>  they  were  enabled  to  get  above  the  ceiling  and</span><span>  immediately  under  the  roof.  To  make  a  hole</span></p> <p><span>  in  the  roof  by  cutting  through  the  wooden</span><span>  covering  and  removing  a  few  slates  was  a  work</span><span>  of  no  great  difficulty.  The  next  step  intended</span><span>  was  no  doubt  to  descend  into  the  yard  by</span><span>  means  of  the  rope  and  then  to  get  over  the</span><span>  outside  wall  ;  but  unfortunately  for  the  pri-</span><span>  soners,  though  fortunately  for  society,  an</span><span>  armed  warder  was  patrolling  in  the  yard</span><span>  below.  The  warder  did  not  see  the  prisoners</span><span>  peeping  out  through  the  roof,  but  he  could  be</span><span>  seen  by  them,  and  they  knowing  that  to</span><span>  attempt  to  descend  would  be  to  perhaps  risk</span><span>  their  lives,  without  even  the  chance  of  escape,</span><span>  were  compelled  to  abandon  their  project.  They</span><span>  did  not,  however,  go  back  to  their  cells,  but</span><span>  remained  under  the  roof  until  the  morning,</span><span>  when,  their  cell  being  found  empty,  a  search</span><span>  was  instituted  and  their  hiding  place  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  covered.  Since  then  the  prisoners  have  been</span><span>  brought  up  before  the  visiting  justice,  and,  for</span></p> <p><span>  their  attempt  to  escape,  they  are  now  under-</span><span>  going  a  month's  solitary  confinement.</span></p> <p><span>  EXPERIMENTS  WITH  THE  TELEPHONE.—</span><span>  Some  interesting  experiments  with  the  tele-</span><span>  phone  were  made  on  Saturday  evening  at  the</span><span>  Electric  Telegraphic  Office,  Melbourne,  by  Mr.</span><span>  Payter,  the  assistant  manager,  and  Mr.</span><span>  Edwards,  who  has  devoted  considerable  atten-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  to  the  new  system  of  telegraphy.  The</span><span>  experiments  (says  The  Age)  took  place  in  two</span><span>  rooms  of  the  building  remote  from  each  other,</span><span>  the  distance  being  regulated  by  a  box  of</span><span>  resistance  coils,  by  means  of  which  communi-</span><span>  cation  was  artificially  extended  to  a  distance</span><span>  of  sixty-six  and  a-half  miles.  Commencing  at</span><span>  ten  miles  a  number  of  messages  were  trans-</span><span>  mitted  and  came  through  with  great  distinct-</span><span>  ness.  As  the  distance  was  gradually  increased</span><span>  there  was  no  perceptible  difference  in  the</span><span>  volume  of  sound,  and  at  fifty  miles  (using  still</span><span>  the  resistance  coils)  the  following  messages</span><span>  and  replies  were  transmitted  without  the</span><span>  slightest  misconception  of  their  meaning  :—</span><span>  ""What  o'cIock  is  it  ?""  ""  I  don't  know.""</span></p> <p><span>  ""You  will  find  a  clock  in  the  other  office.""</span><span>  ""  All  right  ;  it  is  a  quarter-past  ten.''  ""  All</span><span>  right.  What  do  you  say  to  a  refresher  ?""</span><span>  ""  Not  the  least  objection.""  At  the  sixty-six</span><span>  and  a  half  miles  messages  were  exchanged</span><span>  with  no  greater  dilficiilty,  and  the  value  of  the</span><span>  new  process  was  beyond  doubt  fully  estab-</span><span>  lished.  One  drawback  manifested  itself,</span><span>  which,  however,  can  be  obtained  with  very</span><span>  little  trouble.  The  message  had  to  be  spoken</span><span>  ""  at  ""  the  instrument  in  a  loud  tone  of  voice,</span><span>  but  an  experiment  with  the  mouthpiece  of  an</span><span>  ordinary  speaking-tube  proved  conclusively</span><span>  that  a  message  thrown  through  this  gave  it</span><span>  more  resonance,  and  intensified  the  articula-</span></p> <p><span>  tion.</span></p> <p><span>  A  REVOLUTIONARY  PROGRAMME.—Mr.  A.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin,</span><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  FEBRUARY  16,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THERE  is  reason  to  believe  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  influence  of  Mr.  Garrick  has  already</span><span>  made  itself  felt  in  the  Cabinet.  Despite</span><span>  the  very  wholesome  advice  given  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  Premier  last  session,  he  seems  to  have</span></p> <p><span>  found  the  temptation  irresistible  to  usurp</span><span>  the  functions  of  the  legislature  during</span><span>  the  recess.  That  the  Polynesian  pro-</span><span>  clamation  did  not  issue  for  two  months</span><span>  after  the  prorogation,  was  due  to  the</span><span>  circumstance  that  Ministers  were  on</span><span>  furlough  from  the  beginning  of  Novem-</span></p> <p><span>  ber  until  the  close  of  the  Christmas</span></p> <p><span>  and  New  Year  holidays.  The  Premier,</span><span>  moreover,  on  retuning  from  Thursday</span><span>  Island,  was  compelled  to  pass  through  the</span><span>  deep  waters  of  personal  affliction,  and</span><span>  did  not  recover  tone  until  Mr.  Thorn's</span><span>  contemplated  resignation  aroused  him</span><span>  to  the  necessity  of  taking  some  ""  new</span><span>  departure  ""  for  the  purposes  of  diverting</span><span>  public  attention  and  recovering  popular</span><span>  favour.  He  soon  discovered  that  nothing</span><span>  could  be  done  with  the  Chinese  ques-</span><span>  tion,  and  that  not  even  the  proceedings</span><span>  against  the  Chinese  abductor  of  a</span><span>  European  girl  from  Melbourne,  or  the</span><span>  incarceration  of  the  leper  at  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton,  could  be  utilised  for  exciting  popular</span></p> <p><span>  enthusiasm  on  behalf  of  a  ""  Liberal</span><span>  Ministry.""  So  he  reviewed  the  Polyne-</span><span>  sian  question,  and  finally  determined  to</span><span>  play  the  trump  card  furnished  to  him  by</span><span>  Mr.  Nixon  several  months  previously.  It</span><span>  was  in  September  that  the  Premier  drew</span><span>  upon  the  Treasury  to  defray  Mr.  Nixon's</span><span>  travelling  expenses  two  or  three</span><span>  times  between  Brisbane.  Maryborough,</span><span>  Rockhampton,  and  Mackay.  At  first</span><span>  this  complaisant  government  agent  could</span><span>  not  give  acceptable  evidence,  and  it  was</span><span>  not  until  several  journeys  had  been  per-</span><span>  formed,  and  as  many  interviews  had  been</span><span>  ""  negotiated,""  that  Mr.  Nixon  discovered</span><span>  the  kind  of  testimony  sought  for  by  the</span><span>  Premier.  But  ultimately  the  witness</span><span>  grasped  the  situation,  and  furnished</span><span>  a  ministerial  journal  with  a  narrative</span><span>  which,  whether  true  or  false,  most</span><span>  unequivocally  condemned  himself.  If</span><span>  the  trade  is  so  repulsive  as  Mr.  Nixon</span><span>  pourtrays,  why  does  he—a  gentleman</span><span>  by  birth  and  education—remain  con-</span><span>  nected  with  it  ?  What  attraction  could</span><span>  be  sufficient  to  keep  a  person  of  Mr.</span><span>  Nixon's  abilities,  attainments,  and</span><span>  experience  in  the  miserably  paid  office</span><span>  of  Polynesian  agent  on  board  a  ""  slave  ""</span></p> <p><span>  schooner  ?  It  is  quite  concevable  that  a</span><span>  gentleman  desirous  of  seeing  life  under</span><span>  all  its  phases,  or  needing  change  of  air</span><span>  and  scene,  might  submit  to  the  degrada-</span><span>  tion  of  inspecting  the  proceedings  on  one</span><span>  Polynesian  labour  cruise  ;  but  it  is  not</span><span>  conceivable  that  a  gentleman  should</span><span>  choose  to  permanently  adopt  a  pro-</span><span>  fession  in  which,  if  Mr.  Nixon</span><span>  be  credited,  he  must  be  a</span><span>  spectator  of  loathsome  if  not  in-</span><span>  human  transactions,  unless  on  the</span><span>  assumption  that  he  is  the  victim</span><span>  of  grievous  moral  deterioration.</span><span>  Such  assumption,  however,  materially</span></p> <p><span>  lessens  the  value  of  his  testimony,  and</span></p> <p><span>  necessitates  caution  in  its  reception.</span><span>  We  shall  not  here  canvass  Mr.  Nixon's</span><span>  statements,  for  a  writer  in  the  Brisbane</span><span>  Courier  has  effectively  done  that.  Our</span><span>  business  to-day  is  to  direct  attention  to</span><span>  the  singular  conduct  of  the  Premier  in</span><span>  making  use  of  so  equivocal  a  witness  to</span><span>  bolster  up  the  popularity  of  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  careless  of  the  slanderous  imputa-</span><span>  tions  cast  upon  everyone  engaged  in  the</span><span>  South  Sea  trade,  and  indifferent  to  the</span><span>  mischief  inflicted  upon  all  persons</span><span>  engaged  in  industries  dependent  upon</span><span>  Polynesian  labour.</span></p> <p><span>  The  instructions  issued  by  Mr.  Douglas</span><span>  in  January  assumed  that  Queensland</span><span>  captains  and  shipowners  had  been  and</span><span>  were  still  guilty  of  the  heinous  crime  of</span><span>  trafficking  in  human  flesh.  The  agents</span><span>  were  required  to  prohibit  the  giving  of</span><span>  ""  trade  ""  under  any  circumstances,  and</span><span>  thus  by  a  stroke  of  his  pen  Mr.  Douglas</span></p> <p><span>  virtually  prohibited  the  recruiting  of</span><span>  Polynesians  altogether.  Now,  this  last</span><span>  possibly  would  be  a  very  good  thing  lo</span><span>  do.  It  might  ruin  some  industries,  and</span><span>  impede  the  progress  of  the  colony  ;  but</span></p> <p><span>  it  would  extinguish  an  effective  political</span><span>  cry,  and  conciliate  that  section  of  the</span><span>  so-called  working  men  who  will</span></p> <p><span>  neither  perform  hard  work  themselves</span><span>  nor  permit  the  Kanaka  to  do</span></p> <p><span>  so.  At  present,  however,  the</span><span>  law  of  the  land  authorises  Polynesian</span><span>  recruiting,  and  if  Mr.  Douglas  wants  to</span><span>  abolish  it  he  must  do  so  by  Act  of</span><span>  Parliament.  He  has  no  more  right  to</span><span>  make  the  Polynesian  trade  contraband</span><span>  than  he  has  to  suppress  the  entire  class  of</span><span>  trading  politicians,  of  whom  the  Premier</span><span>  of  the  colony  is  unfortunately  one.  The</span><span>  same  remark  applies  to  the  proclamation</span><span>  under  which  returning  Polynesians  were</span><span>  unlawfully  deprived  of  their  fowling-pieces</span></p> <p><span>  and  ammunition.  The  issue  of  this</span><span>  edict,  as  well  as  the  instructions  with</span></p> <p><span>  regard  to  trade,  was  a  plain  violation  of</span><span>  the  law  by  a  Minister  sworn  to  faithfully</span><span>  administer  it.</span></p> <p><span>  We  shall  be  told,  however,  that  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Douglas  has  retraced  his  steps  ;  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  obnoxious  proclamation  and  instructions</span><span>  have  been  withdrawn  ;  and  that  hence-</span></p> <p><span>  forward  no  more  illegalities  will  be  per-</span><span>  petrated.  But  we  reply  thal  there  is</span><span>  another  edict  extant  which  confessedly</span></p> <p><span>  usurped  the  functions  of  the  Legislature</span></p> <p><span>  when  issued,  which  Parliament  has  never</span></p> <p><span>  sanctioned,  and  which  is  still  maintained</span><span>  in  force.  We  refer  to  the  regulations</span></p> <p><span>  under  which  it  is  prohibited  to  take</span><span>  Polynesians  more  than  thirty  miles  from</span><span>  the  sea-coast.  If  Ministers  have  deter-</span><span>  mined  lo  hark  back  and  henceforward</span></p> <p><span>  administer  the  laws  in  strict  conformity</span><span>  with  constitutional  practice,  why  is</span></p> <p><span>  not  a  clean  sweep  made  of  all  un-</span><span>  lawful  regulations  ?  Simply  because  the</span><span>  employers  of  Polynesians  on  the  coast</span><span>  are  presumed  to  be  supporters  of  the</span><span>  Government,  while  the  employers  inland</span><span>  are  ranked  among  their  opponents.</span><span>  Under  these  circumstanced  it  is  impos-</span></p> <p><span>  sible  to  believe  that  the  rescinding  pro-</span><span>  clamation  has  been  issued  because  the</span><span>  bounds  of  legality  had  been  inadver-</span><span>  tently  passed.  The  motive  power  has</span><span>  not  been  a  sense  of  what  is  due  to  right</span><span>  and  justice,  but  is  simply  political</span></p> <p><span>  pressure.  It  was  because  the  regulation</span><span>  touched  the  sugar  grower  that  it  was</span><span>  rescinded,  and  not  because  it  was  illegal.</span><span>  This  circumstance  deprives  the  Ministerial</span><span>  retreat  of  all  its  imputed  virtue,  and</span><span>  proves  that  their  aim  is  not  to  do  right,</span><span>  but  to  win  political  support.  And  we</span><span>  much  regret  that  Mr.  Garrick  rows  in</span><span>  their  boat,  and  has  elected  to  share  their</span></p> <p><span>  dishonour.</span></p> <p><span>  IT  is  reported  that  the  Hon.

Not</span></p> <p><span>  being  in  the  confidence  of  the  Government,</span><span>  we  are  unable  to  give  an  authoritative</span><span>  explanation  ;  but  we  have  reason  to  believe</span><span>  that  the  facts  are  simply  these  :  Mr.</span><span>  M'Ilwraith  is  a  large  holder  of  pastoral</span><span>  country  on  both  sides  of  the  South  Australian</span><span>  border,  and  being  called  to  Adelaide  on  busi-</span><span>  ness  was  authorised  by  Mr.  Douglas  to  lay</span><span>  before  the  South  Australian  Government  the</span></p> <p><span>  importance  of  getting  the  boundary-line</span><span>  marked  at  the  joint  expense  of  the  two  colonies.</span><span>  The  transaction  is  purely  a  business  one,  and</span><span>  had  not  Mr.  M'Ilwraith  been  a  prominent</span><span>  politician  it  would  not  have  excited  remark.</span><span>  As  to  Mr.  M'Ilwraith  becoming  the  leader  of</span><span>  a  prospective  third  party,  we  believe  that</span><span>  gentleman  is  of  the  opinion  that  our  present</span><span>  Legislative  Assembly  scarcely  contains  the</span><span>  materials  for  two  defined  parties.  Mr.</span><span>  M'Ilwraith  is  a  man  who  determinedly</span><span>  exercises  the  right  of  free  speech,  but  we  do</span><span>  not  believe  that  those  who  connect  his  name</span><span>  with  the  proposal  to  lead  a  third  party  have</span><span>  the  slightest  warranty  for  their  conjectures.</span><span>  Like  most  other  leading  members  of  the  Op-</span><span>  position,  Mr.  M'Ilwraith  is  a  thorough-going</span><span>  Liberal,  but  he  has  no  sympathy</span><span>  with  those  professional  politicians  who</span><span>  trade  on  Liberalism,  and  who  retain</span><span>  office  by  exciting  class  antagonisms.</span><span>  Mr.  M'Ilwraith  is  a  public  man  with  whose</span><span>  opinions  we  do  not  always  agree,  but  we  have</span><span>  some  faith  in  his  fidelity  to  political  associates,</span><span>  and  we  do  not  believe  that  he  would  consent  to</span></p> <p><span>  play  in  Queensland  the  role  assumed  by  Mr.</span><span>  Farnell  in  New  South  Wales.  Mr.  Farnell's</span><span>  action  is  only  excusable  on  the  assumption  that</span><span>  his  whilom  leader  had  proved  false  or  incapable.</span><span>  But  no  such  justification  for  the  attempt  to</span><span>  form  a  third  party  exists  in  Queensland  and</span><span>  we  believe  the  leading  members  of  our  Opposi-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  are  quite  confident  to  bide  their  time.</span></p> <p><span>  They  are  conscious  that  sooner  or  later  the</span><span>  scales  will  fall  from  men's  eyes,  and  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  honoured  name  of  Liberalism  will  not  for</span><span>  ever  be  prostituted  with  impunity.  The</span><span>  course  followed  by  Mr.  M'Ilwraith  in  acting</span><span>  honorarily  for  the  Government  must  be  taken</span></p> <p><span>  to  prove,  not  that  he  is  currying  favour  with</span><span>  Ministers,  but  that  he  prefers  country  to</span><span>  party.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Central  Queensland  Graziers'  and</span></p> <p><span>  Farmers'  Society  will  hold  a  general</span><span>  meeting  at  the  Normandy  Hotel  this  afternoon,</span><span>  for  the  purpose  of  receiving  the  report  of  the</span><span>  Sub-committee  appointed  to  arrange  the  prize</span></p> <p><span>  schedule.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court  yesterday,  before  the</span><span>  Police  Magistrate,  one  drunkard  was  ad-</span><span>  monished  and  discharged.

The  Copperfield</span><span>  meeting,  however,  resolved  that  as  the</span><span>  Sydney  directors  had  not  signified  their  desire</span><span>  to  have  representatives  on  the  Board,  and  as</span><span>  it  was  not  considered  that  the  interests  of  the</span><span>  Company  would  be  promoted  by  such  repre-</span><span>  sentation,  the  number  of  directors  should  be</span><span>  seven  only,  five  to  be  chosen  from  Copperfield</span><span>  and  two  from  Rockhampton.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Melbourne  Steam  Shipping  Company</span><span>  appear  determined  to  push  their  way  into  the</span><span>  Queensland  trade,  and  give  proof  of  the</span><span>  permanency  of  their  arrangements  by  the</span><span>  publication  of  an  exquisitely  got  up  Hand-book,</span><span>  showing  the  names  of  their  vessels,  dates  of</span><span>  arrivai  and  departure  at  the  various  ports,  and</span><span>  rates  of  freight  and  passage-money.

This  bull  possesses  those</span><span>  points  peculiar  to  the  Brunswick  breed,  viz.,</span><span>  level,  thick  in  flesh,  symmetrical,  rich  in</span><span>  hair  and  colour,  vigorous,  and  bearing</span><span>  strong  and  characteristic  likeness  throughout.</span><span>  He  is  a  roan,  calved  May  23,  1876  ;  got  by</span><span>  Cherry  Oxford  out  of  Duchess  of  Bruns-</span><span>  wick  by  Duke  of  Brunswick.  The  pedigree</span><span>  runs  back  through  the  following  :—Butterfly</span><span>  Flower  by  Royal  Butterfly  16th  ;  April  Flower</span></p> <p><span>  2nd  by  Royal  Butterfly  6th  ;  April  Flower</span><span>  (imported)  by  Richard  Cœur  de  Lion  ;  May-</span><span>  flower  by  Abraham  Parker  ;  Gay  Lass  by</span></p> <p><span>  Ethelred  ;  Gaity  by  Albert  ;  Winifred  by</span><span>  Fitzmaurice  ;  Wealthy  by  Brougham.  Cherry</span><span>  Oxford's  Brunswick  was  awarded  the  first</span><span>  prize  in  the  Victoria  Agricultural  Society's</span><span>  Show,  Heidelberg,  1877,  and  first  prize  in  his</span><span>  class  at  the  Grand  National  Show  held  at</span><span>  Stawell  in  October  last.  Cherry  Oxford,  the</span><span>  sire,  won  the  first  prize  at  the  Grand  National</span><span>  Show,  Sandhurst,  as  well  as  the  Champion</span><span>  prize  as  the  best  male  animal  in  the  yard,</span><span>  and  was  sold  for  1000  guineas  by  Mr.  Gardiner.</span><span>  Cherry  Oxford  was  out  of  Matilda  4th,  the</span><span>  winner  of  three  first  prizes  in  Victoria.  Oxford</span><span>  Cherry  Duke,  the  sire  of  Cherry  Oxford,  was</span><span>  purchased  by  Messrs.  Robertson  Brothers,  of</span><span>  Colac,  for  £2500,  and  his  stock  have  taken  a</span><span>  leading  position  in  the  show  yards  of  Victoria  ;</span><span>  he  is  also  the  sire  of  many  well-known</span><span>  animals  that  have  all  been  prize  winners.

At  the  time  for  commencing</span><span>  the  proceedings  very  few  persons  were  present,</span><span>  and  it  was  not  until  nearly  half-past  eight</span><span>  that  the  attendance  rendered  it  advisable  to</span><span>  open  the  meeting.  Mr  J.  J.  Wood  was  voted</span><span>  to  the  chair.  He  read  a  letter  from  himself,</span><span>  as  secretary  to  the  retiring  Committee,  to  the</span><span>  Chairman  of  the  meeting,  requesting  him  to</span><span>  inform  the  parents  not  to  permit  the  names  of</span><span>  any  of  the  present  Comitteemen  to  be  nomi-</span><span>  nated.  He  might  say  that  when  the</span><span>  present  Committee  was  appointed  they</span><span>  were  led  to  understand  from  the  Edu-</span></p> <p><span>  cation  Office  that  they  were  to  con-</span><span>  tinue  in  office  for  three  years  ;  now  they</span><span>  received  a  notice  that  for  the  future  Com-</span><span>  mittees  would  be  chosen  annually.  Mr.  D.</span><span>  Armstrong  asked  the  Chairman  if  there  was</span><span>  no  report  from  the  Committee  to  lay  before</span><span>  the  meeting.  The  Chairman  replied  there  was</span><span>  none.  Mr.  R.  Sharples  moved  that  the  meet-</span><span>  ing  be  adjourned  for  three  months,  to  enable</span><span>  the  Committee  to  furnish  a  report  stating</span><span>  their  reasons  for  refusing  to  serve  again.  It</span><span>  was  evident  they  had  encountered  difficulties,</span><span>  which  the  new  Committee,  if  appointed,  would</span><span>  also  have  to  contend  against,  and  he  for  one</span><span>  would  not  like  to  be  nominated  until  he  knew</span></p> <p><span>  what  they  were.  Mr  Danker  seconded  the</span><span>  motion.  After  some  discussion  the  motion</span><span>  was  put  to  the  meeting,  and  carried.  The</span><span>  want  of  interest  in  the  nomination  of  a  Com-</span></p> <p><span>  mittee  for  this  school,  evidencing  the</span><span>  absence  of  complaints,  is  a  satisfactory</span><span>  proof  thal  the  head-teacher,  Mr.  Potts,  is</span><span>  discharging  his  duties  in  an  efficient  manner.</span><span>  This  remark  seems  to  apply  to  the  great</span><span>  majority  of  schools,  and  especially  to  those  of</span><span>  Rockhampton.  lt  must  be  satisfactory  to  the</span><span>  teachers  to  find  that  their  labours  are  becoming</span><span>  better  appreciated.</span></p> <p><span>  A  SMALL  parcel  of  gold,  weighing  about</span><span>  42  ozs.  6  dwts.,  the  result  of  a  crushing  of</span><span>  eighty-five  tons  of  surface  stone,  at  Messrs.</span></p> <p><span>  Wilder  and  party's  Duke  of  Brittany  Reef,  at</span><span>  Raglan,  was  brought  into  town  during  the</span><span>  week.

The</span><span>  secrecy  observed  i  i  the  peace  negotia-</span><span>  tions,  and  the  rel  cence  imposed  upon</span><span>  the  Porte  with  rcs  icct  to  the  terms  of</span></p> <p><span>  peace  granted,  ani[  ly  justified  European</span><span>  distrust  ;  and  nov  thal  the  treaty  of</span><span>  peace  has  been  rati  lied,  Russia  still  ap-</span><span>  parently  invests  its  details  with  secrecy.</span><span>  The  demand  ma  le  by  Great  Britain</span><span>  and  Austria,  howe  ver,  that  the  whole</span><span>  treaty  shall  be  submitted  to  the</span><span>  Congress,  is  &lt;  niirely  reasonable,</span><span>  .and  there  is  little  doubt  that</span><span>  Russia  will  ult  ruately  assent  to</span><span>  it.  It  is  prepostei  sus  that  in  the  face</span><span>  of  previous  Europe  m  treaties,  the  terms</span><span>  of  which  were  se  tied  after  protracted</span><span>  warfare,  Russia  si  auld  be  allowed  to</span><span>  treat  separately  wit  i  the  Porte  on  matters</span><span>  of  general  Euroi""  :an  concern.  Both</span><span>  Austria  and  Grea  Britain  are  deeply</span><span>  involved  in  the  qui  stions  affected  by  the</span><span>  treaty  of  Paris,  a  id  it  is  gratifying  to</span><span>  find  thal  they  are  (  3-operatingin  a  policy</span><span>  which  must  event!  ally  bring  Russia  to</span></p> <p><span>  book.  Austria  canr  at  afford  to  hand  over</span><span>  the  mouths  of  her  jreat  river  to  Russia,</span><span>  not  can  Great  Brit  lin  permit  that  Power</span><span>  to  acquire  even  a  collateral  interest  in</span><span>  the  Egyptian  tribute.  So  it  is  not  sur-</span><span>  prising  that  serious  negotiations  for  an</span><span>  alliance  arc  proc  ;eding,  and  that  both</span></p> <p><span>  Great  Britain  ar  1  Austria  have  deter-</span><span>  mined  to  permit  no  further  encroach-</span><span>  ments  upon  heir  mutual  rights.</span><span>  Germany  appear!  to  be  still  taking  the</span><span>  part  of  Russia,  b  it  it  is  becoming  more</span><span>  and  more  evider  t  that  the  Czar  cannot</span></p> <p><span>  rely  upon  the  sup  7ort  of  German  armies.</span><span>  Public  opinion  n  Europe  is  against</span><span>  the  Czar,  and  ho  fever  Prince  Bismarck</span></p> <p><span>  might  assist  Rujsian  projects  by  diplo-</span></p> <p><span>  matic  support,  not  even  he  would  dare</span></p> <p><span>  take  up  arms  in  jheir  favour.  The  con-</span></p> <p><span>  clusion  is  irievit  tble,  therefore,  that  the</span><span>  Congress  will  b  eventually  held,  and</span><span>  that  the  whole  te  ms  of  peace  between</span><span>  the  late  belliger  ¡nts  will  come  under</span></p> <p><span>  review.  No  dou  Jt  there  will  be  much</span></p> <p><span>  preliminary  neg  itiation,  accompanied</span><span>  by  indirect  tin  sats  and  distressing</span></p> <p><span>  rumours  of  wai  But  there  is  no</span></p> <p><span>  evidence  to  indi'  ate  that  Russia  is  pre-</span><span>  pared  to  incur  cl  istisement  hy  a  power-</span><span>  ful  European  &lt;  oalition,  rather  than</span><span>  accede  to  the  equitable  settlement</span><span>  demanded  by  thc  cading  Powers.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  conclusion  is,  therefore,  that  the</span><span>  mother  country  viii  not  be  actually</span><span>  dragged  into  war.  Russian  diplomatists</span><span>  will  carry  resistant  e  to  the  utmost  limit</span><span>  compatible  with  thc  maintenance  of</span><span>  peace;  but  they  w  ll  certainly  not  decide</span><span>  to  fight  a  formid;  ble  coalition  without</span><span>  the  aid  of  al  ies.  All  that  is</span><span>  needed,  then,  t  >  secure  an  equit-</span><span>  able  and  sat  sfactory  settlement</span><span>  appears  to  be  d  icision  on  thc  part</span><span>  of  the  British  Gove  rnment,  and  that  they</span><span>  are  clearly  determi  lcd  to  manifest.  Sir</span><span>  Stafford  Northcote  informs  the  House</span><span>  of  Commons  that  Great  Britain  will</span><span>  maintain  her  o\  n  views,  and  that</span><span>  circumstances  jus  ify  the  retention  of</span><span>  the  fleet  near  Con  ;tantiuople.  And  as</span><span>  the  Government  w  ll  be  enthusiastically</span><span>  supported  by  the  r  ition  in  carrying  out</span><span>  a  vigorous  policy,  I  ere  need  be  no  ap-</span><span>  prehension  that  diplomacy,  however</span><span>  crooked  and  prot  acted,  will  be  suc-</span><span>  ceeded  by  actual  &lt;  'ar.

"<p><span>  j  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  i  ^</span></p> <p><span>  !  THURSDAY,  APIUL  IS,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  TUR  more  closely  he  prospects  of  the</span><span>  forthcoming  session  are  scanned  the  less</span><span>  probability  does  th  :re  appear  to  be  of</span><span>  any  good  work  bc  ng  done.  This,  of</span><span>  course,  is  on  the  tssumption  that  the</span><span>  Government  have  .  letcrmincd  to  make</span><span>  a  representation  bill  the  measure  of  the</span><span>  session.  It  is  not  j  :t  six  years  since  the</span><span>  existing  Redistribuí  ¡on  Act  was  passed,</span><span>  after  the  failure  of  several  attempts  at</span><span>  reform  in  previou  ;  years,  and  after</span><span>  nearly  the  whole  session  of  1872</span><span>  had  been  consul  led  in  prolonged</span><span>  discussion  on  the  question.  At  that</span><span>  time,  moreover,  t  ie  Opposition  were</span><span>  numerically  weak,  .'hile  the  Ministerial</span><span>  party  were  strong  ii  numbers  as  well  as</span><span>  in  their  leader,  Mr.  Palmer,  acknow-</span><span>  ledged  to  be  thc  most  capable  Premier</span><span>  tlie  colony  had  sein,  at  any  rate  since</span><span>  the  departure  of  Mr.  Herbert.  A  Redis-</span><span>  tribution  Bill  at  arly  time  is  a  most  diffi-</span><span>  cult  one  to  push  tlrough  Parliament,  no</span><span>  matter  how  urglnt  the  necessity  for</span></p> <p><span>  reform.  But  inj  this  colony  no  such</span><span>  urgency  exists.  {There  are  inequalities,</span><span>  no  doubt,  but  j  scarcely  more  than</span><span>  may  again  occur  before  a  new  measure</span><span>  has  been  twelve  (months  in  force.  To</span><span>  have  mathematical  accuracy  in  electoral</span><span>  distribution  is  it  ipossible,  and  all  that</span><span>  can  be  hoped  for  is  to  remove  the  more</span><span>  glaring  inequality  s.  Take  any  country</span><span>  in  the  world,  not  excepting  the  United</span><span>  States  of  Americ  ,  and  inequalities  will</span><span>  periodically  occu  ,  The  rapid  progress</span><span>  made  by  Caltforr  an  and  other  western</span><span>  states  must  have  lisfranchised  thousands</span><span>  of  American  ci  zens  for  years  at  a</span><span>  stretch,  as  the  r&lt;  distribution  only  takes</span><span>  placeafterthecol  ectingof  thc  census  at</span><span>  the  close  of  eac  1  decade.  Compared</span><span>  with  America,  th  refore,  the  inequalities</span><span>  in  Queensland  ar  trifling  ;  and  there  is</span><span>  no  sufficient  rea  m  for  stopping  the</span><span>  public  business  at  i  throwing  the  colony</span><span>  i  into  a  state  of  tt  rmoil  in  this  year  of</span></p> <p><span>  grace.

Admitting,</span><span>  for  argument  sak  ,  that  the  principle</span><span>  of  single  electoratt  s  as  applied  to  con-</span><span>  centrated  populatic  is  is  a  mistake,  there</span><span>  is  no  such  urgency  ir  reform  as  to  justify</span><span>  the  Government  in  deranging  the  public</span><span>  affairs  of  the  colonj  by  proposing  funda-</span><span>  mental  changes  at  1  ie  present  juncture.</span><span>  And  the  more  so  s  it  is  believed  by</span><span>  members  of  both  parties  that  such</span><span>  changes  cannot  be  &lt;  msummated  before</span><span>  the  present  Assembl;  expires  by  effluxion</span></p> <p><span>  of  time.  That  e  ent  will  occur  in</span><span>  November  next  (if  tnere  be  no  previous</span><span>  dissolution),  and  writl  will  then  issue  for</span><span>  the  new  elections,  which  in  the  usual</span><span>  course  will  take  placel  in  January.

To</span><span>  admit  of  the  roll-prcparííg  going  on</span><span>  smoothly  the  new  Redistribution  Bill</span><span>  must  become  law  early  in  jjuly,  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  local  Benches  are  requirád  to  appoint</span><span>  collectors  before  the  ist  A  igust.  Now,</span><span>  we  ask  any  person  who  has  watched</span><span>  Parliamentary  proceedings,  what  chance</span><span>  there  is  of  gelling  a  Redis  ribution  Bill</span><span>  making  fundamental  cha  iges  through</span><span>  both  Houses  in  two  monthi  ?  It  is  no</span></p> <p><span>  torious  that,  for  several  weeks  after  as-</span><span>  sembling,  time  is  invariably  consumed  in</span><span>  debate,  and  that  it  is  only  lifter  discus-</span><span>  sion  has  become  wearisome  that  the</span><span>  practical  work  of  legislaipn  begins.</span><span>  Parliament  meets  on  Wednesday  next,</span><span>  the  24th  instant,  but  the  debite  on  the</span><span>  Governor's  Speech  will  probabV  occupy</span><span>  the  Assembly  during  that  an  the  fol-</span><span>  lowing  week.  It  is  scarcel)  possible</span></p> <p><span>  that  the  Redistribution  Bill  &lt;  tn  reach</span><span>  the  motion  for  a  second  readin|  until  the</span><span>  end  of  May.  The  discussion  at  hat  stage</span><span>  will  certainly  consume  four  Go  'cmment</span><span>  nights,  or  two  whole  weeks.  Then  a</span><span>  week  at  least  will  be  occttpic  i  on  the</span><span>  Budget.  The  end  of  June,  therefore,  will</span><span>  arrive  before  thc  Redistribution  Bill  gets</span></p> <p><span>  imo  Committee.  /There  it  will  be</span><span>  detained  at  least  three  weeks,  ir  all  goes</span><span>  well.  The  result  will  be,  either  its  coming</span><span>  into  operation  must  be  post-dated  for  a</span><span>  year,  which  means  t  YO  general  elections</span><span>  within  eighteen  n  onths,  or  special</span><span>  machinery  must  be  p  ovidedfor  preparing</span><span>  the  new  electoral  roils  We  repeat,  then,</span><span>  that  the  time  is  ino|  porlune  for  a  general</span><span>  measure  of  rcdistri  lulion  this  year,  and</span><span>  that  it  would  bein  ct  erv  way  belier  to  add</span><span>  a  few  members  lo  the  present  House</span><span>  and  prepare  for  a  pe  raanent  and  possibly</span><span>  self-acling  Rcpresi  illation  Jiill  imme-</span><span>  diately  after  the  laking  of  the  next</span><span>  census.

It  is,  in  fact,  in</span><span>  one  sense,  a  supplementary  statute</span></p> <p><span>  to  the  Local  Government  Act,  and</span><span>  supplies  a  well  known  defect  in</span><span>  the  law  of  the  colony  relating  to</span><span>  municipalities.  It  has  often  been  felt</span><span>  that  for  the  taking  of  lands  for  the</span><span>  making  of  new  streets  or  roads  or  the</span><span>  improvement  of  those  already  existing,</span><span>  or  for  constructing  sewers,  the  muni-</span><span>  cipal  authorities  should  not  be  left  to</span><span>  the  cupidity  or  caprice  of  the  owners  of</span><span>  private  land,  but  should  have  full  power</span><span>  to  take  lands  for  such  purposes  on  pay-</span><span>  ment  of  a  price  equivalent  to  their</span><span>  real  value.  The  present  Act  gives  this</span><span>  power,  and  must  therefore  be  considered</span><span>  a  valuable  addition  to  the  statute  book</span><span>  of  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  On  ¡ts  introduction  into  the  Legisla-</span><span>  tive  Assembly,  Mr.  Griffith  explained  that</span><span>  the  provisions  of  this  measure  are  similar</span><span>  to  those  of  statutes  recently  passed  in</span><span>  England,  and  in  several  of  the  colonies,</span><span>  and  that  it  is  a  measure  of  recognised</span><span>  utility.</span></p> <p><span>  Section  7  of  the  Act  provides  that</span><span>  when  the  constructing  authority  is  the</span><span>  Crown,  or  a  Municipal  Corporation,  no</span><span>  compensation  shall  be  payable  in  respect</span><span>  of  the  taking  of  any  Crown  lands  held</span><span>  under  pastoral  lease,  nor  shall  the  pro-</span><span>  visions  of  this  Act  relating  to  compensa-</span><span>  tion  extend  or  apply  to  any  such  case  ;</span><span>  but  compensation  shall  nevertheless  be</span><span>  payable  in  respect  of  any  permanent</span><span>  buildings,  reservoirs,  dams,  or  wells</span><span>  situated  upon  any  Crown  lands  so</span></p> <p><span>  taken.</span></p> <p><span>  The  third  part  deals  fully  with  the</span><span>  manner  in  which  lands  shall  bc  taken.</span><span>  Whenever  any  land  is  proposed  to  be</span><span>  taken  for  any  work  or  undertaking,  the</span><span>  constructing  authority  shall  cause  to  be</span><span>  prepared  a  map  or  plan  of  the  lands  pro-</span><span>  posed  to  be  taken  ;  and  also  a  book</span><span>  of  reference,  in  which  shall  bc;</span><span>  set  forth  a  description  of  tho</span><span>  ¡ands,  and  the  names  of  the  owners</span><span>  or  reputed  owners,  lessees  or  reputed</span><span>  lessees,  and  occupiers  thereof  so  far  as</span></p> <p><span>  the  same  shall  be  known,  or  can  with</span><span>  reasonable  diligence  lie  ascertained  ;</span><span>  with  a  description  of  the  lands,  setting</span><span>  forth  the  nature  and  quality  of  culti-</span></p> <p><span>  vation,  the  slate  of  thc  enclosures  (if  :</span><span>  any),  and  the  quantity  of  land  which</span><span>  may  be  required  for  the  purpose  of  the</span><span>  undertaking.

They  have</span><span>  been  so  accustomed  to  security  here  that  they</span><span>  congregate  in  large  numbers,  and  swim,  and</span><span>  dive,  and  fish  in  the  most  engaging  manner.</span><span>  If  some  persons  had  their  way,  however,  they</span></p> <p><span>  would  put  an  end  to  this  pretty  aquatic</span><span>  scene.  Four  persous  were  yesterday  summoned</span><span>  by  Mr.  J.  S.  Edgar,  Curator  of  the  Gardens,</span><span>  for  duck-shooting  last  Sunday  at  Murray's</span><span>  Lagoon.

The  closing  of  the</span><span>  baths  would  unquestionably  be  a  great  loss  to</span><span>  thc  tow  n  and  district,  and  we  trust  that  some</span><span>  arrangement  will  be  made  for  the  purchase  of</span><span>  the  property  complete,  and  for  the  baths  lwing</span><span>  keptopenand  permanently  established  in  Rock-</span><span>  hampton.

"<p><span>  ihe|||ov»tini|fttWctiu,</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  JULY  5,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  Tun  urgency  of  improved  means  of  tran-</span><span>  sit  in  the  Central  districts  was  never  more</span><span>  felt  than  now.  We  have  been  congratu-</span><span>  lating  ourselves  upon  the  rapid  growth  of</span><span>  railway  inrnmp.  have  been  anticipat-</span><span>  ing  that  the  carriage  difficulty  would  have</span></p> <p><span>  been  overcome  when  the  trains  ran</span><span>  through  to  the  Comet  ;  but  now  there  is</span><span>  a  partial  block  to  traffic,  because  while</span><span>  business  with  the  west  has  increased,  and</span><span>  the  railway  has  stimulated  settlement,</span><span>  there  has  been  no  corresponding  increase</span><span>  in  the  number  of  teams.  A  few  years</span><span>  ago  the  carriers  and  their  friends  were</span><span>  panic-stricken  lest  thc  railway  should</span><span>  supersede  the  dray  roads,  and  not  a  few</span><span>  teamsters  were  attracted  lo  thc  northern</span><span>  districts,  where  rates  were  naturally  high</span><span>  at  the  moment.  But  experience  teaches</span><span>  that  the  locomotive,  instead  of  superseding</span><span>  the  dray,  has  actually  augmented  the  dray</span><span>  traffic.  One  hundred  and  forty  miles  of</span><span>  the  distance  has  been  cut  off,  truly,  but</span><span>  the  rate  of  carriage  is  now  much  higher</span><span>  from  the  Comet  westward  than  five  years</span><span>  ago  it  was  from  Rockhampton.  The</span><span>  teamster  escapes  the  Gogango  Range,</span><span>  and  the  interminable  Dawson  and  Mac-</span><span>  kenzie  scrubs  ;  and  yet  he  gets  more  pay</span><span>  per  ton  for  the  shorter  distance  than</span><span>  when  these  formidable  obstacles  had  to</span><span>  be  encountered.  Formerly,  the  rate  of</span><span>  carnage  by  dray  from  Rockhampton  lo</span><span>  Blackall  ranged  at  from  £18  to  .£22</span><span>  per  ton.  This  week  carriers  demand</span><span>  £2$  per  ton  to  Blackall  from  the  Comet</span><span>  Terminus.  In  other  words,  the  old</span><span>  rate  averaged  ,¿""5  per  ton  per  100  miles,</span><span>  while  the  present  rate  demanded  is  equal</span><span>  to  over  ¿9  per  ton  per  too  miles.  To</span><span>  this  roust  be  added  a  railway  charge</span><span>  varying  from  £4  per  ton  for  flour  to  ¿j</span><span>  10s.  for  drapery,  which  brings  the</span><span>  total  carriage  from  Rockhampton  to</span><span>  Blackall-a  distance  of  425.  miles</span><span>  up  to  from  £32  to  .£35  10s.  per  ton.</span><span>  Large  quantities  of  merchandise  lie  in</span><span>  the  various  wholesale  stores  here  awaiting</span><span>  transit  at  a  slightly  lower  rate  than  that</span><span>  asked,  and  in  the  western  districts  it  is</span><span>  declared  that  the  nearer  the  railway</span><span>  approaches  the  more  severe  does  the</span><span>  carriage  tax  become.  Last  year  the</span><span>  high  charges  were  accounted  for  by</span><span>  marsupial  ravages  and  drought,  but  this</span><span>  year  thc  season  is  unusually  fine,  and  yet</span><span>  the  rate  bas  been  steadily  advancing  for</span><span>  months  past.  The  cause  of  course  is  a</span><span>  scarcity  of  teams,  in  consequence  of  the</span><span>  progress  of  western  settlement,  and  the</span><span>  demand  for  rations,  fencing  wire,  and</span><span>  other  requisites  in  the  formation  of</span><span>  stations  out  there.  The  present  is  there-</span><span>  fore  a  good  time  for  carriers,  and  they</span><span>  have  to  thank  the  railway  for  the  rich</span><span>  harvest  they  are  now  gathering.  With-</span><span>  out  the  railway  there  would  have  been</span><span>  no  inducement  to  reclaim  the  far  western</span><span>  country,  and  the  work  going  on  there</span><span>  even  now  is  justified  by  future  prospects</span><span>  rather  than  based  upon  calculations  of</span><span>  immediate  profit  and  loss.</span></p> <p><span>  The  carriage  question,  however,  is  be-</span><span>  coming  a  very  serious  drawback  to  in-</span><span>  terior  settlement.  The  only  advantage</span><span>  conferred  by  the  railway,  so  far,  is  the</span><span>  lessened  time  required  to  procure  sup-</span><span>  plies  from  and  transport  wool  to  -the</span><span>  coast.  But  this  is  poor  compensation</span><span>  for  the  increased  carriage  toll  of  sixty</span><span>  to  seventy-fire  per  cent,  which  has  to  be</span><span>  paid  for  up-loading.  That  the  price  will</span><span>  continue  to  advance,  or  even  remain  at</span><span>  the  existing  limit,  can  hardly  be  antici-</span><span>  pated.  Nor  ought  it  so  to  do.  The</span><span>  rates  are  considerably  beyond  the  re-</span><span>  munerative  point  to  the  carrier,  and  they</span><span>  are  paid  by  people  whose  distance  from</span><span>  the  seaboard  involves  at  best  heavy</span><span>  charges  upon  industry.  The  carriage  rates</span><span>  press  heavily  upon  all  inland  residents.</span><span>  They  are  paid,  not  by  the  distributors,</span><span>  but  by  Hie  producers  an.t  thc  bread-</span><span>  winners  in  their  employment,  and  they</span><span>  form  a  heavy  percentage  on  the  earnings</span><span>  as  well  as  thc  profits  of  the  pioneei</span><span>  colonists  who  are  engaged  in  turning  the</span><span>  western  wilderness  into  a  wealth-pro-</span><span>  ducing  country.</span></p> <p><span>  The  prospects  of  steadily  increasing</span><span>  business  on  our  inland  roads  ought  tc</span><span>  attract  carriers  from  other  parts  of  the</span><span>  colony,  and  also  induce  local  men  ol</span><span>  capital  to  invest  in  teams  and  drays.</span><span>  Here  is  scope  for  legitimate  enterprise,</span><span>  and  there  no  early  prospect  ol</span><span>  the  business  being  overdone.  The  rail</span><span>  way  will  continue  to  stimulate  the</span><span>  occupation  and  reclamation  of  the</span><span>  country,  which  must  be  accompanied  by</span><span>  a  constantly  increasing  demand  for  the</span><span>  means  of  transport.  There  seems  nc</span></p> <p><span>  reason  to  fear  a  return  to  the  unreniu</span><span>  nerative  carriage  rates  of  seven  or  eight</span><span>  years  ago,  for  then  little  confidence  was</span><span>  felt  in  the  pastoral  resources  of  the</span><span>  occupied  country.  Indeed,  the  sheep</span><span>  with  their  produce  were  so  inferior,  and</span><span>  home  prices  for  wool  were  so  exception-</span><span>  ally  depressed,  that  sheep-farming  could</span><span>  not  then  be  made  to  pay.  But  experi-</span><span>  ence  has  since  given  confidence,  and  the</span><span>  continually  expanding  demand  forwoollen</span><span>  goods  in  all  parts  of  the  world,  alfords  a</span><span>  guarantee  that  prices  will  not  again  fall</span><span>  for  any  lengthened  period  below  the  re-</span></p> <p><span>  munerative  limit.</span></p> <p><span>  As  an  indication  that  in  this  matter</span><span>  the  law  of  supply  and  demand  will</span><span>  ultimately  reduce  carriage  rates  lo  their</span><span>  normal  level,  it  may  he  mentioned</span><span>  that  Messrs.  Christian  and  Rivers</span></p> <p><span>  j  have  determined  to  remove  all  their</span></p> <p><span>  teams  from  the  Broadsound  road,  and</span><span>  seek  employment  for  then)  on  the  roads</span><span>  diverging  from  the  Comet  Railway  ter-</span><span>  minus.  As  this  firm  command  about</span><span>  sixty  teams-including  horses  and  bul-</span><span>  locks-they  ought  to  render  material</span><span>  assistance  in  meeting  the  demand  fur</span><span>  transport.  Hut  it  must  not  be  forgotten</span><span>  that  these  teams  are  not  additional  ones</span><span>  brought  into  the  district,  but  are  merely</span><span>  removed  from  one  road  to  another</span><span>  because  the  course  of  the  Peak  Downs</span><span>  traffic  has  been  shifted  by  the  railway.</span><span>  At  the  old  average  rates,  carriage  from  the</span><span>  Comet  to  Blackall  should  not  exceed</span></p> <p><span>  £15  per  ton  ;  but  so  far  as  can  be  at</span><span>  present  judged  the  prospect  is  distant  of</span><span>  a  reduction  to  that  limit.  And  should  a</span><span>  bad  season  occur  the  probability  is  that,</span><span>  even  with  many  additional  teams  placed</span><span>  upon  the  road,  the  rates  would  exceed</span><span>  those  now  current.  The  western  stations</span><span>  cannot  do  without  supplies,  and  they</span><span>  must  get  their  wool  conveyed  to  port.</span><span>  Carriers  may  therefore  look  forward</span><span>  pretty  confidently  to  a  long  continuance</span></p> <p><span>  of  remunerative  work.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Fitzroy  Lodge  of  Oood  Templars  meets</span><span>  this  evening  at  the  usual  hour  in  the  Protes-</span><span>  tant  Hall.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  seventeenth  monthly  meeting  of  the</span><span>  Rockhampton  Terminable  Building  Society</span><span>  No.  6,  was  held  at  the  Secretary's  office  last</span><span>  night.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  NOVEMBER  28,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  ___________________  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  THE  expedition  into  Afghanistan  has  be-</span><span>  gan  auspiciously,  and  the  British  troops</span><span>  are  advancing  in  two  directions  into  the</span><span>  Ameer's  dominions  with  uninterrupted  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  success.  The  threat  made  by  the  Ameer  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  that  he  would  roll  the  border  tribes</span><span>  against  the  British  invaders  like  blasts  of</span><span>  fire  turns  out  to  be  an  empty  boast,  as</span><span>  the  tribes  in  whom  he  professed  to  place</span><span>  his  trust  have  so far uniformly favoured</span><span>  the  British,  evidently  considering  them</span><span>  more  powerful  and  more  desirable  rulers</span><span>  than  Shere  Ali  and  his  subordinates.</span><span>  The  Continental  Press  express  much</span><span>  satisfaction,  we  are  told,  with  British</span><span>  successes;  and  this  feeling  is  only  natural,</span><span>  as  prompt  and  effective  action  by  the</span><span>  British  in  Afghanistan  imposes  a  whole-</span><span>  some  check  on  Russian  intrigue  and</span><span>  lessens  the  danger  of  the  little  war  which</span><span>  has  now  been  entered  upon  raising  fresh</span><span>  complications  in  Europe.  The  view</span><span>  taken  by  the  Russian  Government  of  the</span><span>  present  dispute  may  be  judged  from  the</span></p> <p><span>  utterances  of  the  Russian  Press.  The</span></p> <p><span>  St.  Petersburg  News  of  the  25th  Septem-</span><span>  ber  last,  stated  that  the  Russian Govern-</span><span>  ment  would  probably  not  interfere  in  the</span><span>  struggle  between  Shere  Ali  and  England.</span><span>  It  goes  on  to  say  : —</span></p> <p><span>  An  alliance  between  Afghanistan  and  Rus</span><span>  sia  is  indispensable  to  Shere  Ali,  who  desires</span><span>  to  feel  secure  as  regards  Russia  in  his  war</span><span>  with  England.  Such  an  alliance  by  no  means</span><span>  compromises  the  relations  between  Russia  and</span><span>  England.  Great  Britain  found  it  possible</span><span>  morally  to  support  Turkey  in  her  recent  war</span><span>  against  Russia.  In  London  it  was  considered</span><span>  requisite  to  bring  native  troops  from  India  to</span><span>  Europe,  which  is  in  itself  a  proof  that  Eng-</span></p> <p><span>  land  is  unable  without  foreign  aid  to  cope</span></p> <p><span>  with  Rusaia  on  land.  It  would  be  an  un-</span><span>  natural  and  thoroughly  senseless  piece  of  dis-</span><span>  interestedness  not  to  take  advantage  of</span><span>  such  an  occasion  for  the  purpose  of  giving</span><span>  Eastern  affairs  a  turn,  and  paralysing  the</span><span>  anti-Russian  clauses  introduced  into  the  Berlin</span><span>  Treaty  by  Count  Andrassy  and  Lord  Beacons-</span></p> <p><span>  field.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Nonve  Vresnya  of  same  date</span></p> <p><span>  says  :</span></p> <p><span>  The  English  Press  will  probably  either  urge</span><span>  the  disaffection  of  England's  numerous  Indian</span><span>  subjects  as  an  excuse  (or  putting  up  with  the</span><span>  insult,  or  it  will  advocate  a  war  with  Shere</span><span>  Ali.  In  either  case  the  situation  in  India</span><span>  removes  every  probability  of  Great  Britain's</span><span>  interference  with  the  results  of  the  Berlin</span><span>  Congress.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  short  extract  will  suffice.</span><span>  The  Golos  says  : —</span></p> <p><span>  It  will  excite  no  wonder  if  British dip-</span><span>  lomacy,  after  the  failure  of  its  Mission  to</span><span>  Afghanistan,  attempts,  for  the  purpose  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  distracting  Russia's  attention  from  England's  &nbsp;</span><span>  ""  sore  point,""  to  give  a  sharp  turn  to  all  the</span><span>  complications  that  have  of  late  arisen  on  the</span><span>  politics  of  Europe.</span></p> <p><span>  The  meaning  of  this  language  is  not</span><span>  to  be  mistaken.  Russia  having  been</span><span>  checked  in  her  schemes  of  aggrandise-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  in  Turkey  by  British  diplomacy,</span><span>  seeks  to  find  occupation  for  Great</span><span>  Britain  far  away  in  Asia,  so  as  to  render</span><span>  her  powerless  for  action  in  Europe.  &nbsp;</span><span>  Russia  is  therefore,  without  doubt,  at</span><span>  the  bottom  of  the  misunderstanding</span><span>  which  has  arisen  between  Great  Britain</span><span>  and  the  Ameer,  and  will  be  prepared  to</span><span>  assist  the  latter  as  circumstances  may</span><span>  warrant.  Direct  and  open  assistance</span><span>  would  not  be  possible  without  involving</span><span>  Russia  in  a  war  more  formidable  and</span><span>  dangerous  than  that  from  which  she  has</span><span>  just  emerged  ;  and  she  is  not  ready  for</span><span>  such  a  contingency.  Therefore  we  hear</span><span>  of  diplomatic  expressions  of  friendship</span><span>  from  the  Russian  Government  towards</span><span>  Great  Britain,  whilst  evidence  is  not  want-</span><span>  ing  that  Russia  is  secretly  playing  the  part</span><span>  of  an  enemy,  and  is  using  Shere  Ali  as  a</span><span>  mere  tool  to  favour  her  own  designs.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Pall  Mall  Gazette  strongly  con-</span><span>  demns  Earl  Beaconsfield  for  getting  up  &nbsp;</span><span>  a  little  war  with  the  Ameer,  and  urges</span><span>  that  Russia  is  the  real  enemy,  and  should</span><span>  be  grappled  with  in  a  direct  and  decisive</span><span>  manner.  But  we  doubt  the  wisdom  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  has  been  guilty  of  no  overt  act  of  hostility</span><span>  against  Great  Britain,  and  it  would  be</span><span>  only  playing  into  the  hands  pf  the  enemy</span><span>  for  the  British  Government  rashly  to</span></p> <p><span>  pick  a  quarrel  with  Russia  and  appeal  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  to  the  sword  for  a  settlement  of  all  out-</span><span>  standing  disputes.  This  extreme  course</span></p> <p><span>  is  scarcely  warranted  as  yet  and  there  is</span></p> <p><span>  still  hope  that  the  Berlin  Treaty  will  be</span><span>  carried  into  full  effect.  A  sharp  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  decisive  victory  in  Afghanistan, followed</span><span>  up  by  the  dismissal  of  Russian</span><span>  emissaries  from  Cabul,  would  completely</span><span>  foil  Russian  designs,  and  lead  to  an  un-</span><span>  reserved  and  complete  fulfilment  of  the</span><span>  conditions  imposed  upon  that  unscru-  &nbsp;</span><span>  pulous  Power  by  the  Treaty  of  Berlin.</span><span>  Hence  it  is  that  the  Continental  Press  &nbsp;</span><span>  rejoice  at  British  successes  in Afghanistan,</span><span>  as  they  are  calculated  to  have  a  power-</span><span>  ful  moral  influence  in  promoting  the</span><span>  peaceful Settlement of  the complications in  Turkey which are  causing so much  trouble and uneasiness throughout</span></p> <p><span>  Europe.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  But  a  short,  sharp,  and  decisive</span><span>  subjugation  of  Afghanistan  would  be  a</span><span>  stroke  of  good  fortune  which,  although</span><span>  quite  within  the  bounds  of  possibility,</span><span>  cannot  be  reckoned  upon  with anything</span><span>  approaching  to  certainty.  Practically,</span><span>  the  whole  of  Afghanistan  is  a  mass  of</span><span>  mountains  interspersed  with  valleys, and</span><span>  presents  difficulties  at  every  turn  to  the</span><span>  progress  of  an  array.  The  British  have</span><span>  occupied  Dhaka,  which  is  situated  at  the</span><span>  inner  extremity  of  the  Khybeer  Pass.</span><span>  The  whole  pass  is  therefore  now  in  their</span><span>  hands,  and  there  is  small  reason  to  fear that</span></p> <p><span>  they  will  be  unable  to  keep  it  open  for</span><span>  the  free  transmission  of  supplies. But</span><span>  the  forcing  of  the  pass  and  the  necessary</span><span>  construction  of  a  road  practicable  for</span><span>  wheeled  traffic  to  Cabul  can  only  be</span><span>  regarded  as  the  commencement  of  the</span><span>  difficulties  to  be  encountered  by  the</span><span>  expedition.  The  British  have  probably</span><span>  by  this  time  arrived  before  Jellalabad,</span><span>  and  if  it  be  true,  as  reported,  that  that</span><span>  fortress  is  to  be  evacuated  by  the</span><span>  Ameer's  troops,  and  that  the  inhabitants</span></p> <p><span>  are  ready  to  receive  our  soldiers  with  &nbsp;</span><span>  open  arms,  an  important  post  will  be  &nbsp;</span><span>  gained  without  a  struggle.  But  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  Koord  Kabul  Pass,  which  lies  between</span><span>  Jellalabad  and  Cabul,  is  a  formidable</span></p> <p><span>  position,  and  the  disastrous  retreat</span><span>  through  this  pass  of  the  British  expedi-</span><span>  tion  in  1839  will  not  soon  be  forgotten.</span><span>  But  the  experience  of  that  time  should</span><span>  be  a  warning,  and  we  have  no  doubt  that</span><span>  the  mistakes  then  made  will  be  carefully</span><span>  avoided  now.  There  will  surely  be</span><span>  taken  every  available  precaution  against</span><span>  reverses,  and  with  the  superior  advan-</span><span>  tages  we  possess  now  as  compared  with</span><span>  our  position  and  circumstances  in  former</span><span>  Afghan  campaigns  there  is  reason  to</span><span>  believe  that  the  conquest  of  the</span><span>  country,  will  not  be  very  difficult.</span><span>  In  1839  the  Punjaub  was  hostile</span><span>  territory;  it  is  now  friendly,  and</span><span>  under  British  control.  The  present  ter-</span><span>  minus  of  the  Punjaub  railway  system,</span><span>  with  which  it  is  connected  by  the  Grand</span><span>  Trunk  Road  {probably  one  of  the  very</span><span>  best  military  highways  in  the  world),  is</span><span>  within  170  miles  of  the  Khyber  Pass,</span><span>  and  the  facilities  for  keeping  up  com-</span><span>  munication  with  and  forwarding  supplies</span><span>  to  the  troops  in  Afghanistan,  are  conse-</span><span>  quently  much  greater  than  formerly.</span><span>  Grouped  around  this  railway  terminus,</span></p> <p><span>  or  between  it  and  the  Khyber,  are</span><span>  also  the  military  cantonments  of  Jhelum,</span><span>  Sealkote,  Tallagaon,  Rawul  Pindi,  Now-</span><span>  shera,  Abbottabad,  Hoti  Mardan,  Camp</span><span>  bellpora,  Peshawur,  and  Kohot,  and  it</span><span>  is  at  these  places  that  the  troops  were</span><span>  collected  in  readiness  for  the  expedition.</span><span>  It  will  therefore  be  understood  that  our</span><span>  troops  possess  immense  advantages  now</span><span>  as  compared  with  former  times  for  a suc-</span><span>  cessful  invasion  of  North-eastern</span><span>  Afghanistan.  They  are  also  in  a  far</span><span>  better  position  for  operating  in  the</span><span>  Southern  portion  of  the  Ameer's</span><span>  dominions,  the  possession  of  Quettah</span><span>  being  in  itself  a  great  source  of  strength.</span><span>  This  stronghold  is  situated  on  the</span><span>  north-western  frontier  of  Beloochistan.</span><span>  The  British  are  popular  there,  and</span></p> <p><span>  can  draw  a  plenteous  supply  of</span></p> <p><span>  recruits  from  the  Beloochis.  The</span><span>  prospects  would  therefore  on  the  whole</span><span>  seem  to  warrant  the  expectation  of  an  &nbsp;</span><span>  early  and  successful  termination  of  the</span><span>  present  war.  It  is  not  impossible  that</span><span>  a  dash  may  be  made  upon  Cabul  at</span><span>  once,  for  the  climate  and  time  of  year</span><span>  do  not  offer  an  insurmountable  obstacle.</span><span>  But,  in  any  case,  we  may  anticipate  that</span><span>  the  British  will  secure  for  themselves</span><span>  strong  strategic  posts,  from  which,  as  the</span><span>  spring  comes  on,  they  will  be  able  to</span><span>  strike  with  effect,  and  soon  be  in  a</span><span>  position  to  exact  from  the  Ameer  their</span></p> <p><span>  own  terms.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  public  meeting  last  night,  a  resolu-</span><span>  tion  introduced  at  the  last  moment  by  Mr.</span><span>  Rea,  was  adopted  without  dissent,  thanking</span><span>  Sub-Inspector  Collopy  and  the  police  under</span><span>  him  for  having  by  their  ""excellent  good</span><span>  sense  and  patient  good  humour  at  a  very</span><span>  trying  moment  saved  this  town  from</span><span>  a  very  serious  and  dangerous  outbreak</span><span>  of  public  indignation.  ""  The  mover said</span><span>  he  brought  forward  this  resolution  because  he  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  had  heard  that  at  a  meeting  of  justices  that</span></p> <p><span>  day,  the  stipendiary  magistrate,  Mr.Pugh,  &nbsp;</span><span>  read  a  telegram  which  he  had  drafted  to  send</span><span>  to  the  Government  severely  censuring  Sub-</span><span>  Inspector  Collopy  for  his  inaction  on  the</span><span>  occasion  referred  to,  and  recommending</span><span>  his  removal  for  that  reason.  It</span><span>  was  also  asked  by  the  speaker</span><span>  ""Where  was  the  Police  Magistrate  in  the</span><span>  time  of  danger?""  Did  he  give  any  instruc-</span><span>  tions?  If  not,  how  could  the  police  have</span><span>  failed  in  their  duty?  The  resolution,  as</span><span>  adopted  with  this  explanation,  was  intended</span><span>  to  exonerate  the  police  from  blame,  and  to  pass</span><span>  a  sweeping  censure  on  the  Police  Magistrate.</span><span>  But  this  was  uncalled  for.  The  Police  Magis-</span><span>  trate's  functions  are  judicial  in  their  character,</span><span>  and  we  scarcely  think  that  it  is  his  duty</span><span>  to  instruct  the  police  in  matters  with  regard</span><span>  to  which  they  are  already  instructed  as  cus-</span><span>  todians  of  the  peace.  It  is  generally  under-</span><span>  stood  that  judicial  and  executive  functions</span><span>  should,  where  practicable,  be  exercised  by</span><span>  different  individuals,  and  the  Police</span><span>  Magistrate  is  rather  to  be  commended</span><span>  than  blamed  for  leaving  the  police  to</span><span>  do  their  duty  in  their  own  way.  What</span><span>  Mr.  Pugh  really  did  say  will  be  found</span><span>  in  our  report  of  the  meeting  of  magistrates.</span><span>  That  Sub-Inspector  Collopy  deserved  censure</span></p> <p><span>  make  full  allowance  for  the  trying  position in</span><span>  which  he  was  placed,  but  we  contend  that he</span><span>  was  not  equal  to  the  emergency.  Had  he  at</span></p> <p><span>  the  first  display  of  unlawful  interference  &nbsp;</span><span>  with  the  mooring  of  the  vessel  promptly</span><span>  stepped  forward  with  his  men,  and  shown  by</span><span>  a  firm  but  conciliatory  bearing  that  the  law</span><span>  must  be  respected,  a  wholesome  check  would</span><span>  have  been  imposed  on  that  spirit  of  license  and</span><span>  rowdyism  which  afterwards  displayed  itself</span><span>  in  a  manner  injurious  to  the  cause  it  was</span><span>  intended  to  promote,  and  in  the  last  degree</span><span>  discreditable  to  an  order-loving  and  law</span><span>  abiding  community.  We  entirely  disapprove</span><span>  of  the  action  of  the  A.S.N.  Company,  and  the</span><span>  public  do  well  to  raise  a  protest  against  it,</span><span>  only  the  protest  to  be  effective  should  be  made</span><span>  in  an  orderly  and  peaceable  way.  There  was</span><span>  a  most  effective  demonstration  in  Brisbane  on</span><span>  Monday  last,  and  the  meeting  in  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  last  evening  was  quite  to  the  point  and</span><span>  showed  unmistakebly  the  feeling  of  the  com-</span><span>  munity  in  regard  to  the  attempt  of  the  Company</span><span>  to  substitute  Chinese  for  European  seamen.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  but  the  scene  on  the  wharf  on  Tuesday  was</span><span>  simply  disgraceful  and  cannot  be  defended.</span><span>  The  offenders  were  few  in  number,  and  were</span><span>  incited  to  break  the  law  by  men  who  should</span><span>  rather  have  set  an  example  as  good  citizens.</span><span>  And  the  conduct  of  those  persons  who  pro-</span><span>  vided  beer  gratuitously  for  all  who  chose  to</span><span>  take  it,  cannot  be  too  severely  censured.</span><span>  We  are  informed  on  the  best  authority  that</span><span>  during  Tuesday  night  two  of  the  warps  of  the</span><span>  Boomerang  were  cut,  and  stones  and  missiles</span><span>  of  all  kinds,  with  dead  fowls  and  other  refuse,</span><span>  were  thrown  in  large  quantities  on  the  deck</span><span>  of  the  steamer  to  the  annoyance  and  peril  of</span><span>  the  officers  and  crew,  while  she  lay  alongside</span><span>  the  wharf.  Conduct  such  as  this  the  respect-</span><span>  able  portion  of  all  classes  of  the  community</span><span>  must  condemn  and  regret.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  THERE  were  no  cases  for  hearing  at  the</span><span>  Police  Court  yesterday,  the  police  sheet  being</span></p> <p><span>  a  clean  one.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  annual  meeting  of  the  Rockhampton</span><span>  Building  Society,  No.  5,  will  be  held  at  the</span><span>  offices  of  the  Secretary  (Mr.  R.  L.  Dibdin)  to-</span><span>  night  at  eight  o'clock,  when  the  reports  of  the</span><span>  Directors  and  Auditors  together  with  the</span><span>  balance  sheet  will  be  presented  to  the  share-</span><span>  holders,  after  which  it  will  be  the  business  of</span><span>  the  meeting  to  elect  three  Directors  and  two</span><span>  Auditors.  &nbsp;</span><span>  THE  public  meeting  held  last  night,  to em-</span></p> <p><span>  press  an  opinion  on  the  action  of  the A.S.N.</span><span>  Company  in  employing  on  their  steamers</span><span>  Chinese  labour,  was  only  equalled  in  attend-</span><span>  ance  and  enthusiasm  by  the  largest  of  the</span><span>  election  meetings  lately  held.  In  order  to  do</span><span>  greater  justice  to  the  speakers,  we  withhold</span><span>  the  extended  report  of  the  meeting  until  to-</span><span>  morrow,  and  merely  give  the  resolutions  and</span><span>  the  speakers.  The  first  resolution,  moved  by</span><span>  Mr.  J.  Smith,  seconded  by  Mr.  Miller,  and</span><span>  carried  unanimously,  was  :—  ""That this meeting</span><span>  views  with  indignation  the  displacement  of</span><span>  British  seamen  in  the  A.S.N.  Co.'s  service  by</span><span>  Chinese.""  The  second  resolution  was  moved</span><span>  by  Mr.  G.  B.  Shaw,  seconded  by  Mr.  Rea,</span><span>  M.L.A.,  and  carried  amidst  great  enthusiasm.</span><span>  It  was  :  —""  That  considering  the  high  rates of</span><span>  freight  and  passage,  and  the  monopoly  of  trade</span><span>  enjoyed  by  the  A.S.N.  Company  in  Queens-</span></p> <p><span>  land  waters,  such  action  on  their  part  is</span><span>  altogether  unwarranted.  ""  The  next resolu-</span><span>  tion  was  moved  by  Mr.  A.  Feez,  seconded  by</span><span>  Kearney,  and  also  carried  unanimously  : —</span><span>  ""  That  this  meeting  freely  accords  the  right  of</span><span>  capital  or  accumulated  labour  to  use</span><span>  its  own  discretion  as  to  whom  it  shall</span><span>  employ  ;  yet  by  the  abuse  of  that  right,  when</span><span>  it  acts  injuriously  on  the  social  and  political</span><span>  interests  of  the  State,  demands  interference</span><span>  not  only  on  the  part  of  the  general  public,  but</span><span>  by  the  Government  of  the  country.  "" Mr.</span><span>  Milford  moved,  and  Mr.  Allen  seconded,  the</span><span>  next  resolution,  as  follows  :  —""  That this</span><span>  meeting  hereby  pledges  itself  to  dis-</span><span>  courage  such  action  on  the  part</span><span>  of  the  A.S.N.  Company  by  patro-</span><span>  nising  any  other  company  laying  on  steamers</span><span>  to  this  port  manned  by  British  seamen.""</span><span>  The  resolution  was  carried  amidst  great</span><span>  cheering.  The  last  resolution  was  moved  by</span><span>  Mr.  Rea,  seconded  by  Mr.  Bletchcr,  and</span><span>  carried  amidst  cheers:  —""That  this  meeting ten-</span><span>  ders  its  thanks  to  Mr.  Sub-lnspector  Collopy and</span><span>  the  police  force  under  his  charge  at  the  wharf</span><span>  on  the  26th  instant,  for  the  reason  that,  by</span><span>  his  and  their  excellent  good  sense  and  patient</span><span>  good  humour  at  a  very  trying  moment,  they</span><span>  saved  this  town  from  a  very  serious  and</span><span>  dangerous  outbreak  of  public  indignation.""</span><span>  A  vote  of  thanks  to  the  Mayor,  passed  with</span><span>  acclamation,  brought  the  meeting  to  a  close.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Committee  of  the  North  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  races  postponed  their  meeting  last  night</span><span>  until  this  evening,  when  it  will  be  held  at</span></p> <p><span>  Cusack's  Vîctoria  Hotel.  :</span></p> <p><span>  THE  annual  meeting  of  the  Rockhampton</span><span>  Cricket  Club,  convened  for  last  evening,  has</span><span>  been  adjourned  until  to-morrow  (Friday)</span><span>  evening,  at  the  same  time  and  place.</span></p> <p><span>  A  NOTIFICATION  at  the  Telegraph  Office</span><span>  states  that  communication  was  opened  with</span><span>  Duaringa  on  Tuesday.  The  railway  station</span><span>  master,  Mr.  C.  A.  Phillips,  is  in  charge</span><span>  of  the  newly-opened  telegraph  office.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  R.M.S.  Brisbane,  with  the  English</span><span>  mails  via  Torres  Strait,  having  left  Bowen</span><span>  yesterday  morning  at  half-past  two,  is  ex-</span><span>  pected  to  reach  the  Keppel  Bay  anchorage  at</span><span>  an  early  hour  this  morning,  and  the</span><span>  Victoria,  s.s.,  with  the  southern  mails, was</span><span>  due  in  the  Bay  last  night.  The  steam  tender</span><span>  Bunyip  left  the  wharf  last  night  at  ten  with</span><span>  a  full  complement  of  passengers  and  the</span><span>  southern and  northern mails  for transhipment to</span><span>  both  steamers.  The  two  seamen  employed  on</span><span>  the  Bunyip  struck  work  yesterday  afternoon,</span><span>  and  the  coaling  of  the  steamer  was  accom-</span><span>  plished  by  some  of  the  passengers,  assisted  by</span><span>  Mr.  A.  T.  Wood.  Sufficient  coal  was  taken</span></p> <p><span>  on  board  by  those  means  to  enable  the  Bunyip</span><span>  to  proceed  to  the  Bay,  where  her  scanty</span><span>  stock  will  be  replenished  by  the  s.s.  Victoria.</span><span>  The  Bunyip  is  expected  to  return  to  the  wharf</span><span>  about  four  o'clock  this  afternoon,  and  a  postal</span><span>  delivery  will  be  made  shortly  afterwards.  &nbsp;</span><span>  A  MEETING  of  the  Trustees  of  the  proposed</span><span>  Grammar  School  was  held  yesterday  after-</span><span>  noon,  at  four  o'clock.  There  were  present  :—</span><span>  Rev.  A.  Hay,  Dr.  Callaghan,  and  Messrs.  Mac-</span><span>  farlane,  W.  Pattison,  W.  G.  Jackson,  E.  P.</span><span>  Livermore,  and  H.  W.  Risien.  Mr.  Macfarlane</span><span>  was  appointed  Chairman  and  Mr.  Risien  Sec-</span><span>  retary  to  the  Trustees.  Mr.  Risien  moved  :</span><span>  —""That  the  Trustees  apply  to  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  for  the  reserve  bounded  by  Archer-</span><span>  street,  Cambridge-street,  Alma-street,  and</span><span>  Denham-street,  for  the  purpose  of  a  Boys'</span><span>  Grammar  School,  and  for  allotments  2,  3,  and</span><span>  4  of  section  24  for  the  purpose  of  a  Girls'</span></p> <p><span>  School.  The  motion  was  not  seconded.</span><span>  Mr.  Pattison  proposed,  and  Dr.  Callaghan</span><span>  seconded,  that  the  Trustees  apply  for  fifteen</span><span>  acrcs  on  the  Range  above  the  Orphanage.</span><span>  The  Chairman  and  Mr.  Livermore  supported</span><span>  the  motion,  and  on  putting  it  to  the  meeting</span><span>  it  was  carried,  Messrs.  Macfarlane,  Pattison,</span><span>  and  Dr.  Callaghan  voting  for  the  motion,  Mr.</span><span>  Risien  against  it,  and  Rev.  Mr.  Hay  and</span><span>  Mr.  Jackson  not  voting.  As  this  concluded</span></p> <p><span>  the  business,  the  Trustees  then  adjourned.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  proceedings  consequences  on  the  strike  &nbsp;</span><span>  of  the  A.S.N.  Co.'s  seamen  were  yesterday  of</span><span>  a  peaceable  character.  This  was  doubtless</span><span>  owing  to  the  prompt  and  energetic  measures  of</span><span>  the  magistrates  at  their  special  meeting,  their</span><span>  deliberations  being  reported  elsewhere.  About</span><span>  a  quarter  to  one  o'clock,  the  Boomerang  drew</span><span>  up  to  the  wharf,  and  after  some  time  was</span><span>  properly  moored,  no  one  caring  to  interfere.</span><span>  Twelve  constables  were  drawn  up  on  the</span><span>  wharf,  and  those  persons  who  might  have</span><span>  been  inclined  to  break  the  law  plainly  saw</span><span>  that  such  an  attempt  would  be  useless.  A</span><span>  few  angry  remarks  were  made  by  some  who</span><span>  had  taken  a  prominent  part  in  the  riotous</span><span>  proceedings  of  the  previous  day,  but  their</span><span>  words  failed  to  excite  the  crowd  in  the  face  of</span><span>  the  determined  attitude  of  the  police.  &nbsp;</span><span>  Detective  Long  was  keeping  a  close  look  out,</span><span>  and  Mr.  Manly,  of  the  Prince  of  Wales  Hotel,</span><span>  was  arrested  for  inciting  to  riotous  conduct.</span><span>  The  arrest  was  effected  peaceably,  and  it  then</span><span>  became  evident  that  no  attempt  would  he</span><span>  made  to  prevent  the  discharge  of  the  cargo.</span><span>  Two  other  arrests  were  made  throughout  the</span><span>  day,  drunkenness  having  perhaps  more  to do with</span><span>  their  misfortune  than  their  desire  to  interfere</span><span>  with  the  rights  of  property.  It  may  be</span><span>  mentioned  that  the  magistrates  were  present</span><span>  in  large  numbers,  and  their  presence  and  well</span><span>  known  opinions  tended  to  support  the</span><span>  police  in  exercising  their  just  authority.</span><span>  Mr.  Pugh,  P.M.,  addressed  a  few  words</span><span>  to  the  crowd,  stating  his  determination</span><span>  to  prevent,  at  all  risks,  any  illegal  violence.</span><span>  When  it  was  seen  that  there  would  be  no  dis-</span><span>  turbance,  the  assemblage  gradually  dispersed,</span><span>  and  the  work  of  discharging  was  carried  on.</span><span>  The  Agents  of  the  Company  were  quite</span><span>  willing  to  discharge  with  white  labour,  but  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  the  leaders  of  the  strikers  would  not  agree</span><span>  to  the  terms  proposed,  so  that  the  Chinese  had</span></p> <p><span>  necessarily  to  be  employed.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  A  SECOND  VICTORIAN  DELEGATION.  —It is</span><span>  currently  reported  (says  the  AGE  of November</span><span>  II)  that  if  the  Government  proposal  to  send</span><span>  a  delegation  to  England  to  confer  with  the</span><span>  Colonial  Secretary  upon  the  reform  question</span><span>  is  carried  out,  the  Opposition  also  intend  to</span><span>  send  home  representatives  to  state  their  views</span><span>  upon  the  subject.  Amongst  those  whose</span><span>  names  have  been  mentioned  as  being  likely  to</span><span>  be  asked  by  the  Opposition  to  proceed  to</span><span>  England  on  their  behalf  are  Mr.  Gillies,</span><span>  M.L.A.,  and  Mr.  Langton.</span></p> <p><span>  MR.  BROWN  AND  THE  NEW  BRITAIN  MAS-</span><span>  SACRE.  —Referring  to  the  New  Britain  massa-</span></p> <p><span>  cre,  and  the  Rev.  Mr.  Brown's  retaliation,  the</span><span>  Fiji  Times  says  :-  —Two  English  ships  of war</span><span>  have  visited  New  Britain,  and  the  captains  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  have  rigidly  investigated  the  whole  affair  in</span><span>  which  Mr.  Brown  was  engaged.  They  have</span><span>  met  natives  and  traders,  of  whom  they  made</span><span>  searching  inquiries  relative  to  the  matter.</span><span>  One  of  those  gentlemen  gave  Mr.  Brown</span><span>  full  permission  to  tell  anyone  that</span><span>  in  his  opinion  he  had  done  quite</span><span>  right,  and  had  saved  the  mission,  and  the</span><span>  lives  of  the  traders  as  well.  Mr.  Brown  has</span><span>  suffered  considerably  from  repeated  attacks  of</span><span>  fever  ;  but  a  cruise  for  three  weeks  in  one  of</span><span>  the  ships  of  war,  which the captain kindly invited</span><span>  him  to  take,  has  been  beneficial.  Mrs.  Brown,</span><span>  who  with  three  children  was  left  on  the  mis-</span><span>  sion  station,  suffered  no  annoyance  from  the</span><span>  natives  during  Mr.  Brown's  absence,  which</span><span>  clearly  showed  that  those  prophets  who  have</span><span>  predicted  nothing  but  evil  from  Mr.  Brown's</span><span>  expedition  last  April  will  probably  have  some</span><span>  misgivings  as  to  the  solidity  of  the  ground</span><span>  upon  which  they  have  stood.""  Eight  more</span><span>  native  teachers  of  Fiji  volunteered  to  go  to</span><span>  New  Britain,  and  are  probably  now  on  their</span><span>  way  to  join  Mr.  Brown.</span></p> <p><span>  LARGE  YIELD  OF  WOOL.  —Some excellent</span><span>  yields  of  wool  have  been  reported  this season.</span><span>  The  Dubbo  Dispatch  of  Friday  states  that</span><span>  among  the  sheep  recently  shorn  at  the  Murra-</span><span>  wombie  shed  (Messrs.  W.  and  T.  Richardson's)</span><span>  were  500  ewes,  which  cut  on  an  average  7  lbs.</span><span>  6  oz.  of  greasy  wool.  The  dirt  was  remarkably</span><span>  light,  nothing  like  the  usual  per-centage,  and</span><span>  hence  this  yield  must  be  considered  first-rate.</span><span>  The  sheep  have  been  bred  on  the  station,  and</span><span>  are  the  results  of  the  labours  for  years  of</span><span>  Messrs.  Richardson  to  produce  on  the  saltbush</span><span>  country  an  animal  in  every  sense  suited  to  the</span><span>  climate  and  soil  and  profitable  to  the  owner.</span><span>  In  their  efforts  to  gain  this  end,  they  have  gone</span><span>  to  work  on  an  intelligent  system,  and  in  working</span><span>  out  their  scheme  have  spared  neither  expense</span><span>  nor  trouble.  For  many  years  past  they  have pur-</span><span>  chased  at  long  prices  the  pick  of  the  Havilah</span><span>  and  Lowee  rams,  and  by  judicious  use  of  the</span><span>  animals,  a  liberal  culling  of  their  flocks,  and</span><span>  a  careful  consideration  of  the  results,  they</span><span>  have  now  been  able  to  shear  an  average  of</span><span>  7  lbs.  6  ozs.  of  clean  greasy  wool  from  a  flock</span><span>  of  5003  ewes—an  average  which  would  have</span><span>  reached  8  lbs.  if  the  season  from  last  shearing</span><span>  to  March  had  been  anything  like  it  has  been</span><span>  since.  Messrs.  Richardson  have  shown  very</span><span>  conclusively  that  while  it  is  impossible  to</span><span>  grow  the  very  fine  Mudgee  wool  in</span><span>  our  hot  saltbush  country,  that  a  marine</span></p> <p><span>  sheep  with  a  fleece  as  valuable  can</span><span>  be  produced.  The  saltbush  sheep,  as</span><span>  bred  by  the  proprietors  of  Murrowombie,  is  a</span><span>  large-framed  heavy  animal,  giving  a  large</span><span>  surface  to  be  shorn.  A  Mudgee  sheep  will</span><span>  cut,  perhaps,  in  the  grease  4  lbs.  of  wool  worth</span><span>  1s.  6d.  per  lb.  He  may  cut  2  lbs.  of  spout-</span><span>  washed  wool,  worth  3s.  6d.  per  lb.,  but  the</span><span>  saltbush  merino—the  Murrowombie  sheep</span><span>  will  cut  7  lbs.,  say,  of  greasy  wool  at  1s.  per</span><span>  lb.  or  4  lbs.  of  washed  wool  at  1s.  10d.  per</span><span>  lb.

Two  of  the  members</span><span>  of  the  club,  Messrs.  Cape  and  Deloitte,</span><span>  were  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Brothers'</span><span>  Rocks,  late  in  the  afternoon,  when  they</span></p> <p><span>  noticed  a  disturbance  on  the  surface  of  the</span><span>  clear  shining  river,  close  to  the  above-named</span><span>  spot,  and  it  was  apparent  that  something  was</span><span>  making  across  the  river  in  the  direction  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  club's  boat-house.  T  he  occupants  of  the boat</span><span>  put  the  Plimsoll  in  chase,  and  after  some</span><span>  vigorous  rowing,  they  came  close  enough  to</span><span>  descry  an  immense  snake,  which  now  and</span><span>  again  reared  its  forebody  out  of  the  water</span><span>  about  two  feet  as  if  to  take  its  bearing,  and</span><span>  it  swam  along  in  beautiful  style,  its  bright</span><span>  colours  of  pea-green  and  yellow  glinting</span><span>  beautifully  in  the  clear  aunlight.  As  the</span><span>  chase  continued  his  snakeship  turned  to  go</span><span>  down  the  river,  and  the  only  weapon  on  board</span></p> <p><span>  the  Plimsoll  was  several  times  aimed  at  it,</span><span>  but  a  boat's  stretcher  being  about  as  awkward</span><span>  a  missile  as  one  could  hurl,  it  fell  wide  of  its</span><span>  mark.  Once  the  reptile  turned  and  violently</span><span>  bit  the  stretcher.  These  stoppages,  however,</span><span>  threw  the  pursuers  astern  in  the  chase.  When</span></p> <p><span>  close  to  the  Black  wall  the  snake  was  rowed</span></p> <p><span>  down,  but  being  ""cornered,""  and  finding</span><span>  liberty  hopeless,  it  turned  suddenly  and  faced</span><span>  its  pursuers  with  head  reared  and  jaws  dis-</span><span>  tended,  evincing  a  strong  inclination  to  ""go</span><span>  for  ""  its  pursuers.  It  looked,  however,  as  if</span><span>  the  tables  were  about  to  turn,  judging  by  the</span><span>  rapid  retreat  of  the  Plimsoll.  The  snake</span><span>  again  made  off,  and  the  boat  getting  close</span><span>  upon  him,  a  blow  from  the  stretcher  put  an</span><span>  end  to  the  excitement,  and  the  captive  quietly  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  submitted  to  be  hauled  on  board,</span></p> ",Article,1878-11-28,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

He  says  :-""  Now  I</span><span>  have  sailed  the  lentil  of  the  Australian  coast</span><span>  in  the  vessels  nf  tlic  A.S.N.  Co.

Never,</span></p> <p><span>  eave  once,  have  I  taken  such  a  wretched</span><span>  voyage  in  these  colonies.  On  that  occasion  I</span><span>  was  bound  northwards  from  Rockhampton.</span><span>  Thc  exigencies  of  the  origin  and  existence  of</span><span>  that  city  placed  it  many  miles  up  the  Fitzroy</span><span>  Uiver,  the  most  dismal  perhapB  in  Queensland.</span><span>  It  is  almost  a  day's  journey  from  the  mouth</span><span>  before  one  arrives  at  the  town,  unless  you</span><span>  happen  to  get  stuck  on  a  sand  bank.  Let  it</span><span>  be  understood  by  all  concerned  that  I  am  not</span><span>  saying  one  word  against  Rockhampton,  or  thc</span><span>  '  large-hearted  pioneers  of  the  North,'  as  its</span><span>  inhabitants  were  styled,  although  with  the</span><span>  march  of  progress  and  thc  foundation  of  so</span><span>  many  future  capitals  of  thc  next  established</span><span>  colony,  it  is  uow  very  far  soutli  indeed.

Co.  navigating  thc  Flats  of</span><span>  the  Fitzroy.  So  passengers  to  and  from</span><span>  Rockhampton  arc  conveyed  in  a  horrid</span><span>  little  tender  called  the  Jîunyip.  This,  I</span><span>  believe,  is  thc  title  of  an  extinct  or  fabulous</span><span>  Australian  animal.  I  don't  want  to  see  it</span></p> <p><span>  after  an  experience  of  its  namesake.  It  was  a</span><span>  Sunday  afternoon  ;  tho  Bunyip  started  at  2</span><span>  o'clock  to  meet  the  Leichhardt  in  Keppel  Bay.</span><span>  There  was  a  crowd  on  board,  including  many</span><span>  ladies,  for  whom  not  thc  sUghtcst  accommoda-</span><span>  tion  was  provided.  Except  that  wc  were</span><span>  cramped  for  room,  there  was  not  at  first  much</span><span>  to  complain  of.  We  tried  to  find  natural</span><span>  beauties  on  thc  banks,  and  failed.  The  one</span><span>  object  of  interest  was  when  wc  passed</span><span>  certain  islands,  and  thc  captain  blowing  thc</span><span>  steam  whistle,  thc  air  was  soon  darkenod  with</span><span>  (lying  foxes.  They  were  also  seen  banging  on</span><span>  tho  branches  in  clusters  like  swarming  bees.</span><span>  It  is  quite  a  sight  to  show  a  new  chum.  Then</span><span>  we  had  tea.  Thc  steward  was  a  cabin</span><span>  boy  with  one  eye,  au  original  whom</span><span>  Dickens  would  have  rejoiced  in,  os  I</span><span>  did.  Wo  had  cold  meat,  and  ham,  and</span><span>  pickles,  and  sardines,  and  other  nice  things  ;</span><span>  and  there  was  also  jam,  raspberry.  One  of</span><span>  our  passengers  was  a  young  gentleman,  be-</span><span>  longing  to  the  people.  Now,  all  over  thc</span><span>  world  I  have  noticed  that  Jews  arc  very  bad</span><span>  sailors  ;  they  suffer  torments.  It  was  once</span><span>  suggested  to  me  that  the  reason  thc  waters  of</span><span>  the  Red  Sea  were  rolled  bock,  and  thc</span><span>  Israelites  passed  tlirough  on  dry  land,  wras</span><span>  tbatif  they  had  sailed  overthoy  would  have  been</span><span>  so  prostrated  by  sea  sickness  as  to  bc  an  easy</span><span>  Ïircy  to  the  Egyptians.  Well,  our  young</span><span>  lehrew  made  a  hearty  meal,  and  went  in</span><span>  heavily  fortho  raspberry  jam.  I  watched  him</span><span>  with  interest.  'That  will  fetch  him,'  I</span></p> <p><span>  thought,  and  shortly  it  did.  When  he  got</span><span>  into  Keppel  Bay  the  scene  was  awful.  Bodies</span><span>  were  lying  around  in  a  fashion  which  only</span><span>  Gustave  Dore  could  paint.  Our  friend  was</span><span>  the  worst  of  all.  I  sat  right  over  the  screw</span><span>  with  s  'curions  sanitaire'of  ropes  around</span><span>  me.  Tims  wc  tossed  about  until  after  nine</span><span>  o'clock  when  the  Leichhardt  was  sighted,  and</span><span>  all  were  released  from  their  temporary  pur-</span><span>  gatory.""</span></p> ",Article,1878-09-12,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  JANUARY  29,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  OUR  English  files  contain  the  report  of  a</span><span>  lecture  by  Professor  Huxley  on  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  ""  Technical  Education.""  It  was de-</span></p> <p><span>  livered  on  the  30th  November  last,</span><span>  under  the  auspices  of  the  Working  Men's  &nbsp;</span><span>  Club  in  London,  and  must  have  been  an</span><span>  intellectual  treat  to  the  audience  of  no</span><span>  ordinary  character.  The  Professor,  how-  &nbsp;</span><span>  ever,  appears  to  us  to  be  rather  un-  &nbsp;</span><span>  practical  in  his  suggestions,  and  to  have  &nbsp;</span><span>  shed  little  light  on  the  vexed  question,</span></p> <p><span>  how  to  give  lads  under  thirteen  years  of</span><span>  age  such  technical  instruction,  in  addition  &nbsp;</span><span>  to  the  usual  English  education,  as  will  &nbsp;</span><span>  be  of  real  service  to  them  in  the  battle  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  of  life.</span></p> <p><span>  Professor  Husky  starts  by  a  happy</span><span>  definition  of  the  subject  of  his  lecture.</span><span>  ""  He  understood  by  technical education</span><span>  the  training  best  fitted  for  those  who</span><span>  practise  handicrafts—it  other  words,  it</span><span>  was  the  teaching  of  handicrafts.  Strip-</span><span>  ping  it  of  its  Greco-Latin  form,  that  was</span><span>  the  plain  English  of  the  expression  &nbsp;</span><span>  technical  education.  It  answered  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  artisan's  question,  What  ought  I  know  in</span><span>  order  to  practise  my  handicraft  best  ?""  &nbsp;</span><span>  He  then  proceeded  to  explain  what  is</span><span>  handicraft,  and  says  he  as  an  anatomist</span><span>  has  practised  a  handicraft  for  thirty  years  &nbsp;</span><span>  of  his  working  life.  On  this  ground  he</span><span>  claims  to  be  a  handicraftsman,  but  this,  &nbsp;</span><span>  we  fear,  is  a  non-natural  definition  of  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  word  handicraft,  which,  is  ordinarily</span><span>  understood  to  mean  ""  manual  occupa-  &nbsp;</span><span>  tion  ;  work  performed  by  the  hand  ""  &nbsp;</span><span>  The  lecturer  caused  some  amusement  by</span><span>  remarking  that  ""  his  handicraft  was  &nbsp;</span><span>  anatomy—a  form  of  practical  industry  &nbsp;</span><span>  requiring  great  skill  of  hand  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  accuracy  of  eye.  He  ventured  to  say</span><span>  that  if,  for  the  nonce,  he  were  to  ex-  &nbsp;</span><span>  change  handicrafts  with  a  watch-</span><span>  maker  who  should  bring  him  a</span><span>  watch  to  mend,  the  watchmaker</span><span>  being  set  by  himself  to  dissect  the</span><span>  nervous  system  of  a  beetle,  he  should  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  have  no  fear  of  coming  off  second best</span><span>  in  the  competition."" The Professor</span><span>  takes questionable ground  here, for in</span></p> <p><span>  dissecting beetles  he is  engaged in an</span></p> <p><span>    &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  intellectual  occupation  for  scientific</span><span>  purposes,  whereas  the  watchmaker</span><span>  practises  his  craft  with  no  such  intent.</span><span>  One  is  in  the  pursuit  of  knowledge,  the</span><span>  other  labouring  for  bread-and-cheese.</span><span>  Both  are  working  men,  but  we  do  not</span><span>  think  the  philosophical  anatomist  is  in</span><span>  any  sense  a  handicraftsman.  This</span><span>  misapprehension  on  the  part  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  lecturer  probably  is  accountable  for  his</span><span>  failure  to  give  practical  advice  on  the  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  subject.  Yet  much  that  he  says  is  good.</span><span>  He  objects  to  standards  of  education</span><span>  and  competitive  exanimations.  The  &nbsp;</span><span>  pupil  should  have  some  instruction  in  &nbsp;</span><span>  physical  science,—""  rudimentary  but</span><span>  good  and  sound,  so  far  as  it  went,  of  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  properties  and  character  of  natural  &nbsp;</span><span>  objects.""  He  would  have  everybody</span><span>  draw,  not  perfectly,  perhaps,  but  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  same  sense  as  everybody  writes.  The  &nbsp;</span><span>  pupil  should  know  one  or  two  languages</span><span>  besides  his  own,  that  he  might  know  what</span><span>  other  nations  were  doing,  and  have</span></p> <p><span>  sources  of  information  which  would  be</span><span>  otherwise  sealed  to  him.  But  how  one  &nbsp;</span><span>  or  two  languages  could  be  taught  to  a  &nbsp;</span><span>  lad  who  leaves  school  at  thirteen,  in  ad-</span><span>  dition  to  the  ordinary  English  education,  &nbsp;</span><span>  is  not  clear  ;  nor  is  such  instruction  neces-</span><span>  sary  to  the  handicraftsman  now  that  trade  &nbsp;</span><span>  journals  provide  him  with  translations  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  foreign  technical  publications.  The  &nbsp;</span><span>  Professor  ""  would  earnestly  desire  that  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  pupil  should  have  kept  in  all  its</span><span>  bloom  the  freshness  and  youthfulness  of</span><span>  his  mind,  all  the  vigour  and  elasticity  &nbsp;</span><span>  proper  to  that  age,  and  that  this  fresh-  &nbsp;</span><span>  ness  and  vigour  should  not  have  been  &nbsp;</span><span>  washed  out  of  him  by  the  incessant</span><span>  labour  and  intellectual  debauchery  often</span><span>  involved  in  grinding  for  examinations.</span><span>  Everybody  must  have  noticed  that  in</span><span>  these  days  men  are  often  called  on  to</span><span>  use  the  callow  brain  before  it  is  properly</span><span>  set.""  But  there  is  something  to  be  said</span><span>  in  favour  of  examinations,  nevertheless.</span><span>  Some  test  must  be  applied  when  unusual</span><span>  ability  is  sought  for  ;  and  as  success  in life</span><span>  is  as  much  dependent  upon  assiduity</span><span>  and  staying  power  as  on  natural  ability,</span><span>  competition  though  sometimes injurious</span></p> <p><span>  to  the  student  is  more  often  beneficially  &nbsp;</span><span>  stimulating.  Beyond  drawing  and</span><span>  languages,  the  Professor  would  not  desire  &nbsp;</span><span>  any  addition  to  the  present  English</span><span>  primary  school  training  for  a  pupil  in-  &nbsp;</span><span>  tended  to  practise  a  handicraft.  ""  He  &nbsp;</span><span>  contrasted  the  schools  of  the  present  &nbsp;</span><span>  day  with  those  of  forty  years  ago,  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  said  the  result  of  the  comparison  was  &nbsp;</span><span>  such  as  to  fill  one  of  his  own  age  with  a</span><span>  sense  of  depression  and  envy  at  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  immense  advantages  enjoyed  by  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  youth  of  the  present  generation.  Still,  &nbsp;</span><span>  there  were  some  respects  in  which  the</span><span>  present  national  system  of  education</span><span>  might  be  improved.  Elementary  science  &nbsp;</span><span>  was  taught  but  by  drops.  *  *  Another</span><span>  thing  needing  reform  was  that such science</span><span>  teaching  as  was  given  was  not  always</span><span>  practical  and  experimental  enough,</span><span>  which,  though  it  might  be  attended  with</span><span>  some  trouble  and  expense,  was  yet  very</span><span>  necessary.  Perhaps,  too,  the  system</span><span>  tended  to  foster  in  some  teachers  a</span><span>  practice  analogous  to  what  sportsmen</span><span>  stigmatized  as  pot-shooting.  Upon  the</span><span>  whole,  however,  their  educational</span><span>  machinery  was  working  well,  as  a  whole,  &nbsp;</span><span>  and  they  might  almost  be  ready  to  con-  &nbsp;</span><span>  gratulate  themselves  on  seeing  such  a</span><span>  Utopian  state  of  things.  The  Univer-  &nbsp;</span><span>  sities  and  public  schools  had  accom-</span><span>  plished  much,  and  even  the  popularization  &nbsp;</span><span>  of  science  was  proceeding  at  such  a  rate  &nbsp;</span><span>  that  by  the  process  called  distillatio  per</span><span>  ascensum,  distillation  upwards,  he  looked</span><span>  forward  to  the  time  when  there  should</span><span>  be  no  member  of  Parliament  who  would  &nbsp;</span><span>  not  know  as  much  of  science  as  a  scholar</span><span>  in  one  of  our  elementary  schools.""  *  *  &nbsp;</span><span>  There  should  undoubtedly  be  some  &nbsp;</span><span>  machinery  for  utilising  in  the  public  &nbsp;</span><span>  interest  special  talent  and  genius  brought  &nbsp;</span><span>  to  light  in  our  schools.  If  any  Govern-  &nbsp;</span><span>  ment  could  find  a  Watt,  a  Davy,  or  a</span><span>  Faraday  in  the  market,  the  bargain  would  &nbsp;</span><span>  be  dirt  cheap  at  £  100,000.  He  should</span><span>  still  like,  as  he  had  said  when  he  was  a</span><span>  member  of  the  London  School  Board,  to  &nbsp;</span><span>  see  a  ladder  by  which  a  child  could  &nbsp;</span><span>  climb  from  the  gutter  to  the  highest  &nbsp;</span><span>  position  in  the  State.  There  should  be  &nbsp;</span><span>  some  system  by  which  any  boy  of</span><span>  special  aptitude  should  be  encouraged  to  &nbsp;</span><span>  prolong  his  studies,  to  join  art  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  science  classes,  and  be  apprenticed,  with</span><span>  with  a  premium  if  necessary.  As  for  &nbsp;</span><span>  those  who  showed  great  fitness  for  &nbsp;</span><span>  intellectual  pursuits,  they  might  be  trained</span><span>  as  pupil-teachers,  brought  to  London,</span><span>  and  placed  in  some  collegiate institution</span><span>  or  training  school.""</span></p> <p><span>  Professor  Huxley  concluded  by  &nbsp;</span><span>  announcing  that  the  ""  Livery Companies</span><span>  of  the  city  of  London  ""  had been</span><span>  seeking  information  how  best  they  might</span><span>  devote  their  great  resources  to  the</span><span>  education  of  handicraftsmen.  As  such,  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  they  had  taken  the  best  advice  available,  &nbsp;</span><span>  and  an  executive  committee  would  shortly  &nbsp;</span><span>  take  into  consideration  the  best  means  &nbsp;</span><span>  of  taking  steps  to  obtain  the  desired</span><span>  end.""  This  certainly  gives  a  practical</span><span>  turn  to  the  lecture,  and  we  have  no</span><span>  doubt  the  people  of  Australia  will  watch</span><span>  the  experiment  about  to  be  made  in</span><span>  London  with  very  great interest.</span></p> <p><span>  THERE  were  no  cases  for  hearing  at  the</span><span>  Police  Court  yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  meeting  of  the  Rockhampton share-</span><span>  holders  in  the  New  Peak  Downs  Copper</span><span>  Mining  Company,  held  yesterday  afternoon,</span></p> <p><span>  to  consider  what  steps  should  be  taken  with</span><span>  respect  to  the  forthcoming  meeting  at  Copper-  &nbsp;</span><span>  field  on  the  7th  February,  it  was  resolved  by  &nbsp;</span><span>  seventeen  to  five  that  the  registered  office  of</span><span>  the  Company  be  placed  at  Copperfield.  This  &nbsp;</span><span>  is  a  decision  of  which  we  thoroughly  approve,</span><span>  and  now  all  preliminary  difficulties  have  been  &nbsp;</span><span>  arranged,  it  may  be  hoped  that  the  business  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  Company  will  go  swimmingly.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  We  are  indebted  to  the  courtesy  of  Mr.</span><span>  O.  G.  Langley,  our  telegraph  station-master,  &nbsp;</span><span>  for  the  following  memo  re  cable  interruption  :  &nbsp;</span><span>  "" Batavia  : Superintendent  of Eastern Extension</span><span>  Telegraph  Company  ;  Telegraph  with Singapore-</span><span>  Batavia  cable  worked  badly  for  some  days</span><span>  prior  to  interruption  ;  repairing  ship  Edin-</span><span>  burgh  was  on  way  from  Rangoon  to  Singapore,</span><span>  and  communication  will  be  restored  in  about</span><span>  a  week  ;  steamers  arrive  at  Batavia  from  &nbsp;</span><span>  Singapore  on  3rd,  6th,  17th,  and  20th  &nbsp;</span><span>  February,  but  many  local  steamers  are  sure  to  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  arrive  between  those  dates.''  According  to  &nbsp;</span><span>  this  information,  we  need  not  expect  to  have  &nbsp;</span><span>  direct  news  from  Europe  for  about  a  week  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  from  this  date,  unless  by  a  chance  steamer.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  This  is  not  a  little  tantalising,  but  it  is  only  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  by  repeated  pinches  the  shoe  that  the  Aus-  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  tralian  colonies  will  be  induced  to  unite  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  purpose  of  securing  a  duplicate  cable.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  promoters  of  last  night's  meeting  ought  &nbsp;</span><span>  to  be  gratified  with  the  success  attained.</span><span>  There  was  not  a  large  attendance,  but  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  assemblage  was  composed  of  men  who  had  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  cause  of  education  at  heart,  and  who,  we  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  believe,  will  show  by  the  liberality  of  their</span></p> <p><span>  subscriptions  that  they  mean  to  have  the</span><span>  Grammar  School  established  forthwith. There</span><span>  was  just  one  little  difficulty,  namely,  the</span><span>  choice  of  a  Committee.  Mr.  Livermore's</span><span>  motion  provided  for  their  selection  by</span><span>  ballot.  This  was  deemed  a  needlessly  trouble-</span><span>  some  mode  of  proceeding,  and  after  &nbsp;</span><span>  some  delay  Mr.  Melbourne  opportunely  cut</span><span>  the  knot  by  naming  seven  gentlemen,  who</span><span>  were  unanimously  appointed  by  the  meeting.</span><span>  The  committee  chosen  is  an  unquestionably  &nbsp;</span><span>  good  one,  but  the  preparation  of  ballot  papers</span><span>  supplies  a  conclusive  answer  to  any  captious  &nbsp;</span><span>  person  who  might  accuse  the  promoters  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  having  the  committee  ""  cut  and  dried  "" before-</span><span>  hand.  In  matters  of  this  kind  too  much  care</span><span>  can  hardly  be  taken  to  avoid  the  breath  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  suspicion  of  cliquism,  for  the  establishment  &nbsp;</span><span>  of  a  grammar  school  needs  ""a  long  pull,  a  &nbsp;</span><span>  strong  pull,  and  a  pull  all  together.""  What</span><span>  the  Committee  should  aim  at  is  to  carry  out  &nbsp;</span><span>  Mr.  Livermore's  suggestion—the  founding  of  a  &nbsp;</span><span>  girls'  as  well  as  boys'  school.  To  do  this  they  &nbsp;</span><span>  must  obtain  liberal  aid  from  all  classes  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  creeds.  Rockhampton  has  already  won  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  reputation  of  always  carrying  out  public  &nbsp;</span><span>  movements  well.  We  are  confident,  then,</span><span>  that  in  this  matter  of  the  grammar  school  the</span><span>  vigour  exhibited  will  be  such  as  to  consolidate  &nbsp;</span><span>  that  reputation.</span></p> <p><span>  A  PUBLIC  meeting,  convened  at  the request</span></p> <p><span>  of  eighty  rate-payers,  was  held  last  night  at</span><span>  the  School  of  Arts,  to  consider  the  desirability</span><span>  of  establishing  a  Grammar  School  in  Rock-</span><span>  hampton,  His  Worship  the  Mayor  (Mr.</span><span>  W.  G.  Jackson)  presided,  and  opened  the</span><span>  meeting  by  reading  the  requisition.  The  first</span><span>  resolution  affirming  the  desirability  of</span></p> <p><span>  taking  immediate  steps  to  secure  the</span></p> <p><span>  object  in  view,  was  moved  by  the</span><span>  Rev.  Alexander  Hay,  M.A.,  seconded</span><span>  by  Mr.  L.  Sandel,  and  carried  unanimously.</span><span>  The  second  resolution,  which  was  moved  by</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  E.  P.  Livermore,  seconded  by  Mr.  W.  J.  &nbsp;</span><span>  Taylor,  and  carried,  ran  as  follows  :—"" That</span><span>  a  Committee  of  seven  gentlemen  be  now</span><span>  appointed  for  the  purposes  of  creating  a fund,</span><span>  opening  communication  with  the  Minister  for  &nbsp;</span><span>  Public  Instruction,  carrying  out  all  neces-  &nbsp;</span><span>  sary  preliminares  to  the  appointment  of  per-</span><span>  manent  Trustees.""  On  the  motion  of</span><span>  Mr.  Melbourne  seconded  by  Mr.  J.  Fer-</span><span>  guson,  the  following  gentlemen  were  appointed</span><span>  a  committee,  to  carry  out  the  objects  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  resolution,  viz.,  Messrs.  W.  G.  Jackson</span><span>  (Mayor),  J.  Macfarlane,  M.L.A.,  T. Archer,</span><span>  E.  P.  Livermore,  W.  Pattison,  Rev.  Alexander</span></p> <p><span>  Hay,  M.A.,  and  C.  H.  Buzacott.  The third</span><span>  and  last  resolution  proposed  by  Mr. Mel-</span><span>  bourne,  seconded  by  H.  Macdermott, and</span><span>  carried  was  as  follows  :—""  That  the  Com-</span><span>  mittee  be  requested  to  report  upon the</span><span>  suitability  or  otherwise  of  the  Grammar</span><span>  School  Reserve  ;  to  ascertain  whether  a</span><span>  better  site  is  obtainable  or  not;  and  to  con-</span><span>  vene  a  meeting  of  subscribers  on  an  early  day</span><span>  for  the  consideration  of  such  report."" A vote</span><span>  of  thanks  to  the  Mayor  for  presiding  brought</span><span>  the  proceedings  to  a  close.  A  full  report  will</span><span>  appear  in  to-morrow's  Bulletin.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  VICTORIAN  CRISIS.—Our  Melbourne</span></p> <p><span>  correspondent  informs  us  (says  the  Evening</span><span>  News)  that  orders  have  been  sent  home  by  the</span><span>  leading  mercantile  firms  in  Melbourne  to  stop</span><span>  all  further  shipments  of  goods  to  Victoria,  and</span><span>  we  learn  from  a  private  source  that  many  of</span><span>  them  discharged  a  number  of  their  hands  on</span><span>  Saturday  evening,  intending,  so  long  as  the</span><span>  present  storm  lasts,  to  reduce  the  establish-</span><span>  ments  to  the  lowest  workable  limits.  This  is</span><span>  no  more  than  might  have  been  expected, and</span><span>  the  agony  will,  no  doubt,  be  piled  up  all over</span><span>  the  colony,  until  ruin  stares  every  man  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  face.</span></p> <p><span>  FURTHER  TELEPHONE  EXPERIMENTS.— Ano-</span></p> <p><span>  ther  test  of  the  power  of  the  telegraph  wire</span><span>  to  conduct  sound  was  made  on  Saturday  by  &nbsp;</span><span>  Mr.  Cracknell  and  Mr.  Kopsch.  The  experi-</span><span>  ments  were  condnctcd  between  Sydney  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  West  Maitland,  over  140  miles  of  wire,  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  they  were  highly  successful.  Mr.  Cracknell  &nbsp;</span><span>  was  stationed  at  Maitland,  and  Mr.  Kopsch  &nbsp;</span><span>  and  Mr.  Dalgarno  remained  at  the  head  office.  &nbsp;</span><span>  The  sounds  were  transmitted  with  great  clear-  &nbsp;</span><span>  ness  and  distinctly  heard  between  the  two  &nbsp;</span><span>  stations.  Four  different  songs  were  sung  at</span><span>  the  head  station,  and  the  name  of  each  was  &nbsp;</span><span>  stated  from  the  receiving  end.  This  is  the   </span><span>  longest  circuit  over  which  sound  has  yet  been</span><span>  transmitted  by  the  telephone  in  the  Australian</span><span>  colonies.—Evening  News.</span></p> <p><span>  LATEST  FROM  PORT  DARWIN.—A  corres-  &nbsp;</span><span>  pondent,  writing  to  the  Evening  News  from</span></p> <p><span>  Port  Darwin,  says  :—We  have  had  no  less</span><span>  than  200  new  arrivals  in  one  week,  comprising  &nbsp;</span><span>  in  about  equal  proportions,  Europeans  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  Coolies.  The  Charlton  steamer,  brought</span><span>  ninety-two  Coolies  direct  from  Hongkong  ;  and</span><span>  the  General  Pel  brings  one  hundred  from  the</span><span>  south.  This  is  quite  enough  till  the  wet  &nbsp;</span><span>  season  is  over,  as  there  may  be  some  difficulty</span><span>  in  making  provision  for  them.  There  will  be  &nbsp;</span><span>  very  little  gold  to  send  by  the  mail  steamer,</span><span>  probably  not  more  than  1000  ozs.,  as  the</span><span>  batteries  have  only  started:  after  a  long  and</span><span>  severe  drought.  The  returns  from  the  reefs  &nbsp;</span><span>  are  poor,  and  no  new  discoveries  have  been  &nbsp;</span><span>  made  lately.  There  is  a  new  rush  setting  in  &nbsp;</span><span>  to  the  Driffield,  forty  miles  south  from  Pine</span><span>  Creek,  where  some  shallow  alluvial  has  been</span><span>  found,  but  there  has  not  been  sufficient  work  &nbsp;</span><span>  done  on  the  ground  to  decide  its  character.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  Marcus  Baker  and  party  are  the  prospectors,</span><span>  and  are  washing  fair  gold,  but  the  others  are  &nbsp;</span><span>  said  to  be  doing  little.  Provisions  still  keep  &nbsp;</span><span>  high,  and  cartage  to  the  Union  is  £30 a ton.</span><span>  We  have  no  fresh  beef  in  the  country,  but  a  &nbsp;</span><span>  mob  of  cattle  left  Adelaide  a  few  weeks  ago  to</span><span>  come  overland,  and  are  expected  here  in  six  &nbsp;</span><span>  months.  Mr.  Travers  has  taken  up  10,000  &nbsp;</span><span>  square  miles  of  country  for  squatting  purposes,</span><span>  but  there  is  no  word  of  stock  starting.  Con-  &nbsp;</span><span>  sidering  that  he  is  bound  to  have  two  head  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  cattle  to  every  square  mile,  we  ought  soon  to</span><span>  have  plenty  of  beef.</span></p> <p><span>  CHINESE  WOMEN  IN  SYDNEY.—As  an</span><span>  instance  of  the  prosperity  of  some  of  the</span><span>  Chinese  traders  in  this  city  (says  the  Evening</span><span>  News)  it  may  be  mentioned  that  several  have</span><span>  lately  brought  down  from  China  their  wives</span><span>  and  families.  In  Castlereagh-street  there  is  a  &nbsp;</span><span>  very  happy  family,  and  the  daughters,  two  in</span><span>  number,  and  aged  about  sixteen  and  eighteen  &nbsp;</span><span>  years,  are  a  good  sample  of  the  Chinese  beauty.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  They  are  certainly  very  modest,  and  of</span><span>  comely  appearance,  and  otherwise  indicate  &nbsp;</span><span>  good  breeding.  Their  dress  does  not  include</span><span>  the  ""  pull  back,""  to  show  the  form divine,</span><span>  but  is  loose  and  flowing.  The  hair,  which  is  &nbsp;</span><span>  very  long  and  black,  and  perhaps  a  little  wiry  &nbsp;</span><span>  (this  aside),  is  drawn  tightly  back  from  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  forehead,  tied  neatly  with  ribbon  behind,  and</span><span>  allowed  to  fall  gracefully  over  the  shoulders.  &nbsp;</span><span>  A  rose  at  the  side  completes  the  adornment.  &nbsp;</span><span>  They  appear  very  shy,  ever  among  the  white</span><span>  persons  of  their  own  sex,  in  the  neighbour-</span><span>  hood.  Their  features  are  very  regular,  and</span><span>  soft  in  outline  as  a  painting  ;  not  the  least  &nbsp;</span><span>  attractive  feature  is  their  liquid,  almond  eyes,  &nbsp;</span><span>  which  have  a  most  kindly  expression.  In  &nbsp;</span><span>  justice  to  the  Chinese,  it  ought  to  be  stated  &nbsp;</span><span>  that  those  in  Castlereagh-street,  who  are  &nbsp;</span><span>  married  to  European  women,  have  no  disrepu-  &nbsp;</span><span>  table  homes,  no  broken-hearted  wives,  no  &nbsp;</span><span>  ragged  children.  Their  homes  are  clean,  with  &nbsp;</span><span>  plants  and  flowers  to  the  very  door,  and  their  &nbsp;</span><span>  children  are  almost  the  cleanest,  the  best</span><span>  dressed,  and  best  fed  in  the  neighbourhood.</span></p> ",Article,1878-01-29,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  JULY  0,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  i  '  -*r~*</span></p> <p><span>  MR.  M'LEAN'S  ""  Permissive  ""  legislation</span><span>  has  again  proved  abortive,  notwithstand-</span><span>  ing  the  assistance  rendered  him  by  the</span><span>  new  member  for  Ipswich.  He  cannot</span><span>  complain  this  year  that  full  discussion</span><span>  was  not  given  to  his  bill,  for  the  report</span><span>  occupies  twenty-one  columns  of  ffaiisard,</span><span>  and  no  less  than  twenty-one  honorable</span><span>  members  acquainted  the  House  with</span><span>  their  opinions  upon  the  question.  It  is</span><span>  strange,  however,  that  the  speakers  all</span><span>  appear  to  have  missed  the  vital  objection</span><span>  to  the  bill,  namely,  the  principle  of  thc</span><span>  plebiscitum  which  it  seeks  to  introduce.</span><span>  That  principle  runs  counter  to  the  doc-</span><span>  trines  held  by  the  soundest  thinkers  and</span><span>  writers  on  political  economy,  and  in  our</span><span>  view  its  introduction  to  the  statute</span><span>  book  of  the  colony  is  without  justi-</span><span>  fication  or  excuse.  It  is  incompatible</span><span>  with  the  true  working  of  any  represen-</span><span>  tative  system,  and  goes  back  in  fact  lo</span><span>  the  primitive  method  known  by  political</span><span>  writers  as  ""government  in  the  market-</span><span>  place.""  The  accepted  theory  of  repre-</span><span>  sentative  institutions  is  that  the</span><span>  electoral  unit,  or  individual  elector,  has</span><span>  not  all  the  facts  before  him,  nor  has  he</span><span>  the  leisure  to  think  upon  public  ques-</span><span>  tions  with  such  care  and  deliberation  ns</span><span>  are  requisite  to  ensure  a  correct  decision.</span><span>  And  the  circumstance  that  many  indi-</span><span>  vidual  electors  are  even  more  intelligent</span></p> <p><span>  I  and  well-informed  than  the  average</span></p> <p><span>  member  of  Parliament  does  not  in-</span><span>  validate  this  theory.  Any  mass  of</span><span>  electors  must  include  a  very  large  pro-</span><span>  portion  of  persons  unqualified  to  judge</span><span>  of  the  effects  of  proposed  legislation.</span><span>  Thc  Permissive  bill  is  intended  to  make</span></p> <p><span>  men  sober  by  Act  of  Parliament,  but  the</span><span>  most  thoughtful  and  mature  politicans</span><span>  in  England,  as  well  as  in  Australia,  do</span><span>  not  believe  a  permissive  law  would  cure</span><span>  or  even  materially  alleviate  the  evils</span><span>  arising  from  the  abuse  of  alcoholic</span><span>  liquor.  In  the  face  of  such  authorities,</span><span>  and  of  the  pregnant  fact  that  the  people's</span><span>  representatives  in  Parliament  arc  per-</span><span>  plexed  to  discover  a  remedy,  does  it  not</span><span>  seem  a  rash  proposal  lo  remit  the  ques-</span><span>  tion  to  an  irresponsible  crowd  of  electors?</span><span>  If  there  is  any  centre  of  population  in</span><span>  the  colony  where  the  principle  of  alco-</span><span>  holic  prohibition  is  desired  by  the</span><span>  majority  of  inhabitants,  Parliament  may</span><span>  be  informed  of  that  fact  by  petition,  and</span><span>  then  legislation  may  take  place.  A</span><span>  special  Act  of  limited  duration  may  be</span><span>  passed,  and  thc  prohibitive  principle  thus</span><span>  be  fairly  tried.  Or,  as  in  the  case  of  the</span><span>  Municipalities  Act,  the  machinery  of</span><span>  petition  and  counter-petition  lo  the</span><span>  Governor-in-Councilmaybeapplied  to  the</span><span>  liquor  question.  Not,  however,  that  on</span><span>  thc  majority  of  petitioners  provingtobeon</span><span>  the  side  of  prohibition  it  should  at  once</span><span>  take  effect  automatically.  The  Governor</span></p> <p><span>  in-Council  should  be  endowed  willi  dis-</span><span>  cretionary  power  either  lo  acceptor  reject</span><span>  the  prayer  of  a  petition.</span></p> <p><span>  To  the  first  of  these  plans-that  of</span><span>  passing  an  experimental  Act-the  advo-</span><span>  cate  of  the  Permissive  Bill  may  object.</span><span>  But  by  objecting  he  confutes  himself,</span><span>  for  if  it  be  wrong  for  Hie  Legislature</span><span>  to  pass  an  experimental  Act  of  thc</span><span>  nature  indicated,  it  cannot  be  right  for</span><span>  Parliament  to  delegate  to  a  two</span><span>  thirds  majority  of  the  electors  of  a</span><span>  particular  town,  power  lo  apply  the</span><span>  principle  of  alcoholic  prohibition  to  such</span><span>  town.  Prohibition  is  either  right  or</span><span>  wrong.  If  right  and  expedient,  its  en-</span><span>  forcement  should  not  be  left  to  an  adven-</span><span>  titious  majority  ;  if  wrong,,  no  conceivable</span><span>  majority  could  justify  its  application  to</span><span>  any  section  of  the  country.</span></p> <p><span>  .  In  regard  to  (he  second  plan  -that  of</span><span>  petitioning  the  Governor-in-Counci!-the</span><span>  advocates  of  coercion  will  object  to  the</span><span>  discretionary  power  we  insist  upon  being</span><span>  given  to  the  Executive.  They  will  ask</span><span>  what  right  has  the  Govcrnor-in-Council</span><span>  to  override  the  wishes  of  the  majority  of</span><span>  the  people  as  expressed  in  their  petition.</span><span>  But  the  Evecutive  is  bound  to  satisfy</span><span>  itself  (i)  that  the  majority  is  real  and  not</span><span>  apparent,  for  it  is  quite  conceivable  that</span><span>  the  signaturestoboth  petitionandcounter</span><span>  petition  may  not  aggregate  a  numberequal</span><span>  to  a  moiety  of  the  persons  concerned</span><span>  who  are  qualified  to  sign;  (2)  that  the</span><span>  signatures  are  of  bona  fide  electors,  rate-</span><span>  payers,  or  householders,  as  the  case  may</span><span>  be;  and  (3)  thal  the  signatures  have  not</span><span>  been  procured  by  misrepresentation,</span><span>  fraud,  or  force.  The  automatic  applica-</span><span>  tion  of  a  prohibitory  measure  would  be</span><span>  liable  to  most  serious  abuses,  and  we  can-</span><span>  not  conceive  of  ils  being  sanctioned  by</span><span>  any  body  of  the  people's  representatives.</span><span>  Prohibition,  in  any  form,  must  interfere</span><span>  very  seriously  with  the  liberty  of  the</span><span>  subject,  which  should  always  be  guarded</span><span>  with  jealous  care,  and  only  restricted</span><span>  when  paramount  public  interests  make</span><span>  interference  imperative.  To  say  that  a</span><span>  man's  power  to  buy  or  sell  a  glass  of</span><span>  beer,  or  'that  the  business  upon  which</span><span>  his  family  subsists,  shall  be  at  any</span><span>  time  liable  to  be  tampered  with</span><span>  by  a  plebiscitum  is  preposterous.</span><span>  Vested  interests,  aiid  very  Tsrge  ones,</span><span>  there  are  in  the  liquor  trade;  and  though</span><span>  it  may  be  true  that  these  must  be  sacri-</span><span>  ficed  if  necessary  for  the  safety  of  the</span><span>  community,  it  is  monstrous  to  say  that</span><span>  they  shall  be  liable  to  summary  destruc-</span><span>  tion  by  a  capricious  majority  at  the</span><span>  ballot  box.  The  principle  of  the  Per-</span><span>  missive  Bill  is  clearly  bad,  and  we  hope</span></p> <p><span>  the  last  has  been  heard  of  it  in  this</span><span>  colony.  Wc  are  confident  that  of  the</span><span>  fifteen  members  who  voted  for  it  in  the</span><span>  late  division  not  one-half  would  assist</span><span>  to  push  the  bill  through  Committee  of</span><span>  the  Whole,  or  would  have  even  voted</span><span>  for  it  on  the  second  reading  except  on</span><span>  the  understanding  that  the  question  so</span><span>  submitted  was  of  a  purely  abstract</span></p> <p><span>  nature.</span></p> <p><span>  Belote  sanctioning  any  coercive  mea-</span><span>  sure  of  the  kind  proposed,  the  Legis-</span><span>  lature  is  bound  to  satisfy  itself  that  there</span><span>  is,  or  possibly  may  be,  some  place  in  the</span><span>  colony  where  the  liquor  traffic  ought  to</span><span>  be  abolished  by  law.  If  not  so  satisfied</span><span>  it  has  no  right  to  authorise  prohibition.</span><span>  If  prohibition  is  good  let  it  bc  generally</span><span>  applied  ;  if  bad  let  it  be  relegated  to  the</span><span>  limbo  of  abortive  projects.  Legislation</span><span>  affecting  the  liberty  of  the  subject  should</span><span>  be  authoritative  and  not  optional.</span></p> <p><span>  We  believe  that  there  is  not  thc</span><span>  remotest  prospect  of  carrying  a  Per-</span><span>  missive  Bill  within  the  present  decade,</span><span>  and  after  his  successive  defeats  Mr.</span><span>  M'Lean  can  hardly  bc  more  sanguine.</span><span>  Would  it  not  be  well,  therefore,  if  he</span><span>  suggested  to  his  Good  Templar  friends</span><span>  the  desirableness  of  a  change  of  front  ?</span><span>  If  they  cannot  wholly  abolish  public</span><span>  houses,  would  it  not  be  a  great  boon  to</span><span>  suppress  the  worst  half  of  them  ?  Thal</span><span>  there  are  quite  too  many  public-houses</span><span>  in  the  colony,  nine-tenths  of  the  people</span><span>  would  probably  be  fo\uid  lo  admit.  That</span><span>  admission  made,  it  would  not  be  difficult</span><span>  to  start  a  vigorous  movement  for  attain-</span><span>  ing  the  object.  It  is  one  that  we  believe</span><span>  ihe  Legislature  would  cheerfully  assent</span><span>  to,  and  were  the  necessity  of  weeding  out</span><span>  public-houses  forced  to  the  front  as  a</span><span>  political  question  of  pressing  importance,</span><span>  an  effective  measure  for  accomplishing</span><span>  that  object  would  soon  find  its  place  in</span><span>  the  statute  book.  In  these  columns,  we</span><span>  last  year  suggested  a  practicable  measure</span><span>  for  gradually  lessening  the  number  of</span><span>  public-houses,  and  a  measure  that  while</span><span>  effective  would  not  violate  individual</span><span>  rights,  or  capriciously  tamper  with  vested</span></p> <p><span>  interests.  If  such  a  measure  be  not</span><span>  acceptable  to  Good  Templar  reformers,</span><span>  they  must  be  content  lo  expend  their</span><span>  strength  on  vapid  orations  which  con-</span><span>  vince  nobody,  and  which  will  be  totally</span><span>  ineffective  as  a  means  of  abating  the  vice</span></p> <p><span>  of  drunkenness.</span></p> <p><span>  Tin:  Customs  colloctioiis  at  this  ¡nut  for  Hie</span><span>  i  past  week  amounted  to  £1SSS  Ss.  8(1.</span></p> <p><span>  AN  application  waa  nude  to  thc  &lt;¡old</span><span>  Wanlen  on  Saturday  liy  Messrs.

Its  re-</span><span>  presentation  at  tho  Theatre  Royal  on  Saturday</span><span>  night,  drew  a  good  house.  Miss  Clara</span><span>  Stephenson's  conception  of  Zw.  was  aristic  and</span><span>  correct.  The  character  does  not  come  so  pro-</span><span>  minently  before  thc  observer  ¡ts  this  lady's</span><span>  part  in  most  previous  dramas  performed  by</span><span>  tho  company  ;  still,  when  well  played,  as  it</span><span>  was  on  Saturday  night,  it  contributes  greatly</span><span>  to  leave  a  favourable  impression  of  the  whole</span><span>  piece.  Miss  Stephenson  excels  in  the  pa-</span><span>  thetic,  and  her  hopeless  love  was  splendidly</span><span>  portrayed.  Mr.  Scagrare,  as  Jtiroh  WCloni;i,</span></p> <p><span>  was  cast  in  a  character  in  which  he  shines.</span><span>  He  succecded'in  thoroughly  exciting  the  dis-</span><span>  like  of  the  audience  from  the  beginning-the</span><span>  beBt  test  that  could  be  given  of  his  excellence.</span><span>  Mr.  Bolton,  as  Nnlnn  Snidd'  i;  performed  hie</span><span>  part  well,  although  thc  character  does  not  give</span><span>  full  scope  for  his  peculiar  talents.

She  is  a  tight</span><span>  and  substantially  built  craft  of  202  tons</span><span>  register,  and  although  carrying  over  400  tons</span><span>  of  cargo  at  present,  is  only  drawing  twelve</span><span>  feet  of  water.  The  vessel  is  commanded  by</span><span>  Captain  Macfarlane,  whose  skill  ns  a  Beaman</span><span>  has  been  severely  tested  during  tho  present</span><span>  voyage.  Thc  cargo  consists  of  iron  pipes  for</span></p> <p><span>  our  waterworks  and  lead  and  material  for  thc</span><span>  same  ;  this  dead  weight,  and  the  vessel  being</span><span>  over-laden,  fully  account  for  the  protracted</span><span>  passage  which  she  has  made.  Captain  Mac-</span><span>  farlane  is  of  opinion  that  had  the  vessel  been</span><span>  laden  with  an  ordinary  general  cargo,  he</span><span>  would  have  made  the  trip  within  three</span><span>  months.  As  it  was,  thc  vessel  laboured</span><span>  heavily,  and  ap]»ears  to  have  been  unfortunate</span><span>  in  falling  in  with  more  than  lier  share  of  thc</span><span>  rough  and  tumble  of  thc  ¡Southern  ocean.</span><span>  Considering  thc  length  of  time  she  bas  been  at</span><span>  sea,  tile  ship  is  in  excellent  order,  and  the</span><span>  captain  feels  certain  that  had  she  not  been  au</span><span>  extreinely  strongly  built  boat,  they  would</span><span>  never  have  reached  this  port.</span></p> <p><span>  ^KMccii  inconvenience  and  annoyance  haves'</span><span>  becii  occasioned  during  the  past  few  days  by</span><span>  two  of  the  A.S.N.

The  neap  tides  arc  just  now  at</span><span>  the  lowest,  but  it  may  be  hoped  that  thc</span><span>  vessel  will  bc  lightered  so  as  to  admit  of  ber</span><span>  being  got  off  and  arriving  alongside  thc  w  harf</span><span>  !  some  time  to-day.

AU  thc  'fossickers'and  nearly  all  the</span><span>  wages  men  have  left  for  that  locality,  and</span><span>  great  difficulty  is  at  present  experienced  in</span><span>  manning  thc  différent  claims.  Wages  have</span><span>  risen  again  in  consequence  to  £410s.  per  week,</span><span>  and  even  at  that  it  may  become  necessary  to</span><span>  put  un  Chinamen  for  the  purpose  of'holding</span><span>  ground.  Numerous  applications  have  been</span><span>  made  to  mc  for  short  registrations  under  clause</span><span>  11  of  thc  regulations,  which  of  course  I  could</span><span>  not  grant.  The  taking  place  of  this  rush  at  the</span><span>  present  juncture  is  rather  to  bo  deplored  as  far  as</span><span>  th  is  gold-field  is  concerned,  asof  late  reefing  mat-</span><span>  ters  had  assumed  a  very  promising  aspect,  and</span><span>  there  was  good  reason  to  look  forward  to  the</span><span>  future  with  confidence  ;  whilst  on  tho  other</span><span>  hand,  even  taking  tile  statements  of  the  various</span><span>  prospectors  themselves  as  correct  on  all</span><span>  points,  there  is  no  reasonable  inducement  for</span><span>  diggers  to  leave  oven  a  moderate  certainty  for</span><span>  this  reported  new  goldfield.  The  crnsbings</span><span>  for  the  month  have  only  amounted  to  193  tons</span><span>  for  !>52oz.  ldwt.  of  gold,  or  an  average  of</span><span>  2oz.  lfldwt.  lSgr.  per  ton.  There  is,  however,</span><span>  a  good  quantity  of  quartz  at  grass  that  has</span><span>  not  been  reduced,  owing  partly  to  want  of</span><span>  reasonable  cartage  and  partly  to  throe  of  the</span><span>  machines  being  disabled  and  the  Pioneer  being</span></p> <p><span>  in  course  of  removal  to  thc  Louisa  line  of  reef.</span></p> <p><span>  I  have  nothing  fresh  to  report  of  importance  j</span></p> <p><span>  from  thcalluvial  workings.  A  good  many  China</span><span>  men  have  had  to  fall  back  on  thc  maui  river,</span><span>  and  from  what  I  have  been  able  to  observe</span></p> <p><span>  of  their  washing-up  their  earnings  are  but</span><span>  small.  It  would  be  difficulty  to  fix  upon  any-</span><span>  thing  like  a  correct  average  of  what  they  are</span><span>  doing,  but  that  there  is  a  decided  falling  off  in</span><span>  the  yield  of  gold  is  demonstrated  unmistakably</span><span>  by  the  fact  that  thc  gold  is  coming  in  at  a  slower</span><span>  rate  at  thc  local  banks  than  during  previous</span><span>  seasons.  The  May  escort  took  only  C335oz.  of</span><span>  gold.  Fever  in  all  its  different  degrees  of</span><span>  severity  has  been  most  prevalent  over  the  gold-</span><span>  field  during  the  month,  and  the  mortality</span><span>  amongst  the  Chinamen  bas  been  so  great  that</span><span>  they  have  evacuated  several  camps  where</span><span>  they  were  doing  fairly,  but,  were  deaths  are</span><span>  most  numerous.

The  former  is  a  very  small  court,</span><span>  but  arranged  very  prettily,  and  is  quite</span><span>  finished.  I  examined  all  closely  yesterday,  to</span><span>  tell  you.  South  Australia  has  a  quantity  of</span><span>  the  most  wonderful  apples  and  pears  I  ever</span><span>  saw,  quite  perfect  and  fresh.  They  were</span><span>  packed  in  millet  seed.  Tiie  other  fruits,</span><span>  modelled  in  wax,  were  so  beautifully  done,</span><span>  that  I  could  scarcely  be  persuaded  they  were</span><span>  not  the  real  thing.  Thc  nrches  in  those  courts</span><span>  were  artistically  draped  with  opossum  and</span><span>  otlicr  rugs,  and  what  there  was,  which  waB</span><span>  not  very  much,  was  displayed  to  the  best</span><span>  «.ÏOTtntnge.  -Oar  Trmi  ""ViCtTTTWn  COM*,  mUel)</span><span>  the  most  interesting  exhibits,  was  very  dis.</span><span>  appointing.  In  the  first  place,  the  court  is</span><span>  enclosed  in  cold  pearl-grey  arches,  supported</span><span>  by  female  statues  without  arms,  .entirely</span><span>  French,  and  having  no  connexion  or  agree-</span><span>  ment  with  anything  inside.  Our  models  of</span><span>  fruit  must  have  been  badly  packed,  as  they</span><span>  were  much  braised  mid  decidedly  wax.  Thc</span><span>  flags,  all  marked  Victoria,  showed  on  all  sides</span><span>  of  the  top-you  saw  the  name  everywhere</span><span>  had  no  purpose  in  their  arrangement.  The</span><span>  models  of  our  gold  might  have  been  placed  to</span><span>  more  advantage.  Altogether,  I  was  terribly</span><span>  disappointed,  as,  with  our  exhibits,  it  should</span><span>  have  presented  a  very  different  appearance.</span><span>  I  longed  to  pull  the  whole  thing  down  aud</span><span>  build  it  up  again  my  own  way.  Though  it</span><span>  may  seem  egotistical  to  say  BO,  I  could  have</span><span>  done  it.  There  is  not  only  an  utter  absence</span></p> <p><span>  of  taste  about  it  but  a  total  absence  of</span></p> <p><span>  design,  and  to  me  it  was  a  painful  contrast</span><span>  to  the  bright  and  pretty  little  Queensland</span><span>  court,  which  every  one  admitted,  though  there</span><span>  was  su  little  in  it,  and  yet  there  is  so  much  in</span><span>  ours.  I  am  not  speaking  my  own  opinions</span><span>  merely.  Here  no  ono  knows  we  are  Austra-</span><span>  lians,  so  I  hear  much  that  is  said.  People</span><span>  laugh  nt  Mr.  Casey,  though  bc  does  give</span><span>  great  dinners.  How  on  earth  did  he  come</span><span>  to  represent  us  bore  ?  1  think  Mr.  Ijovey  is</span><span>  liked  better,  but  they  are  both  of  a  differeut</span><span>  class  to  any  others  representing  the  re6t  of  the</span><span>  colonies,  and  no  day  that  I  have  been  at  the</span><span>  Exhibition  yet  have  I  seen  cither  Mr.  Casey</span><span>  or  Ijevcy  or  anything  being  done  towards</span><span>  completion,  though  the  court  is  in  a  very</span><span>  unfinished  state,  while  nt  thc  other  courts,</span><span>  tiie  commissioners  are  there  superintending.</span><span>  My  daughter  was  at  a  very  grand  ball  a  few</span><span>  nights  ago,  given  by  one  of  thc  Ministers.</span><span>  She  saw  Mr.  Casey  there  in  a  very  brilliant</span><span>  uniform,  which  lie  will,  I  have  no  doubt,  air</span><span>  in  Melbourne  on  bis  return.""</span></p> <p><span>  RUSSIA  IN  A  FKHMKNT.-Reaction  is</span></p> <p><span>  reported  tn  be  triumphant  in  all  thc  Russian</span><span>  Government  Departments.

It  is  ex-</span><span>  pected  that  the  pumps  will  be  at  work  in  about</span><span>  four  weeks.  Every  care  has  been  paid  to  thc</span><span>  putting  in  of  the  foundation,  so  as  to  have  the</span><span>  holding  down  gear  as  rigid  as  possible.  The</span><span>  whole  of  the  first  engine  lias  been  carefully</span><span>  overhauled,  and  all  defects  from  wear  and  tear</span><span>  made  good,  so  that  nothing  may  be  left  undone</span><span>  to  render  thc  new  machinery  perfect  in  its</span></p> <p><span>  action.""</span></p> <p><span>  THE  general  election  is  likely  (the  Courier</span><span>  says)  to  bring  out  some  candidates  whose</span><span>  value  as  public  men  will  soon  be  apparent</span><span>  when  the  new  Parliament  meets.  One  of</span><span>  these  is  Mr.  Hume  Black,  who  has  consented</span><span>  to  Borve,  if  elected,  for  the  electorate  of</span><span>  Mackay.  Mr.  Black  is  a  gentleman  of  good</span><span>  natural  capacity  and  of  mature  experience  as</span><span>  a  Queensland  settler,  and  though  new  to</span><span>  public  lifo  may  be  expected  to  make  his  mark</span><span>  in  Parliament.  ""Another  gentleman,  long</span><span>  identified  with  thc  northern  portion  of  the</span><span>  colony,  and  greatly  respected  wherever  known,</span><span>  has  consented  to  be  nominated  as  a  candidate</span><span>  for  a  .  central  constituency,  and,  we  arc</span><span>  informed,  is  certain  of  election.  This  intelli-</span><span>  gence  is  satisfactory,  as  indicating  that  the</span><span>  more  remote  constituencies  find  less  difficulty</span><span>  than  formerly  in  securing  the  services  of  com-</span><span>  petent  representative  men.""  Who  this  last</span><span>  named  gentleman  is,  and  for  what  central  con-</span><span>  stituency  he  has  consented  to  be  nominated,</span><span>  are  questions  which  our  contemporary  does</span></p> <p><span>  not  venture  to  answer.  His  reticence  is  rather</span><span>  tantalising.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  late  visit  of  the  Town  Surveyor  to</span><span>  Brisbane  has  not  been  altogether  a  pleasure</span><span>  trip,  as  is  seen  by  that  gentleman's  report</span><span>  laid  before  the  Council  at  last  meeting.  The</span><span>  following  is  his  description  of  the  stone-</span><span>  breaking  machine  for  some  time  used  in  Bris-</span><span>  bane  :--""I  devoted  portions  of  several  days</span><span>  to  the  working  of  the  stone-breaking  machine</span><span>  now  used  with  a  large  saving  by  the  Brisbane</span><span>  Corporation.  It  is  without  exception  the</span><span>  most  economical  means  of  procuring  road</span><span>  metal,  of  any  guage,  one  can  possibly  conceive</span><span>  of,  producing  at  one  time  stone  from  6,  5,  4,</span><span>  3,  2,  and  1  inch  gauge  for  blinding  purposes</span><span>  and  asphalt,  and  an  impalpable  dust,</span><span>  which  furnishes  that  very  fine  and  smooth</span><span>  finish  so  remarkable  in  the  pathways.</span><span>  The  machine  cracked  sixty  loads  of</span><span>  stone  on  one  of  the  days  I  attended  at  it.  It  is</span><span>  worked  by  an  engine  and  two  men  :  one  man</span><span>  for  breaking  the  stones  to  the  size  of  the</span><span>  mouth  14  inches  by  7  (ours  will  be  10  x  9),  and</span><span>  the  other  feeding;  the  broken  metal  falls</span><span>  upon  an  incline,  rendering  the  loading  nearly</span><span>  self-acting.""  With  regard  to  the  steam  roller</span><span>  lately  obtained  by  the  Brisbane  Corporation,</span><span>  Mr.  Clements  writes:--""After  the  stone-</span><span>  breaking  machine  comes  the  steam  roller.</span><span>  The  wonderful  improvement  effected  by  this</span><span>  road-making  machine,  I  was  fortunate  in</span><span>  witnessing  upon  a  large  area  of  street  some</span><span>  chains  long  near  the  A.S.N.  Co.'s  wharf.  A</span><span>  quantity  of  new  metal  was  laid  down  on</span><span>  Friday  morning,  the  metal  was  about</span><span>  nine  inches  thick,  spread  upon  a  coarse</span><span>  blinding  of  the  depth  of  about  three</span><span>  inches.  The  roller  went  to  work  on  the</span><span>  surface  on  Monday  morning,  and  at  sundown</span><span>  the  surface  was  as  hard  and  smooth  as  though</span><span>  made  and  consolidated  for  years.  I  failed  to</span><span>  detect  the  tracks  of  the  wheels  of  a  four-ton</span><span>  waggon  on  Tuesday  morning.  I  am  of  opinion</span><span>  that  that  piece  of  roadway  will  not  cost  the</span><span>  Brisbane  Corporation  one  shilling  for  main-</span><span>  tenance  for  some  time  to  come.  The  complete</span></p> <p><span>  success  of  the  steam  roller  I  frequently  wit-</span><span>  nessed  in  other  parts  of  the  city,  but  notably</span><span>  at  the  locality  described  above.""</span></p> <p><span>  STATE  of  thc  Hospital  for  thc  week  ending</span><span>  Friday,  20th  September:-Admitted  during  thc</span><span>  week  :  Males,  6  ;  Females,  1.

C.  Zurich's  forfeited</span><span>  selection  (508  acres)  district  of  Gladstone,</span><span>  will  be  open  to  conditional  selection  at  the</span><span>  upset  price  of  10s.  per  acre,  on  and  after  the</span><span>  8th  October  next.  It  is  notified  for  public</span><span>  information  that  Messrs.  Milman  and  Jardine</span><span>  have  applied  to  tho  Government  for  the</span><span>  closing  of  the  road  separating  portions  ll,  12,</span><span>  13,  and  14  from  portion  16,  in  the  parish  of</span><span>  Cawarral.  A  plan  of  the  rood  is  to  be  seen  at</span><span>  the  Lands  Offioe,  Rockhampton.  A  pro-</span><span>  clamation  by  the  Government  of  Victoria  is</span><span>  published,  fixing  thc  scale  of  diet  and</span><span>  medicines  for  vessels  carrying  passengers  from</span><span>  Victoria  to  New  Guinea.</span></p> <p><span>  YESTERDAY  afternoon  another  accident</span><span>  occurred  by  which  a  man  named  William</span><span>  Cotton,  employed  in  connection  with  the</span><span>  Training  Wall  works,  lost  his  life.  It  appears</span><span>  that  the  steam  tug  Mary  with  two  punts  was</span><span>  at  the  Government  slip,  Cotton  being  on  one</span><span>  of  the  punts  engaged  in  heaving  up  the  anchor</span><span>  by  means  of  a  winch.  The  tide  was  making</span><span>  at  thc  time,  and  as  the  Mary  was  coming  to</span><span>  thc  punts,  Calton  called  out  for  her  to  go</span><span>  ahead.  The  attention  of  West,  the  master  of</span><span>  the  steamer  was  immediately  afterwards</span><span>  attracted  by  a  noise,  and  ou  looking  round  he</span><span>  observed  the  handle  of  the  winch  revolving  at</span><span>  a  rapid  rate  and  Cotton  lying  underneath  it.</span><span>  On  the  men  on  the  steamer  boarding  the  punt</span><span>  they  found  Cotton  had  sustained  serious</span><span>  injuries,  the  flesh  being  completely  torn  from</span><span>  his  left  arm  below  tho  elbow.  He  was</span><span>  removed  to  the  steamer  Mary,  and  further</span></p> <p><span>  examination  disclosed  that  be  had  also</span><span>  received  a  cut  on  the  head,  from  which  the</span><span>  brain  was  protruding.  Thc  steamer  proceeded</span><span>  to  town,  and  shortly  after  leaving  Cotton</span><span>  expired,  not  having  recovered  consciousness.</span><span>  Ou  arrival  at  the  Government  Wharf  tho</span><span>  Police  Magistrate  was  sent  for,  and  having</span><span>  viewed  the  body,  the  usual  burial  order  was</span><span>  given.  We  understand  the  deceased  was  a</span><span>  single  man,  about  thirty  years  of  agc,  and  bore</span><span>  the  reputation  of  having  been  a  sober,  steady</span><span>  man  during  the  twelve  months  be  had  been</span><span>  engaged  at  the  works.  A  magisterial  inquiry</span><span>  into  tbe  affair  will  be  held  at  the  earliest  op-</span><span>  portunity.  No  person  witnessed  the  accident,</span><span>  and  it  is  merely  surmised  that  Cotton  must</span><span>  have  lost  his  hold  of  the  winch  handle  as  the</span><span>  punt  was  being  drawn  by  the  steam-tug,  and</span><span>  being  struck  by  it  sustained  thc  injuries  de-</span></p> <p><span>  scribed.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  monthly  meeting  of  the  Committee  of</span><span>  the  Fitzroy  Pastoral,  Agricultural,  and  Hor-</span><span>  ticultural  Society  was  held  yesterday  after-</span><span>  noon,  at  four  o'clock,  in  the  office  of  the</span><span>  secretary  (Mr.  H.

Macfarlane</span><span>  and  Headrick  through  Mr.  Clements  was</span><span>  suspended  ?  The  Secretary  (Mr.  Risien)  was</span><span>  instructed  to  reply  that  it  was.  A  letter  was</span><span>  read  from  the  Secretary  of  the  Fire  Brigade,</span><span>  asking  for  the  use  of  the  Society's  ground  on</span><span>  which  to  hold  their  annual  picnic.

The  eighth</span><span>  section  enacts  that  ""the  interest  upon</span><span>  any  sums  borrowed  under  the  authority</span><span>  of  this  Act  »Illili  bo  deemed  to  be  a</span><span>  charge  upon  all  the  revenues  of  the  colony,""</span><span>  and  ""shall  also  have  priorty  to  all  demands</span><span>  thereon.""

Kain  and  hail  fell  heavily  for</span><span>  three  oi  four  minutes-not  more,  and  the</span><span>  hcavinesi  of  it  may  bc  gathered  from  the  rain</span><span>  gauge,  vhich  showed  0'lC  in  that  brief</span><span>  interval.  During  the  day  thunder  showers</span><span>  fell  in  vinous  parts  of  thu'  district  ;  but</span><span>  between  s;ven  and  eight  o'clock  in  tho  even-</span><span>  ing  a  sto-m  of  great  violence  passed  over</span><span>  Gowrie,  Oakey  Creek,  and  Meringandan.</span><span>  Thc  hailstoaes  were  of  large  size-au  inch  and</span><span>  a  iiuartcr  in  diameter  in  some  instances-and</span><span>  the  morning  train  from  Dalby  brought  to</span><span>  Toowoomba,  from  Oakey  Creek,  a  block  of  icc</span><span>  121b.  weight,  formed  of  hailstones  which  bad</span><span>  drifted  against  one  of  the  corners  of  a  culvert.</span><span>  Our  informant  states  that  the  block  of  icc</span><span>  brought  by  the  train  was  only  the  portion  of  a</span><span>  long  drift  of  hailstones  six  inches  or  seven</span><span>  inches  deep.  After  thc  storm,  the  hailstones</span><span>  lay  on  thc  ground  in  pieces  two  inches  in</span><span>  depth,  and  did  not  disappear  until  long  after</span><span>  thc  sun  had  risen  on  Monday  morning.  It  is</span><span>  fortunate  the  growing  crops,  in  the  localities</span><span>  named,  are  not  in  a  very  forward  state,  or  the</span><span>  damage  would  have  been  very  great.  As  it</span><span>  is,  we  are  afraid  we  shall  hear  of  losses  of</span><span>  young  lambs,  and  of  the  more  advanced  of  the</span><span>  wheat  and  barley  crops.  Hailstorms  of  this</span><span>  violent  character,  at  this  time  of  thc  year,  and</span><span>  coming  from  the  north-west,  are  very  unusual</span><span>  occurrences,  aid  indicate  a  very  disturbed</span><span>  state  of  thc  atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  HAILSTOHM  AT  MOUNT  ESK.-On</span><span>  Sunday  afternoon  the  15th  instant  (writes  the</span><span>  special  reporter  of  thc  Obtener),  Mount  Esk</span><span>  was  visited  with  one  of  the  most  severe  hail-</span></p> <p><span>  storms  that  it  is  possible  to  conceive.  So</span><span>  many  people  Lave  doubted  the  actual  facts</span><span>  that  before  detailing  particulars  I  may  state</span></p> <p><span>  that  I  witnessed  the  storm  at  the  residence  of</span><span>  Mr.  Robert  Henderson,  and  that  gentleman,</span><span>  as  well  as  Messrs.  E.  H.  Blunt,  Vt.  Harris,</span><span>  and  T.  Foreman  were  also  there.  About  3</span><span>  o'clock  we  noticed  the  clouds  gathering,  and</span><span>  Eleasantly  anticipated  a  heavy  shower  of  rain,</span></p> <p><span>  ut  heavy  thunder  soon  began  rolling  in  thc</span><span>  distance,  followed  hy  vivid  lightning.  After</span><span>  a  few  minutes  it  began  to  drop  with  rain,  and</span><span>  a  storm  began  to  rise  behind  Mount  Esk.  It</span><span>  was  evident  if  the  two  storms  met  that  we</span><span>  should  have  a  ""buster,""  and  we  did.  The</span><span>  opposing  storms  mot  right  over  our  heads,  and</span><span>  we  therefore  felt  the  full  force  of  the  storm.</span><span>  Presently  it  began  to  hail,  and  gradually  the</span><span>  hailstones  grew  larger  and  larger  ;  it  hailed</span><span>  from  about  ten  minutes  past  3  until  twenty</span><span>  minutes  to  4,  the  ground  around  being</span><span>  perfectly  white  and  every  blade  of  grass</span><span>  hidden.  To  give  some  idea  of  the  depth,  we</span><span>  measured  the  buggy  wheel  and  found  that</span><span>  Sin.  of  hailstones  uad  clustered  around  there.</span></p> <p><span>  Duiring  the  fall  of  hailstones  we  repeatedly</span><span>  rushed  out  to  secure  any  that  appeared  to  be</span><span>  of  extreme  size,  and  luckily  having  a  measure</span></p> <p><span>  between  2in.  and  4in.  in  diameter,  while</span><span>  hundreds  wc  quite  5in.  in  circumference.  As</span><span>  may  be  well  supposed,  thc  noise  on  the  roof</span><span>  was  tremendous,  and  as  the  hail  fell,  the</span><span>  cattle  and  horses  rushed  madly  hither  and</span><span>  thither,  evidently  suffering  great  pain  from</span><span>  thc  blows.  The  hail  having  laBtcd  half-au</span><span>  hour,  the  sky  slightly  cleared,  and  we  ex-</span><span>  perienced  thc  most  intense  cold,  all  of  us</span><span>  seeking  our  overcoats  ;  and  on  gaining  these</span><span>  and  once  more  returning  to  tho  verandah,  we</span><span>  found  a  dense  mist  had  arisen,  so  that  ono</span><span>  could  scarcely  see  ten  yards  ahead.  This  mist</span><span>  disappeared  and  rose  at  intervals  during  the</span><span>  afternoon,  being  swept  backwards  aud  for-</span><span>  wards  by  the  changeable  wind.  About  ten</span><span>  minutes  after  the  hail  a  pouring  rain  fell,  and</span><span>  this,  helping  to  melt  the  hailstones,  caused</span><span>  the  paddocks  to  bc  flooded  and  all  thc</span><span>  neighbouring  gullies  rushed  with  water.</span><span>  About  5  o'clock  in  thc  morning,  while  running</span><span>  the  horses  into  thc  stockyard,  wc  found  sonic</span><span>  hailstones  still  remaining,  which  measured</span><span>  4in.  in  diameter.  Without  a  particle  of</span><span>  exaggeration,  such  are  the  peculiar  circum-</span><span>  stances  of  thc  storm.  All  the  windows  in  the</span><span>  town  faciug  the  storm  were  broken,  and  the</span><span>  damage  to  thc  cattle  and  property  must  have</span><span>  been  great  ;  but  perhaps  this  is  amply  made</span><span>  up  by  the  great  bountiful  supply  of  water.</span><span>  The  storm  only  evtended  over  an  area  of  a  few</span></p> <p><span>  miles.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  QCEBN-STEEET  OUTRAGE.  -  The</span><span>  Courier  of  the  10th  instant  says  :-Au  outrage,</span><span>  resulting  in  the  death  of  Daniel  Driscoll,  a</span><span>  carpenter,  aged  about  35  or  40  years,  residing</span><span>  at  the  Ipswich  boarding-house,  Gcorge-ßtrect,</span><span>  was  committed  in  our  main  thoroughfare</span><span>  about  midnight  on  Saturday  lost.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  OCTOBER  18,  1876.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  correspondence  which  has  taken</span><span>  place  between  the  South  Australian  and</span><span>  Queensland  Governments,  respecting  the</span><span>  future  junction  of  the  railway  systems  of</span><span>  these  two  colonies,  is  highly  interesting,</span><span>  and  is  likely  to  do  good  by  eliciting  dis-</span><span>  cussion  on  the  most  advisable  direction</span><span>  for  railway  extension  into  the  Interior  of</span><span>  the  Australian  Continent</span></p> <p><span>  The  correspondence  contains  reports</span><span>  on  this  subject  by  Mr.  H.  C.  Stanley,</span><span>  Chief  Engineer  of  Railways  in  this</span><span>  colony  ;  and  Mr.  G.  C.  Watson,  Com-</span><span>  missioner  of  Crown  Lands  of  (he  districts</span><span>  of  Warrego  and  Gregory  South.  Each</span><span>  of  these  gentlemen  proposes  a  scheme</span><span>  having  in  view  the  construction  of  a</span><span>  Transcontinential  Railway,  in  which</span><span>  Queensland  would  possess  a  large</span><span>  interest  But  that  sketched  out  by  Mr.</span><span>  Stanley  takes  a  far  wider  scope,  and</span><span>  contemplates  a  network  of  railways</span><span>  embracing  not  only  Queensland  and</span><span>  South  Australia,  but  also  New  South</span><span>  Wales  and  Victoria.  He  takes  account</span><span>  of  the  railways  already  constructed</span><span>  or  authorised,  and  indicates  how</span><span>  these  may  be  made  to  form</span><span>  part  of  an  Intercolonial  system.  The</span><span>  scheme,  however,  has  been  drawn  out  in</span><span>  the  absence  of  definite  knowledge  as  to</span><span>  the  configuration  of  the  country  and  the</span><span>  probable  direction  of  traffic  as  settle-</span><span>  ment  progresses  in  the  interior  of  the</span><span>  Continent.  But  Mr.  Stanley  hopes  that</span></p> <p><span>  it  may  serve  to  indicate  the  ground-</span><span>  work  of  what  may  eventually  prove  a</span><span>  convenient  and  practical  system  of  inter-</span><span>  colonial  railways.  With  this  end  in</span><span>  view,  he  suggests  thc  advisability  of</span><span>  initiating  some  plan  of  exploration</span><span>  surveys,  with  the  object  of  furnishing  the</span><span>  Government  with  definite  and  reliable</span><span>  information  respecting  the  physical</span><span>  characteristics  of  t!ie  country  which</span><span>  these  probable  lines  would  traverse,  as  a</span><span>  guide  in  determining  the  particular  route</span><span>  to  be  followed  by  any  projected  line.</span><span>  Such  surveys,  he  says,  might  be  effected</span><span>  to  a  great  extent  by  means  of  baro-</span><span>  metrical  observations,  and  the  fixing  of</span><span>  certain  points  by  latitude  and  longitude  ;</span><span>  and  whilst  the  cost  would  be  trifling  as</span><span>  compared  with  that  of  ordinary  trial</span><span>  surveys,  the  information  obtained  would,</span><span>  he  believes,  prove  of  great  value  in</span><span>  determining  a  general  system  of  rail-</span></p> <p><span>  ways.</span></p> <p><span>  The  main  feature  in  Mr.  Stanley's</span><span>  scheme  is  an  ""  Intercolonial  Central</span></p> <p><span>  Railway,""  connecting  »villi  the  Victorian</span><span>  system  and  running  north  in  a  straight</span><span>  line  through  New  South  Wales  and</span><span>  Queensland  to  Landsdowne,  thence</span><span>  travelling  north-westerly  via  Blackall  and</span><span>  Cloncurry  to  the  Gulf  at  the  mouth  of</span><span>  the  Leichhardt  River.  This  main  trunk</span><span>  line  would  be  intersected  at  Bourke,  by</span><span>  a  line  from  Adelaide,  following  nearly  in</span><span>  ih&lt;*  course  of  thc  Ruo  Darling;  and</span><span>  by  two  New  South  Wales  lines-one</span><span>  being  a  continuation  of  that  already</span><span>  made  from  Sydney  to  Bathurst,  and  that</span><span>  branching  off  from  the  Northern  line  in</span><span>  that  colony  at  a  [joint  some  few  miles  from</span><span>  Newcastle.  In  Queensland,  it  would  be</span><span>  intersected  by  three  trunk  lines-the</span><span>  Southern  and  Western  being  extended</span><span>  due  westerly  from  Roma,  and  the  Central</span><span>  due  westerly  from  the  Comet;  whilst  the</span><span>  northern  line  from  Townsville,  would</span><span>  be  extended  a  little  south  of  west,</span><span>  intersecting  it  at  the  Cloncurry.  An</span><span>  extension  is  also  indicated  from  Yuleba,</span><span>  on  thc  Southern  and  Western  line,</span><span>  south-westerly  lo  Bourke,  where  would</span><span>  be  established  a  central  interchang-</span><span>  ing  station-the  Victorian  gauge  of  s  ft</span><span>  3  in.  being  continued  from  Denili-</span><span>  quin  ;  and  the  3  ft.  6  in.  gauge  being</span><span>  also  continued  from  Queensland  to  that</span><span>  point,  upon  which  the  different  gauges  of</span><span>  all  the  colonies  would  converge,  and  where</span><span>  -j-»--""&lt;»""  bining  Horn  lileaK  01  gauge</span></p> <p><span>  might  be  minimised  by  the  adoption  of</span><span>  suitable  mechanical  appliances  for  trans-</span><span>  ferring  goods,  &c,  from  one  line  to  the</span><span>  other.  Mr.  Stanley  also  marks  on  the</span><span>  map  explanatory  of  his  proposals,  an</span><span>  extension  of  the  line  from  Roma  west-</span><span>  ward  to  the  South  Australian  boundary.</span></p> <p><span>  One  condition  to  the  adoption  of  this</span><span>  scheme  is  the  existence  of  a  harbour</span><span>  adequate  to  the  purposes  of  a  trans-</span><span>  continental  railway,  on  the  shores  of</span><span>  the  Gulf.  Mr.  Stanley  assumes  that</span><span>  a  suitable  port  does  exist  at  or  near  the</span><span>  mouth  of  the  Leichhardt  River,  and  Mr.</span><span>  Douglas,  in  his  memo,  on  the  subject</span><span>  addressed  to  the  Chief  Secretary  of</span><span>  South  Australia,  says  he  believes  that</span><span>  such  port  will  be  found  in  that  locality.</span><span>  He  does  nut  say,  however,  upon  what</span><span>  data  his  belief  is  based.  Mr.  Watson</span><span>  names  the  mouth  of  the  Albert  River  as</span></p> <p><span>  the  locality  of  the  terminal  port,  but  he</span><span>  is  evidently  doubtful  regarding  this  part</span><span>  of  his  proposals,  as  he  suggests  the  pos-</span><span>  sible  advisability  of  taking  the  line  on  to</span><span>  Port  Darwin.  Some  few  years  ago,</span><span>  when  a  project  was  brought  under  the</span><span>  consideration  of  the  Queensland  Govern-</span><span>  ment  for  a  Transcontinental  Railway,</span><span>  Lieutenant  Connor,  R.N.,  examined  the</span><span>  shores  of  the  Gulf  and  came  to  the  con-</span><span>  clusion  that  no  harbour  worthy  the  name</span><span>  existed  there,  and  reported  accordingly.</span><span>  It  would  be  interesting  to  know  whether</span><span>  the  Government  is  in  possession  of</span><span>  further  information  on  this  subject.  The</span><span>  Queenslander  surveying  expedition  is</span><span>  attempting  lo  find  a  practicable</span><span>  route  lor  a  line  of  railway  from</span><span>  Blackall  to  Port  Darwin,  acting,</span><span>  we  believe,  on  the  assumption  that</span><span>  a  good  port  cannot  be  found  on  the</span><span>  northern  shores  of  this  colony.  We  are</span><span>  reluctant  to  adopt  this  conclusion  hastily,</span><span>  and  incline  to  the  opinion  that  steps</span><span>  should  be  taken  to  settle  this  point  one</span><span>  way  or  the  other  beyond  doubt  as</span><span>  quickly  as  practicable.  Mr.  Douglas</span><span>  says  our  Government  contemplates  a</span><span>  thorough  examination  of  the  western</span><span>  country,  in  accordance  with  Mr.</span><span>  Stanley's  recommendations,  with  a</span><span>  view  to  future  railway  extension,</span><span>  but  he  says  nothing  about  the</span><span>  advisability  of  taking  measures  to</span><span>  clear  up  the  doubt  as  to  the  existence  of</span><span>  shipping  facilities  on  the  shores  of  Car-</span><span>  pentaria.</span></p> <p><span>  The  approximate  distances  by  Mr.</span><span>  Stanley's  Intercolonial  Central  Railway,</span><span>  between  a  northern  terminus  at  the  Gulf,</span><span>  the  principal  ports  of  this  colony,  and</span><span>  the  capitals  of  the  Southern  colonies,  are</span></p> <p><span>  estimated  as  under  :</span></p> <p><span>  Rockhampton.  875  miles</span><span>  Brisbane  .  1,275  ""</span></p> <p><span>  Sydney.  1,440  ""</span><span>  Melbourne  .  1,050  ""</span><span>  Adelaide  .  1,000  ""</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Stanley  also  sketches  out  a  plan</span><span>  for  connecting  the  various  ports  of</span><span>  Queensland  by  rail  with  the  capital  of</span><span>  the  colony,  but  this  has  nothing  to  do</span><span>  with  the  question  of  the  junction  of  the</span><span>  railway  systems  of  Queensland  and</span><span>  South  Australia,  and  may  be  left  over</span><span>  for  separate  consideration.  Mr.  Watson's</span><span>  report,  however,  deals  with  the  main</span></p> <p><span>  question,  and  we  shall  take  an  early  op-  ]</span><span>  portunity  of  commenting  upon  his  pro-  I</span></p> <p><span>  posais  and  the  information  he  supplies  ;</span><span>  relative  to  the  character  of  the  country  I</span><span>  in  the  south-western  portion  of  this  j</span></p> <p><span>  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  Fitzroy  Lodge  of  Good  Templars  meets</span><span>  in  the  Oddfellows'  Hall,  this  evening  at  a</span><span>  quarter  to  eight  o'clock.</span></p> <p><span>  Is  reference  to  thc  accident  to  a  seaman  of</span><span>  the  Jeanie  Loutitt,  wc  stated  yesterday,  that</span><span>  wc  were  unable  to  give  particulars  in  thc</span><span>  matter  other  than  had  been  gathered  in  a</span><span>  casual  way,  as  the  ductor  and  captain  did  not</span><span>  appear  anxious  to  give  information.

"<p><span>  The Morning Bulletin,¶ ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  JANUARY  8,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  JUDGING  by  our  metropolitan  contem-</span><span>  poraries,  the  doings  of  politicians  in  New</span><span>  South  Wales  and  Victoria  are  of  much</span><span>  more  interest  to  the  people  of  Queens-</span><span>  land  than  are  the  proceedings  of  our</span><span>  own  public  men.  The  admirable  policy</span><span>  of  abstention  from  comment  on  local</span><span>  matters  which  is  now  fashionable  at</span><span>  Brisbane  saves  the  conductors  of  the</span><span>  Press  much  anxiety  and  responsibility,</span><span>  Every  Queensland  journalist  has  his</span><span>  unlicensed  fling  at  Mr.  Berry,  and</span><span>  our  Conservatives  and  Liberals  try  to</span><span>  surpass  each  other  in  denunciation  of</span><span>  that  erring  statesman's  practices.  The</span><span>  New  South  Wales  knights  also  have</span><span>  been  given  some  hard  knocks  of  late  ;</span><span>  while  the  wickedness  of  the  aggressive</span><span>  Czar  has  formed  the  staple  of  the</span><span>  Queenslander's  mental  food.  All  these</span><span>  are  safe  subjects,  and  may  be  dashed  off</span><span>  by  slashing  leader  writers  by  the  column</span><span>  without  the  slightest  fear  of  wounding</span><span>  anybody's  susceptibilities  or  eliciting  a</span><span>  single  disagreeable  remonstrance.  But</span><span>  while  the  whole  colony  of  Queensland</span><span>  talks  of  the  eccentricities  of  its  platonic</span><span>  Premier,  and  while  it  is  currently</span><span>  reported  that  at  least  one  member</span><span>  of  the  Ministry  is  about  to  retire,</span><span>  the  newspaper  Press  is  virtually  dumb.</span><span>  Yet  our  Parliament  should  meet  within</span><span>  three  months  of  the  present  date,  and</span><span>  must  dispose  of  perhaps  the  most</span><span>  difficult  question  that  it  has  ever  been</span><span>  called  upon  to  solve.  We  refer  to  the</span><span>  Redistribution  of  Electorates;  and  there</span><span>  are  also  other  important  questions  which</span><span>  Governors'  Speeches  have  for  years  past</span><span>  informed  the  country  were  much  in  need</span><span>  of  settlement.</span></p> <p><span>  It  may  be  granted  that  the  uncer-</span><span>  tainty  which  exists  as  to  the  personnel</span><span>  and  politics  of  the  Ministry  who  will</span><span>  next  meet  Parliament,  is  rather  per-</span><span>  plexing  to  the  public  writer.  Mr.  Douglas</span><span>  evidently  intends  to  retain  the  Premier-</span><span>  ship,  and  the  country  pretty  fairly</span><span>  understands  what  his  policy  was  six</span><span>  months  ago.  That  was  to  encourage  the</span><span>  formation  of  monster  estates  ;  to  start</span><span>  ill-considered  railway  schemes  ;  to  pro-</span><span>  vide  one  class  of  employers  with  black</span><span>  labour  and  deny  it  to  all  other  classes  ;</span><span>  to  consolidate  his  parliamentary  majority</span><span>  by  bribing  members  or  coercing  them  by</span><span>  bribing  their  constituencies;  and  to</span><span>  redistribute  the  electorates  on  the  popu-</span><span>  lation  basis.  Whether  or  not  the</span><span>  Premier  will  repeat  this  policy  next</span><span>  session  it  is  difficult  to  say.  Something</span><span>  will  depend  upon  his  then  colleagues,  and</span><span>  more  upon  the  necessities  of  the  moment.</span><span>  To  expect  that  any  of  the  ""  stock  ""</span><span>  measures,  such  as  financial  separation</span><span>  and  local  government,  will  be  dealt  with,</span><span>  would  be  to  indulge  in  credulity  of  the</span><span>  most  childish  character.  Redistribution</span><span>  will  be  the  all-absorbing  topic,  for  upon</span><span>  its  satisfactory  settlement  the  integrity  of</span><span>  the  colony  as  such  mainly  depends.  We</span><span>  may  as  well  warn  the  Government  at</span><span>  once  that  if  the  majority  in  the  present</span><span>  Parliament  insist  upon  representation</span><span>  strictly  on  the  population  basis,  terri-</span><span>  torial  Separation  will  be  inevitable.</span></p> <p><span>  As  to  the  subordinate  members  of  the</span><span>  Ministry,  report  says  that  His  Honor</span><span>  Chief  Justice  Cockle  goes  home  in</span><span>  February,  and  that  the  Attorney-General</span><span>  will  be  elevated  to  the  Bench.  Perhaps</span><span>  under  the  circumstances  this  would  be  a</span><span>  convenient  arrangement,  for  otherwise</span><span>  odd  questions  might  be  put  by  honorable</span><span>  members  in  regard  to  the  Davenport</span><span>  case.  It  is  also  confidently  stated  that</span><span>  Mr.  Thorn  goes  home  before  Parliament</span><span>  assembles.  The  question  then  arises  as</span><span>  to  who  will  be  the  depositaries  of  the</span><span>  vacant  portfolios,  and  what  will  be  the</span><span>  influence  of  the  new  members  upon  the</span><span>  policy  of  the  Government  ?</span></p> <p><span>  The  inevitable  Attorney-General,  in</span><span>  the  event  of  Mr.  Griffith's  translation  is</span><span>  Mr.  Garrick,  and  rumour  points  to  two</span><span>  names  as  those  from  which  the  new</span><span>  Minister  for  Lands  will  be  chosen.  One</span><span>  of  these  is  Mr.  Groom,  the  member  for</span><span>  Toowoomba;  the  other  Mr.  John  Macros-</span><span>  san,  the  indefatigable  ""  Northern  Cham-</span><span>  pion.""  Mr.  Groom,  however,  is  believed to</span><span>  be  ""out  of  the  running,""  for  independent  of</span><span>  other  potent  considerations  his  assump-</span><span>  of  the  Lands  Department  would  mean</span><span>  an  entire  reversal  of  the  Land  policy  of</span><span>  the  present  Government.  Mr.  Groom</span><span>  has  been  consistent  in  one  point  through-</span><span>  out  his  long  parliamentary  career,—his</span><span>  repugnance  to  the  auction  system  ;  the</span><span>  present  Government  have  revived  it  on</span><span>  a  scale  of  unparalleled  magnitude.  So</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Groom's  name  may  be  dismissed  for</span><span>  the  present.</span></p> <p><span>  The  next  question  is—Could  Ministers,</span><span>  in  common  decency,  invite  Mr.  Mac-</span><span>  rossan  to  join  them  ?  And  could  he,  under</span><span>  any  possible  conditions,  consent  to  join</span><span>  them  ?  Our  opinion  is  most  distinctly  in</span><span>  the  negative;  yet  persons  better  in-</span></p> <p><span>  formed  than  we  are  affirm  that  Mr.  Mac-</span><span>  rossan  is  the  coming  Minister  for  Lands.</span><span>  We  cannot  believe  this,  however;  for</span><span>  Mr.  Macrossan  could  join  no  Ministry</span><span>  who  would  not  make  financial  separation</span><span>  a  government  measure  of  the  most</span><span>  urgent  importance.  But  this  Mr.</span><span>  Douglas  could  not  well  agree  to  do  ;  and</span><span>  Mr.  Garrick,  as  an  obstructor  of</span><span>  the  bill  last  session,  would  make</span><span>  shipwreck  of  his  yet  untarnished</span><span>  reputation  by  supporting  it  for  office</span></p> <p><span>  sake.  It  is  true  that  this  hon.  member's</span><span>  feat  last  session,  of  making  one  of  the</span><span>  most  damaging  speeches  upon  the  Rail-</span><span>  way  Reserves  Bill,  and  then  voting  for</span><span>  it,  conveys  the  impression  that  under  a</span><span>  perfectly  honest  exterior  there  lurks  the</span><span>  manysidedness  of  the  accomplished</span><span>  lawyer.  However,  the  chances  are,  we</span><span>  think,  that  Mr.  Macrossan's  decided</span><span>  opinions  on  financial  separation,  to  say</span><span>  nothing  of  other  obstacles,  exclude  him</span><span>  from  any  possible  combination  in  the</span><span>  Douglas  Ministry.</span></p> <p><span>  There  will  remain  Mr.  Pettigrew,</span><span>  Mr.  Beattie,  and  Mr.  Tyrel,  to  fall  back</span><span>  upon,  and  perhaps  even  others.  It  is</span><span>  just  on  the  cards  that  the  member  for</span><span>  Cook  may  be  offered  the  portfolio  of</span><span>  Justice  and  Education  which,  Mr.</span><span>  Griffith  states,  need  not  be  in  the  hands</span></p> <p><span>  of  a  barrister  ;  and  perhaps  Mr.  J</span><span>  Murphy's  friend,  the  hon.  member  for</span><span>  Blackall,  might  be  induced  to  take</span><span>  charge  of  the  Lands.  But,  really,  this</span><span>  brings  us  to  the  verge  of  chaos,  and</span><span>  pending  some  fresh  development,  we</span><span>  refrain  from  further  speculation.

W.</span><span>  Jackson  and  Co.—closed  their  share-list  last</span></p> <p><span>  night,  having  received  applications  for  3140  &nbsp;</span><span>  shares.  When  the  mine  was  purchased,  some</span><span>  three  thousand  shares  were  guaranteed  from</span><span>  this  district,  but  they  had  not  all  been  taken</span><span>  up  then.  Should  Rockhampton  and  Peak</span><span>  Downs  together  take  6000  shares—as  is  most</span></p> <p><span>  probable—there  will  be  a  balance  of  4000  &nbsp;</span><span>  shares  available  for  Sydney,  and  that  number  &nbsp;</span><span>  will  be  taken  up  in  a  day.  We  should  have</span><span>  liked  to  see  three-fourths  of  the  shares  remain</span><span>  in  the  district;  still  the  matter  has  been</span><span>  managed  very  well,  and  we  have  only  to  ex-</span></p> <p><span>  press  a  hope  that  those  who  have  purchased  &nbsp;</span><span>  shares  will  keep  them,  that  is,  if  they  desire  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  to  retain  the  management.</span></p> <p><span>  The  town  of  Clermont  seems  to  have  been</span><span>  placed  under  strict  police  surveillance on the last</span><span>  night  of  the  Old  Year.  According  to  the  local</span><span>  press,  the  police  were  requested  to  prevent  the</span><span>  beating  of  kerosene  tins  in  the  street  ;  and  the</span><span>  Copperfield  brass  band,  very  naturally  deeming</span><span>  themselves  above  the  kerosene  standard,  went</span><span>  over  to  Clermont  and  struck  up  one  of  their</span><span>  stirring  airs.  In  an  instant  the  police  were</span><span>  down  upon  them,  and  they  had  to  desist  be-</span><span>  fore  concluding  the  piece.  This  is  said  to  have</span><span>  astonished  a  great  many  ;  and  certainly  to  con-</span><span>  found  the  brass  band  with  the  ""  discordant</span><span>  branch  ""  was  not  very  flattering,  but  least  of</span><span>  all,  we  should  think,  to  those  who  made the</span><span>  mistake.  As  it  was,  the  New  Year  was</span><span>  ushered  in  very  quietly,  and  we  don't  suppose</span><span>  that  any  one  was  the  worse  for  it,  while  some</span><span>  may  have  benefited  by  the  change.  Full</span><span>  liberty  of  the  subject  was  enjoyed  in  Rock-</span><span>  hampton,  and  the  New  Year  was  welcomed  in</span><span>  the  orthodox  fashion,  with  the  discharge  of</span><span>  squibs,  crackers,  and  rockets  ;  and  the  beating</span><span>  of  kerosene  tins,  old  kettles,  cracked  sauce-</span><span>  pans,  and  other  like  instruments  ;  while  the</span><span>  Volunteer  band  discoursed  in  dulcet  strains</span><span>  till  nearly  three  in  the  morning.  It  is  generally</span><span>  admitted  that  a  little  relaxation  now  and  then,</span><span>  so  long  as  it  is  kept  within  bounds,  is  almost</span><span>  a  necessity  in  the  present  condition  of  society,</span><span>  too  much  austerity  having  a  tendency  to  defeat</span><span>  its  object.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  a  cheerful  leading  article,  the  staple  of</span><span>  which  might  have  been  furnished  by  the</span><span>  Premier  himself,  the  Wide  Bay  News  classes</span><span>  the  Bulletin  among  the  ""  carrion  crows  of  the</span><span>  Opposition  who  gloat  over  the  thought  that</span><span>  the  Premier  has  committed  a  faux  pas."" The</span><span>  same  paper  says  that  Mr.  Douglas  ""  has, as</span><span>  far  as  we  know,  done  nothing  but  what  thou-</span><span>  sands  of  the  wisest,  the  oldest,  and  the best</span><span>  of  men  have  done,  and  he  will  find  imitators</span><span>  so  long  as  men  are  men  and  women  women.""</span><span>  What  does  the  writer  means  by  this  ?  Our</span><span>  charge  against  Mr.  Douglas  was  one  of  deli-</span><span>  berate  law-breaking—not  of  infringing</span><span>  any  moral  or  conventional  rule.  No  attempt</span><span>  is  made  to  repel  the  accusation,  yet  the  News</span><span>  writer  goes  on  to  say—""  If  in  this  sorry  busi-</span><span>  ness  he  has  acted  unwisely,  we  who  have</span><span>  known  him,  can  at  once  see  that  he  has  been</span><span>  guided,  to  his  own  hurt,  by  an  over  scrupu-</span><span>  lous  sensitiveness.  Be  that  as  it  may,  all  this</span><span>  is  purely  a  private  business.  As  a  public  man</span><span>  his  character  remains  without  a  blemish—he</span><span>  remains  the  one  statesman  we  have  in  Queens-</span><span>  land,  whose  only  fault  is  that  he  is  sometimes</span><span>  too  far  above  the  heads  of  the  Parliamentary</span><span>  herd  for  them  to  understand  him.  As  member</span><span>  for  this  town  he  remains  what  he  always  was—</span><span>  a  representative  of  whom  any  constituency</span><span>  may  be  proud,  and  one  of  the  best  friends  we</span><span>  have  had  in  Parliament.""  This  would  be</span><span>  highly  satisfactory,  no  doubt,  if  the  News</span><span>  editor  condescended  to  explain  what  it  is  all</span><span>  about.  How  has  Mr.  Douglas  "" acted</span><span>  unwisely,""  and  where  does  the  ""over  scrupu-</span><span>  lous  sensitiveness  ""  come  in ? Over-scrupulous</span><span>  sensitiveness  would  dictate  strict  regard  for</span><span>  law  and  order,  and  a  rigid  abstention  from</span><span>  equivocal  acts.  But  according  to  the  News</span><span>  Mr.  Douglas'  over-scrupulousness  has  made</span><span>  him  the  prey  of  ""  carrion  crows.""  It  must be</span><span>  a  sorry  business,  truly.</span></p> ",Article,1878-01-08,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin.</span><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  FEBRUARY  14,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THAT  the  plot  thickens  in  Europe  is  un-</span><span>  fortunately  but  too  apparent.  The</span><span>  duplicity  of  Russia  evidently  continues</span><span>  to  make  progress  along  its  sinuous  and</span><span>  sinister  course.  Prince  Gortschakoff</span><span>  engrosses  the  attention  of  British  and</span><span>  Austrian  diplomatists,  while  the  Russian</span><span>  Commander-in-chief  makes  unscrupulous</span><span>  use  of  the  wretched  Turkish  Govern-</span><span>  ment  for  the  accomplishment  of  Russia's</span></p> <p><span>  nefarious  designs.  We  are  told  that  at</span><span>  the  approaching  Conference  Great</span><span>  Britain  will  insist  upon  a  free  passage</span><span>  of  the  Dardanelles  —  presumably</span><span>  for  her  war  vessels  ;  complete  access</span><span>  to  the  Black  Sea  ;  and  full</span><span>  security  for  communication  through</span><span>  Egypt  with  British  India.  But  in</span><span>  the  meantime  ""  Russia  objects  to  certain</span><span>  points  in  the  peace  preamble,  and  also</span><span>  to  the  limitations  sought  to  be  imposed</span><span>  by  Austria.""  Then,  on  the  British  fleet</span><span>  being  ordered  to  Stamboul,  the  Russian</span><span>  Press—no  doubt  inspired  by  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment—remarks  that  this  step  was  advised</span><span>  by  Russia  in  the  historical  Berlin</span><span>  memorandum—as  much  as  to  say,</span></p> <p><span>  ""  That  would  have  been  reasonable</span></p> <p><span>  enough  before  the  war  ;  but  now,  with</span><span>  our  victorious  armies  in  occupation  of</span><span>  Constantinople,  the  situation  is  com-</span><span>  pletely  changed.""  Next  comes  the</span><span>  assurance  from  Prince  Gortschakoff  that</span><span>  the  British  fleet  having  been  ordered</span><span>  to  Stamboul  for  the  protection  of</span><span>  the  Christian  population,  the  Russian</span><span>  troops  would  occupy  the  city  with  the</span><span>  same  object.  And,  lastly,  we  learn  that</span><span>  the  Porte  refuses  the  firman  permitting</span><span>  the  (British)  fleet  to  come  up  to  Stam-</span><span>  boul,  on  the  ground  that,  the  Russians</span><span>  already  occupy  the  city.  The  meaning</span><span>  of  this  can  hardly  be  misunderstood.  It</span><span>  evidently  is  that  the  Russians,  being  in</span></p> <p><span>  occupation  of  Stamboul,  are  enabled  to</span><span>  dictate  its  foreign  policy  to  the  Porte.</span><span>  This  explains  the  enforced  resignation  of</span><span>  all  Turkish  foreign  officers,  as  well  as  the</span><span>  rumours  of  a  close  alliance  between</span></p> <p><span>  Turkey  and  Russia  on  the  basis  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  armistice  protocol.  It  is  plain  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  Czar  is  the  man  in  possession  at  Stam-</span></p> <p><span>  boul,  and  that  his  emissaries  direct  the</span><span>  foreign  policy  of  the  Sultan's  Govern-</span></p> <p><span>  ment.  There  is  every  reason  to  fear</span><span>  that  the  refusal  of  a  permit  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  British  fleet  to  come  to  Stamboul  is  a</span><span>  studied  insult  to  Great  Britain,</span><span>  deliberately  planned  by  Russia,  and</span><span>  offered  by  the  Porte  under  coercion.</span></p> <p><span>  The  rumoured  dalliance  between</span></p> <p><span>  Russia  and  Turkey  may  seem  incredible</span><span>  at  first  sight  ;  but  on  consideration  it  is</span></p> <p><span>  not  so.  Turkey's  old  allies  have  com-</span><span>  pletely  abandoned  her,  and  British</span></p> <p><span>  statesmen  have  repeatedly  proclaimed</span><span>  that  they  will  not  intervene  except  for</span><span>  the  protection  of  British  interests.  But</span><span>  what  does  Turkey  care  for  British</span><span>  interests  when  she  is  left  alone  to  grapple</span><span>  with  her  powerful  neighbour?  The</span><span>  policy  pursued  by  the  Great  Powers  is</span><span>  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  Sultan's</span></p> <p><span>  Government  can  only  exist  on  sufferance,</span></p> <p><span>  and  that  it  is  completely  at  the  mercy  of</span><span>  Russia.  Under  such  circumstances,</span><span>  what  is  more  natural  than  that  Turkey</span><span>  should  attempt  to  conciliate  a  neighbour</span><span>  whom  she  is  unable  to  resist  ?  If  the</span><span>  Ottoman  powers  continue  to  exist  at  all</span><span>  it  will  only  do  so  by  Russian  clemency  ;</span><span>  then  why  should  it  excite  surprise</span></p> <p><span>  that  the  humbled  Sultan  has  become</span></p> <p><span>  the  pliant  instrument  of  the  invincible</span><span>  Czar?</span></p> <p><span>  As  to  the  demand  of  Great  Britain</span><span>  for  free  access  for  her  war  vessels  to</span><span>  the  Black  Sea  it  is  one  that  can</span><span>  only  be  maintained  on  the  assumption</span><span>  that  Great  Britain  is  able  to  enforce</span><span>  it.  Such  access  is  a  privilege  conferred</span><span>  by  treaty,  no  doubt  ;  but  why  ?  Certainly</span><span>  not  because  Great  Britain  has  any</span><span>  abstract  right  to  send  ironclads  at</span><span>  pleasure  through  the  Dardanelles.  Great</span><span>  Britain  has  not  a  foot  of  land  north  of</span><span>  the  Hellespont,  The  Black  Sea  laves</span><span>  the  coasts  of  Russia  and  Turkey  alone  ;</span><span>  and,  apart  from  hereditary  claims,  none</span><span>  but  the  Governments  of  those  countries</span><span>  can  equitably  claim  free  access  for  their</span></p> <p><span>  war  vessels  to  Black  Sea  waters.  To  all</span><span>  intents  and  purposes  they  form  a  Russo-</span><span>  Turkish  lake,  and  there  is  much  in  the</span><span>  contention  that  quitably  the  Western</span><span>  Powers  can  only  ask  for  access  by</span><span>  sufferance.  It  is  quite  possible  also  that</span></p> <p><span>  Russia,  in  consideration  of  the  free</span><span>  navigation  of  the  Bosphorus  and  Dar-</span><span>  dandles,  has  offered  such  terms  of  peace</span></p> <p><span>  to  Turkey  as  appear  to  the  vanquished</span><span>  not  merely  just  but  also  generous.</span><span>  Russia,  for  example,  could  well  afford  to</span><span>  forego  the  fifty  millions  demanded  as  in-</span><span>  demnity  for  such  concession  ;  and  it  is</span><span>  clear  that  if  such  an  offer  were  made,</span><span>  the  Porte,  deserted  by  Europe  and  other-</span><span>  wise  anticipating  national  extinction,</span><span>  would  gladly  acquiesce.  Alliance  with</span><span>  Russia  has  become  the  last  chance  for</span><span>  the  ""sick  man.""</span></p> <p><span>  But  if  this  be  the  case,  the  situation  is</span><span>  a  most  humiliating  one  for  Great  Britain,</span><span>  the  former  arbiter  of  European  destinies,</span><span>  and  the  acknowledged  ""  mistress  of  the</span><span>  seas.""  And  it  is  scarcely  conceivable  that</span><span>  she  will  quietly  submit.  The  only  other</span><span>  Power  directly  in  crested  in  the  Dar-</span><span>  danelles  is  Austria,  but  Lord  Derby</span><span>  declares  that  she  cannot  be  depended</span><span>  upon  to  fight,  and  the  presumption</span><span>  follows  that  if  war  be  determined  upon</span></p> <p><span>  Great  Britain  will  have  to  do  battle</span></p> <p><span>  alone.  It  will  cost  little  to  blockade  the</span></p> <p><span>  Black  and  Baltic  Seas,  and  destroy  both</span></p> <p><span>  Russian  and  Turkish  maritime  commerce.</span><span>  But  British  commerce  would  suffer  as</span><span>  much  detriment  from  such  a  policy  as</span><span>  either  of  the  blockaded  countries.  And</span><span>  it  is  but  a  poor  consolation  that,  England</span><span>  being  richer  than  Russia  and  Turkey,  can</span><span>  better  afford  to  lose  than  either  of  them.</span></p> <p><span>  Taking  all  these  matters  into  con-</span><span>  sideration,  the  confusion  is  that  the</span><span>  time  for  British  interference  has  gone  by,</span></p> <p><span>  and  that  unless  the  decision  of  the  Con-</span><span>  ference  should  bring  allies  she  had</span><span>  better  pocket  the  Russo-Turkish  affront,</span><span>  and  seek  compensation  by  taking</span><span>  possession  of  Egypt.  To  that  course</span><span>  neither  Russia  nor  Germany  would</span><span>  strongly  object,  and  it  is  unnecessary  to</span></p> <p><span>  consult  the  susceptibilities  of  other</span><span>  Powers,  France  might  possibly  need  to</span></p> <p><span>  be  pacified,  but  that  might  be  done  by</span></p> <p><span>  resisting  the  German  project  to  annex</span></p> <p><span>  Belgium.</span></p> <p><span>  THAT  the  settlement  variously  known  as</span></p> <p><span>  Island  Point,  Salisbury,  and  Port  Douglas</span><span>  has  survived  its  early  perils,  is  shown  by  the</span><span>  publication,  on  Saturday  last,  of  a  full-sized</span><span>  newspaper  named  The  Port  Douglas  Times  and</span><span>  Cook  District  Advertiser.  The  proprietors  are</span><span>  Messrs.  R.  H.  Pearce,  E.  Rhode,  and  W.  M.</span><span>  Welsh,  the  first-named  being  well  known  in</span><span>  Rockhampton  as  a  writer  of  some  ability.  The</span><span>  new  journal's  opening  address  is  creditable,</span><span>  and  its  subscribers  will  be  glad  to  learn  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  existing  white-heat  condition  of  Queensland</span><span>  politics  that  the  paper  will  be  free  from  party</span><span>  bias,  and  aim  to  promote  the  general  good.</span><span>  The  Port  Douglas  Times  begins  with  a  fair</span><span>  show  of  advertisement,  and  will,  it  may  be</span><span>  hoped,  prove  remunerative  to  its  proprietors</span><span>  as  well  as  useful  to  the  public.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  members  of  the  Grammar  School  Com-</span><span>  mittee  met  at  the  Municipal  Chamber,  yester-</span></p> <p><span>  day,  for  the  purpose  of  inspecting  the  various</span></p> <p><span>  reserves  and  other  available  lands  for  a  school</span><span>  site.  They  were  accompanied  by  the  Secretary</span><span>  and  the  Town  Surveyor  the  latter  of  whom</span><span>  kindly  pointed  out  the  reserves,  and  stated</span><span>  their  respective  distances  from  town,  namely,</span><span>  the  corner  of  Quay  and  William  streets.  The</span><span>  party  first  drove  to  the  Recreation</span><span>  Ground,  which  the  town  Surveyor  stated</span></p> <p><span>  was  a  mile  and  a-half  from  town.</span><span>  The  site  available  was  found  to  be</span><span>  high  on  the  river  bank,  but  flanked  by  a</span><span>  swamp  and  intersected  by  two  gullies.  The</span><span>  Archer  and  Cambridge  streets  reserve  was  next</span><span>  inspected,  and  though  partly  of  low  ground</span></p> <p><span>  and  furnished  with  occasional  melonholes,</span><span>  was  found  to  be  capable  of  drainage,  and  also</span></p> <p><span>  not  inconvenient  in  regard  to  distance.  The</span><span>  area,  however,  is  limited,  as  it  contains  only</span></p> <p><span>  five  acres.  The  party  next  drove  towards  the</span><span>  Range,  and  on  the  way  inspected  another  five</span><span>  acre  reserve  near  the  foot  of  Hospital  Hill,</span><span>  but  this  presented  few  recommendations.</span><span>  The  Reserve  for  Government  House  was  the</span><span>  next  point  of  interest.  The  beauty  of  the  site</span><span>  was  apparent,  and  according  to  Mr.  Clements</span><span>  it  was  not  more  distant  from  town  than  the</span><span>  Recreation  Ground,  while  very  much  nearer</span><span>  the  railway  as  well  as  the  majority  of</span><span>  dwellings.  The  level  area  available  for  a</span><span>  playground,  however,  was  limited,  and  persons</span></p> <p><span>  most  in  its  favour  could  not  but  admit</span><span>  that  fielding  on  the  western  slope  in  a</span></p> <p><span>  cricket  match  would  be  rather  arduous</span><span>  labour.  The  site  in  Serocold's  paddock</span><span>  was  next  visited,  and  its  fitness  was  at  once</span></p> <p><span>  admitted  by  most  of  the  visitors.  Almost</span><span>  level,  yet  having  ample  slope  for  drainage,  and</span></p> <p><span>  being  on  a  moderate  elevation,  with  fine  clean</span></p> <p><span>  soil,  its  suitability  was  incontestable.  But</span></p> <p><span>  there  is  one  difficulty  apart  from  all  presumed</span><span>  drawbacks,  in  connection  with  this  site  :  its</span><span>  owner  is  in  England,  and  his  agents  can</span><span>  not  sell  without  applying  for  authority  to  do</span><span>  so.  The  old  Ulster  Arms  ground  was  next</span><span>  inspected,  but  found  few  advocates.  Lastly</span><span>  came  the  Primary  School  reserve  at  Allenstown,</span><span>  seven  acres  of  which,  it  is  believed,  could  be</span><span>  obtained  if  considered  suitable.  Some  dis-</span><span>  cussion  on  the  whole  question  took  place  at</span><span>  this  spot,  and  ultimately  the  Chairman  and</span><span>  Secretary  were  requested  to  prepare  a  draft</span><span>  report  for  submission  to  the  next  meeting,  to</span><span>  be  held  in  the  afternoon  of  the  21st  instant.</span></p> <p><span>  It  will  be  satisfactory  to  the  townspeople  to</span><span>  learn  that  tenders  are  invited  by  Mr.  Byerley</span><span>  for  ""sinking,  erecting,  and  concreting  the</span><span>  cast-iron  piers  of  the  Fitzroy  Bridge.""  The</span><span>  work  has  been  suspended  solely  on  account  of</span><span>  the  unforeseen  difficulty  encountered  in  getting</span><span>  up  the  cylinders  from  Sydney,  but  at  length</span><span>  satisfactory  arrangements  have  been  made</span><span>  with  that  object.  It  may  here  be  mentioned</span><span>  that  the  statement  of  our  Brisbane  correspo-</span></p> <p><span>  dent  as  to  the  rate  of  freight  asked  by  the</span><span>  A.S.N.  Co.  was  considerably  under  the  mark.</span><span>  The  freight  demanded  was  not  50s.  per  ton,</span><span>  but  £10  per  cylinder  of  2¾  tons,  or  at  the  rate  of</span><span>  about  72s.  per  ton.  This  being  deemed  pro-</span><span>  hibitory,  conveyance  by  sailing  vessel</span><span>  was  sought,  but  here  again  delay  was</span><span>  caused  by  something  like  a  combination</span><span>  among  the  brokers  to  exact  an  extravagant</span><span>  rate.  Ultimately,  however,  through  the</span><span>  firm  or  Messrs.  H.  M.  Hunter  and  Co.,  a</span><span>  vessel  was  chartered  to  bring  the  cylinders  at</span><span>  29s.  per  ton,  on  scarcely  more  than  one-third</span><span>  the  steamer  rate.  The  saving  thus  effected</span><span>  will  be  important,  and  more  than  compensate</span><span>  for  the  delay  caused.  Besides,  it  is  now  a  rule</span><span>  to  slack  off  Government  works  in  the  central</span><span>  and  northern  districts  between  Christmas  and</span></p> <p><span>  March,  because  experience  teaches  that  in-</span><span>  dependent  of  possible  flood  losses,  the  workman</span><span>  cannot  do  a  fair  day's  work  for  a  full  day's</span><span>  pay  at  that  season  of  the  year.  Mr.  Byerley</span></p> <p><span>  is  now  on  the  spot  doing  his  best  to  provide</span><span>  for  a  rapid  pushing  on  of  the  bridge,  and  we</span><span>  believe  there  is  enough  of  an  Englishman's</span><span>  love  of  fair  play  in  the  community  to</span><span>  make  attacks  upon  him  of  the  ""below-the-</span><span>  belt""  character  distasteful  to  every  intelligent</span><span>  and  impartial  person.  No  doubt  the  general</span><span>  opinion  is  that  all  large  works  should  be  done</span></p> <p><span>  by  contract,  but  when  a  public  officer  volun-</span><span>  teers  to  undertake  the  labour  and  response-</span><span>  bility  of  the  small  contract  system,  and  the</span></p> <p><span>  responsible  Minister  of  the  department</span><span>  sanctions  that  mode  of  carrying  out  the  work,</span><span>  it  is  unjust  to  maintain  a  perfect  fusillade  of</span><span>  criticism  as  the  work  proceeds.  The  Mary-</span><span>  borough  and  Mackay  bridges  were  built  on</span><span>  the  same  system  as  is  now  being  pursued  on</span><span>  the  Fitzroy  ;  and  as  the  two  former  structures</span><span>  are  regarded  as  faithfully  and  economically</span><span>  built,  the  department  may  with  good  reason</span><span>  contend  that  the  latter  will  turn  out  equally</span><span>  well.  In  starting  every  large  work</span><span>  there  are  unforeseen  delays,  as  well  as  un-</span><span>  foreseen  expenses  ;  for  it  is  impossible</span><span>  to  work  up  an  efficient  staff  without</span><span>  actually  testing  the  capabilities  of  men  a</span><span>  certain  proportion  of  whom  are  sure  to  turn</span><span>  out  ""duffers.""  Mr.  Byerley  is  confident  of</span><span>  completing  a  substantial  and  elegant  bridge</span><span>  for  about  the  sum  voted,  and  the  work  having</span><span>  been  placed  in  his  hands  he  must  be  permitted</span><span>  to  carry  it  out  in  his  own  way.  Those  who</span><span>  recollect  the  harassment  caused  by  presump-</span><span>  tuous  critics  during  the  construction  of  the</span><span>  Yeppen  Causeway,  the  utilisation  of  the  steam</span><span>  punt,  and  the  carrying  out  of  the  waterworks  ;</span><span>  and  who  also  recollect  how  quickly  the</span><span>  vapourings  of  newspaper  critics  and  amateur</span><span>  engineers  evaporate  when  those  undertakings</span><span>  one  after  another  proved  successful,  will  receive</span></p> <p><span>  the  predictions  now  being  rashly  launched  with</span></p> <p><span>  much  suspicion.  We  pronounce  no  opinion</span></p> <p><span>  about  the  bridge  works,  because  we  are  not</span><span>  competent  to  do  so.  At  the  same  time  we</span><span>  dispute  the  competency  of  nineteen  out  of</span></p> <p><span>  twenty  of  those  persons  who  are  constantly</span><span>  launching  wholesale  denunciations,  or  at-</span><span>  tempting  to  display  their  sagacity  by  technical</span><span>  criticism.  It  appears  to  us  that  the  present  is</span><span>  a  time  when  sensible  men  will  suspend  judg-</span><span>  ment  and  await  the  progress  of  events.</span></p> <p><span>  YESTERDAY  afternoon,  at  four  o'clock,  was</span><span>  the  time  advertised  for  holding  a  meeting  of</span><span>  parents  to  nominate  a  School  Committee  for</span><span>  the  ensuing  year.  At  a  quarter-past  four</span></p> <p><span>  only  three  gentlemen—Messrs.  W.  Thomson,</span><span>  J.  J.  Wood,  and  D.  Paterson—were  present.</span><span>  Mr.  Thomson  was  voted  to  the  chair,  and  read</span></p> <p><span>  the  circular  from  the  Education  Office  con-</span></p> <p><span>  vening  the  meeting.  He  thought  it  would  he</span></p> <p><span>  advisable  to  adjourn  to  an  hour  more  suitable</span><span>  for  the  attendance  of  the  parents.  The</span></p> <p><span>  suggestion  of  the  Chairman  was  adopted,  on</span><span>  the  motion  of  Mr.  Peterson,  seconded  by  Mr.</span><span>  Wood  ;  the  meeting  therefore,  stands  ad-</span><span>  journed  till  Friday  evening  at  eight  o'clock.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  evident,  from  the  unanimous  state-</span></p> <p><span>  ments  in  the  various  journals  with  regard  to</span><span>  the  condition  of  selectors,  that  a  very  large</span><span>  number  will  be  unable  to  pay  their  rents  when</span><span>  they  fall  due,  on  the  31st  March.  Selectors</span><span>  should  know  that  the  law  is  plain  on  the</span><span>  subject,  and  that  it  cannot  be  violated,  even</span><span>  by  the  Executive,  notwithstanding  the  very</span><span>  exceptional  circumstances  in  which  the  colony</span><span>  is  now  placed.  We  would  strongly  advise,</span><span>  therefore,  every  selector  who  can  at  all  raise</span><span>  his  rent  by  other  means,  not  to  look  for  aid  from</span><span>  the  Government.  For  those,  however,  who,</span><span>  after  all  their  efforts,  will  be  unable  to  pay,</span><span>  the  best  plan  would  be  to  send  petitions  to</span><span>  the  Executive  before  the  31st  March  ;  and</span><span>  these  might  be  advantageously  supplemented</span><span>  by  letters  to  the  Secretary  for  Public</span><span>  Lands  from  individual  selectors.  If</span><span>  this  course  is  followed  before  the  31st</span><span>  March,  there  is  very  little  doubt  the</span><span>  Parliament,  when  it  meets,  will  pass  a  short</span><span>  Relief  Bill  to  meet  the  exigencies  of  the  case.</span></p> <p><span>  OUR  Central  Coast  District  correspondent,</span><span>  writing  on  the  11th  instant,  says:—Stock  and</span><span>  station  matters,  now  that  mustering  is  done,</span><span>  are  very  quiet,  owners  of  stock  being  some-</span><span>  what  cheered  after  a  full  acquaintance  with</span><span>  their  loss,  at  the  improvement  now  manifested</span><span>  in  the  appearance  of  their  herds.  Anxiety,</span><span>  however,  still  continues,  as  the  rainfall  in</span><span>  many  places  has  been  so  slight  as  yet  that</span><span>  prospects  are  disheartening.  Reports  all</span><span>  along  the  coast  from  Toorilla  downwards  are</span><span>  everywhere  much  the  same—grass  plentiful,</span><span>  but  water  scarce.  A  good  three  or  four</span><span>  days  rain  would  be  a  boon  just  now.</span><span>  The  cultivation  —  little  though  it  be  —</span><span>  now  going  on,  promises  well.  Mr.  Hayes,  at</span><span>  Stony  Creek,  is  havresting  a  good  crop  of</span><span>  maize  from  a  few  acres  early  sown.  The  maize</span><span>  crop  at  Adelaide  Park  is  looking  well,  but</span><span>  rain  would  be  helpful  to  it.  Mr.  Corten's</span><span>  tobacco  is  looking  splendid—could  scarcely  be</span><span>  better,  and  Mr.  Jones'  beginning  with  the</span></p> <p><span>  same  crop  is  equally  promising,</span></p> <p><span>  OUR  leading  article  on  the  election  of  State</span></p> <p><span>  School  Committee  on  Monday  was  written</span></p> <p><span>  under  the  impression  that  the  plan  of  appoint-</span><span>  ment  adopted  last  year  would  be  followed  this.</span><span>  And  this  impression  was  strengthened  by  the</span><span>  circumstance  that  the  gentleman  who  kindly</span><span>  furnished  the  information  respecting  the  North</span><span>  Rockhampton  nominations  last  week,  accom-</span><span>  panied  it  by  the  intimation  that  five  persons</span><span>  only  had  been  nominated  purposely  to  avoid</span></p> <p><span>  the  invidious  distinction  resulting  from  the</span><span>  striking  out  of  names  by  the  Minister.  It</span><span>  now  appears,  however,  that  the  instructions</span></p> <p><span>  this  year  differ  from  those  issued  on  former</span><span>  occasions.  In  May,  1876,  teachers  were</span><span>  requested  by  the  Secretary  for  Public  Instruc-</span><span>  tion  to  convene  meetings  of  parents  ""for  the</span></p> <p><span>  purpose  of  nominating  not  less  than  seven  persons</span><span>  in  each  case,  from  whom  he  will  select  a  new  com-</span><span>  mittee""  On  the  10th  January,  1878,  the  instruc-</span><span>  tions  were  that  meetings  should  be  convened  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  purpose  of  nominating  not  less  than  five  nor</span><span>  more  than  seven  eligible  persons  to  form  a  com-</span></p> <p><span>  mittee  for  the  coming  year.  .  .  The</span></p> <p><span>  committee  will,  in  all  ordinary  cases,  consist</span><span>  of  only  five  persons.  Even  under  this  latter</span><span>  instruction  the  Minister  possibly  still  reserves</span><span>  the  power  to  discriminate  ;  but  we  frankly</span></p> <p><span>  admit  that  the  innovation  is  an  undoubted</span><span>  step  in  the  right  direction.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Evangelical  Standard  of  Saturday</span><span>  says  :—""  We  are  glad  to  notice  the  decided</span><span>  action  taken  by  the  friends  of  education  in</span><span>  Rockhampton  to  establish  a  Grammar  School</span><span>  in  that  town  for  both  girls  and  boys.  We</span><span>  congratulate  the  editor  of  the  Bulletin  on  the</span><span>  marked  change  in  his  tone  and  advocacy,  for</span><span>  we  do  not  forget  that  when,  during  the  last</span></p> <p><span>  session,  he  sat  in  Parliament,  he  was  found</span><span>  opposing  by  speech  and  vote  the  amount</span><span>  placed  on  the  estimates  by  the  Minister  of</span><span>  Education  for  the  Brisbane  Girls'  Grammar</span><span>  School.  The  very  vote  he  unsuccessfully</span><span>  opposed  is  now  made  an  argument  for  pre-</span><span>  cedent  to  support  the  object  desired.  This  is</span><span>  is  but  another  illustration  of  the  volatility  of</span><span>  opinion  which  is  produced  by  a  difference  of</span><span>  position  ;  and  we  rejoice  that  the  friends  of</span><span>  education  in  Rockhampton  have  secured  such</span><span>  an  advocate.""  All  this  would  be  edifying  as</span><span>  instructive  were  it  true.  But  if  our  conten-</span><span>  porary's  reference  is  to  Mr.Buzacott's  action</span></p> <p><span>  in  the  House,  it  is  based  upon  an  evangelical</span><span>  fiction.  A  reference  to  Hansard  of  Septem-</span></p> <p><span>  ber  5  will  show  that  the  late  member  for</span><span>  Rockhampton  voted  with  the  Government  on</span><span>  the  item  of  £300  for  the  Girls'  Grammar</span><span>  School.  As  to  his  speaking  against  it,  the  fact</span><span>  was  that  he  did  not  speak  at  all  in  the  discussion</span><span>  on  the  question.  But  files  of  the  Bulletin  prove</span><span>  that  he  wrote  in  favour  of  the  grant,  and  we</span></p> <p><span>  can  assure  the  Standard  that  he  also  advocated</span><span>  it  privately  in  the  House.  If  he  did  not  take</span><span>  part  in  the  discussion,  the  reasons  were  (1)  that</span><span>  the  majority  in  favour  of  the  vote  was  certain,</span><span>  and  (2)  that  he  was  weary  of  the  vain  babble-</span><span>  ment  by  which  the  session  was  protracted.</span><span>  Were  the  Standard  a  secular  journal  we  should</span><span>  expect  a  frank  apology,  but  our  previous</span></p> <p><span>  experience  shows  that  its  evangelicism  does</span></p> <p><span>  not  admit  of  the  simple  truth  being  spoken.</span></p> <p><span>  AN  UNPLEASANT  BEDFELLOW.—The  Geelong</span><span>  Advertiser  relates  the  following  extraordinary</span><span>  snake  story  :—"".Shortly  after  eight  o'clock  on</span><span>  the  evening  of  the  15th  instant,  the  youngest</span><span>  son  of  Mrs.  Giles,  of  the  township  of  Maude,  was</span><span>  bitten  in  the  back  by  a  black  snake.  The</span></p> <p><span>  accident  has  a  somewhat  sensational  aspect.</span><span>  The  boy,  who  was  four  years  of  age,  having</span><span>  been  put  to  bed  with  his  brother  Earnest,</span><span>  soon  afterwards  complained  that  Earnest  was</span><span>  tickling  him,  and  had  just  bitten  him  in  the</span><span>  back.  Mrs.  Giles,  thinking  that  something</span><span>  must  be  in  bed,  at  once  turned  up  the  clothes,</span><span>  when  she  was  horrified  at  the  sight  of  a  snake</span><span>  coiled  round  her  son's  body.  The  reptile,  be-</span><span>  coming  frightened,  escaped  out  of  the  bed,</span><span>  whilest  Mrs.  Giles  lifted  the  boy  up,  rushed</span><span>  into  the  kitchen  with  him  in  her  arms,  and</span></p> <p><span>  seizing  a  butcher's  knife,  cut  away  a  portion</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  skin  of  the  boy's  back,  on  which  their</span><span>  were  two  punctured  rounds,  and  then  sucked</span><span>  the  wound.  The  bite  must  have  been  a  very</span><span>  severe  one,  for  the  blood  trinkled  from  the</span><span>  wound  when  Mrs.  Giles  lifted  her  son  out  of</span><span>  bed.  The  boy  showed  symptoms  of  drowsiness</span><span>  for  several  hours  after  he  was  bitten,  but  the</span><span>  prompt  action  of  Mrs.  Giles  seems  to  have</span><span>  saved  his  life,  as  he  has  now  almost  re-</span><span>  covered.""</span></p> <p><span>  THE  WEATHER  FOR  1878.—As  the  weather</span><span>  is  an  important  question  at  all  times,  but</span><span>  especially  now,  we  take  the  following  prog-</span><span>  nostications  for  1878  from  Pugh's  Almanac  :—</span><span>  Calculations  for  1877  were  singularly  correct,</span><span>  with  the  exception  of  the  month  of  August,</span><span>  which  was  dry  instead  of  showery.  The  same</span><span>  plan  of  calculation  shows  probable  results  for</span><span>  1878  as  follows,  although  certainty  is  not  to  be</span><span>  expected  :—January  fair  at  first,  then  rain.</span><span>  February,  fair  with  short  intervals  of  fine</span><span>  weather,  and  much  rain  at  end  of  month.</span><span>  March,  much  rain  with  probable  floods.  April</span><span>  —first  and  last  part  of  month  wind  and  rain,</span><span>  fair  weather  second  and  third  weeks.  May,</span><span>  probably  on  the  whole  cold,  with  few  showers.</span></p> <p><span>  June,  cold  and  fair  throughout.  July,  rain</span><span>  first  half  of  mouth,  fair  and  frosty  third  week,</span><span>  and  stormy  at  the  close.  August,  cold</span><span>  throughout,  and  stormy  at  the  end  of  month.</span><span>  September,  a  cold  and  stormy  month.  October</span><span>  may  be  fair,  and  rain  alternately  ending  with</span><span>  storms,  November;  is  likely  to  usher  in</span><span>  a  wet  season,  with  December  abounding  in  damp</span><span>  and  rainy  days.  Drought  has  been  the</span><span>  principal  feature  of  1877,  but  1878  will  most</span><span>  likely  prove  its  compensating  character,  viz.:</span><span>  —A  wet  year,  affording  splendid  opportunities</span><span>  for  making  provision  for  water  for  future</span></p> <p><span>  seasons.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  TELEPHONE  AT  AN  ELECTION.—The</span></p> <p><span>  Philadelphia  Public  Ledger  of  the  eighth</span><span>  November  says  :—The  telephone  was  on</span><span>  Tuesday  evening  used  for  the  first  time  in</span></p> <p><span>  announcing  election  returns.  The  figures</span><span>  received  by  the  New  York  Tribune  were</span></p> <p><span>  transmitted  by  the  instrument  to  the</span><span>  American  Institute,  the  police  headquarters,</span><span>  Thirteenth-street  and  Broadway,  and  Twenty-</span><span>  third-street  and  Broadway,  and  still  other</span><span>  points  in  the  city,  for  the  first  time  in  the</span><span>  history  of  the  telephone  a  reporter  who  had</span><span>  never  before  seen  the  instrument  was  enabled</span><span>  without  practice,  almost  without  instruction,</span><span>  to  transmit  figures  with  perfect  accuracy.</span><span>  These  figures  were  received  and  recorded  in</span><span>  shorthand  by  a  stenographic  reporter  who  had</span><span>  never  seen  the  telephone  instrument,  and  were</span><span>  written  down  in  shorthand  as  fast  as  received.</span><span>  At  the  same  time  the  reporter  was  enabled  to</span><span>  read  aloud  the  figures  as  they  came  in.  The</span><span>  instrument  worked  with  great  precision  and</span><span>  rapidity,  and  a  practical  illustration  of  the</span><span>  speed  with  which  messages  are  communicated</span><span>  by  the  telephone  was  furnished  by  a  man  with</span><span>  a  stentorian  voice,  who  received  the  news</span></p> <p><span>  simultaneously  with  the  operators  in  the  same</span></p> <p><span>  office,  and  announced  the  results  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  crowds  long  before  bulletins  could  be  printed</span><span>  and  posted.</span></p> <p><span>  CRUELTY  PUNISHED.—A  charge  of  cruelty</span><span>  to  animals  (says  the  Argus)  was  heard  at  the</span><span>  Griffiths  Point  Police  Court  on  Saturday  last,</span><span>  in  which  Mr.  W.  Harbison,  a  local  justice  of</span><span>  the  peace  and  owner  of  property  on  Philip</span><span>  Island,  was  complained  against  for  omitting</span><span>  to  supply  certain  cattle  with  water.  The</span><span>  prosecution  was  instituted  under  section  23  of</span><span>  the  Police  Offences  Statute.  It  appeared  that</span><span>  on  the  15th  March  last  year  Mr.  Harbison,</span><span>  with  some  men  in  his  employ,  collected  a  mob</span><span>  of  cattle  and  horses  that  were  grazing  on  some</span><span>  unfenced  paddocks  belonging  to  him,  and  put</span><span>  them  into  a  closed  paddock.  One  of  the  wit-</span><span>  nesses  said  that  some  cattle  were  taken  from  the</span><span>  land  of  a  neighbour.  All  these  cattle  about</span><span>  76  in  number,  were  placed  by  Mr.  Harbison  in</span><span>  a  paddock  in  which  there  was  no  water,  and</span><span>  the  gate  of  which  was  locked  by  Mr.  Harbi-</span><span>  son's  direction.  In  this  place  the  animals</span><span>  remained  from  Thursday  till  the  following</span><span>  Monday  without  any  water.  For  the  defence,</span><span>  it  was  contended  that  the  act  did  not  apply  to</span><span>  any  persons  but  those  who  were  owners  of</span><span>  cattle,  or  those  who  were  in  some  way  in</span><span>  charge  of  them  ;  that  a  landowner  had  a  right</span><span>  to  impound  on  his  own  land  trespassing  cattle,</span><span>  and  was  under  no  legal  obligation  to  supply</span><span>  them  with  food  or  water.  Two  owners  of</span></p> <p><span>  cattle  that  were  impounded  had  seen  their</span><span>  cattle  in  Mr.  Harbison's  closed  paddock,  but</span></p> <p><span>  had  made  no  remonstrance  till  they  released</span><span>  the  animals  on  Monday.  The  bench  fined  the</span><span>  defendant  £5  5s.,  and  remarked  that  some  of</span><span>  the  cattle-owners  were  to  be  blamed  for  not</span></p> <p><span>  taking  steps  to  liberate  the  cattle  before  they</span></p> <p><span>  did.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  RABBIT  PLAGUE.—In  addition  to  the</span><span>  drought,  which  after  all  is  only  an  occasional</span></p> <p><span>  plague,  the  settlers  in  the  south-eastern</span><span>  portion  of  the  Wimmera  district,  or  on  the</span><span>  Loddon  and  Avoca  rivers,  and  in  the  neigh-</span><span>  bourhood  of  the  mallee  scrub,  have  now  to</span><span>  encounter  a  rabbit  scourge,  which,  unless</span><span>  grappled  with  speedily  and  effectually,  is</span><span>  likely  to  drive  them  back.  The  evil  has</span><span>  assumed  such  dimensions  that  the  Minister  of</span><span>  Lands,  having  come  to  the  conclusion  that</span><span>  individual  efforts  cannot  remedy  it,  intends</span><span>  next  session  to  bring  in  a  bill  to  give  local</span><span>  bodies  powers  that  they  do  not  now  possess,</span><span>  and  which  may  be  applied  to  reduce  the</span><span>  number  of  these  destructive  animals,  whose</span><span>  fertility  is  proverbial.  Various  unsuccessful</span><span>  devices  have  been  resorted  to  by  residents  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  locality  for  the  purpose  of  diminishing  the</span><span>  pest,  and  saving  their  crops  and  produce.</span><span>  Tons  of  poisoned  wheat  have  been  scattered</span><span>  broadcast,  but,  although  the  stench  of  the</span><span>  rabbits  so  killed  has  sometimes  been  over-</span><span>  powering,  there  had  been  no  perceptible</span><span>  diminution  of  their  numbers.  Moreover,  the</span><span>  medicated  grain  has  been  taken  by  sheep  and</span><span>  other  animals  for  which  it  was  not  intended.</span></p> <p><span>  One  farmer  chained  dogs  all  round  his  hay-</span><span>  stacks,  but  the  rabbits  found  thoroughfares</span><span>  through.  Another  proposes  erecting  a  picket</span><span>  fence,  sunk  deep  enough  to  prevent  the  rabbits</span><span>  from  burrowing  under  it.  One  or  two  of  his</span><span>  neighbours,  however,  who  are  disciples  of</span><span>  Darwin,  think  that  if  ""bunny""  proved  un-</span><span>  equal  to  the  occasion,  he  would  speedily  pro-</span></p> <p><span>  duce  descendants  with  powers  of  overcoming</span><span>  such  obstacles  between  them  and  crops  or  pro-</span><span>  duce  of  which  we  have  now  no  conception.—</span></p> <p><span>  Melbourne  Argus.</span></p> ",Article,1878-02-14,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  j  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  ----------</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  OCTOBER  25,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  telegrams  published  this  morning  show  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  plainly  that  Mr.  Griffith  has  got  himself  into</span><span>  hot  water  by  his  late  utterances  in  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  upon  the  railway  policy  of  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment.  This  is  only  what  everybody  who</span><span>  listened  to  him  here  expected,  as  the  views  he</span><span>  expressed  on  the  subject  were  in  material</span><span>  points  so  essentially  different  from  those  of  his</span><span>  colleagues,  that  it  was  impossible  to  under-</span></p> <p><span>  stand  how  he  could  adhere  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  policy  he  had  set  forth  and  still  remain  a</span><span>  member  of  the  present  Ministry.  It  appears</span><span>  that  the  Courier  has  accused  him  of  treachery</span><span>  to  his  party,  and  he  has,  in  reply,  published</span><span>  a  long  and  angry  letter  in  the  Telegraph,</span><span>  in  which  he  throws  discredit  upon  the  report</span><span>  given  by  the  Bulletin  of  his  after-dinner</span><span>  speech.  We  are  not  informed  as  to  what  part</span><span>  of  our  report  he  objects,  and  we  cannot,</span><span>  of  course,  undertake  to  maintain  its  accuracy</span><span>  in  every  particular  ;  but  we  say  without</span><span>  hesitation  that  it  was  on  the  whole  a  faithful</span><span>  report,  and  gave  the  substance  of  the  speech.</span><span>  Until  we  know  precisely  what  Mr.  Griffith</span><span>  has  stated  in  his  letter  to  the  Telegraph,  we</span><span>  are  not  in  a  position  to  defend  our-</span><span>  selves;  but  if  he  wishes  to  convince  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  people  of  Brisbane  that  on  the</span><span>  railway  question  he  said  nothing  in</span><span>  Rockhampton  which  is  not  in  accord  with  the</span><span>  deliverances  of  the  Premier  und  Colonial</span><span>  Treasurer,  he  will  find  some  difficulty  in</span></p> <p><span>  attaining  that  object.  In  his  speeches  in  &nbsp;</span><span>  Rockhampton  he  professed  not  to  be  aware</span><span>  of  any  important  difference  between  his  rail-</span><span>  way  policy  and  that  of  the  Government  of</span><span>  which  be  is  a  member  ;  but  recent  Parlia-</span><span>  mentary  records  and  published  addresses  are</span><span>  so  decidedly  against  him  that  his  uncon-  &nbsp;</span><span>  sciousness  of  disagreement  betrays  a  simplicity</span><span>  of  which  we  could  scarcely  have  believed  Mr.</span><span>  Griffith  capable.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  are  informed  that  the  present  trip  of</span><span>  The  Clarence,  s.s.,  to  Brisbane  and  Sydney,</span><span>  will  possibly  be  her  last  in  this  trade,  as</span><span>  negotiations  now  pending  for  the  sale  of  the</span><span>  steamer  will  probably  be  completed.  The</span><span>  Melbourne  Steamship  Company  purpose  run-</span><span>  ning  the  You  Yangs,  s.s.,  in  place  of  The</span><span>  Clarence,  and  with  that  intention  have  placed</span><span>  that  steamer,  so  long  and  favourably  known</span><span>  in  the  trade  between  Sydney  and  Melbourne,</span><span>  on  the  slip,  where  she  is  undergoing  a  thorough</span><span>  overhaul.  The  You  Yangs  will  leave  Sydney</span><span>  for  Brisbane  and  Rockhampton  on  Friday,</span></p> <p><span>  November  8.</span></p> <p><span>  The  new  stone-breaking  machine  together</span><span>  with  a  portable  steam-engine,  recently  pur-</span><span>  chased  by  the  Corporation  from  the  firm  of</span><span>  Messrs.  Munro  and  Co.,  Melbourne,  was</span><span>  landed  yesterday,  from  the  s.s.  Clarence,  in</span><span>  good  order.  The  experience  of  a  similar</span><span>  machine  in  Brisbane  has  been  highly  favour-</span><span>  able,  and  there  is  no  reason  why  a  different</span><span>  result  should  occur  in  Rockhampton.  One  of</span><span>  the  products  of  the  working  of  the  machine  is</span><span>  a  fine  stone  dust,  known  as  ""screenings,""  and</span><span>  which  is  of  great  service  in  making  asphalt.</span><span>  We  may  observe  that  the  forming  of  the</span><span>  water  channels  and  footpaths  of  the  principal</span><span>  streets  with  asphalt  is  being  necessarily</span><span>  delayed  until  a  supply  of  screenings  can  be</span><span>  obtained,  and  we  therefore  hope  that  the</span><span>  stone-breaker  will  answer  the  requirements  of</span><span>  the  town  by  turning  out  speedily  a  sufficient</span><span>  quantity  both  of  road  metal  and  screenings.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  inquiry  into  the  charges  preferred</span><span>  against  Dr.  Lightoller  by  several  of  the  immi-</span><span>  grants  by  the  Scottish  Bard  was  continued</span><span>  yesterday  morning  by  Dr.  Salmond,  Captain</span><span>  Hunter,  and  Mr.  E.  P.  Livermore.  Tho</span><span>  Board  deliberated  more  than  an  hour  and  came</span><span>  to  a  verbal  finding,  which  was  to  be  embodied</span><span>  in  writing  by  Dr.  Salmond,  and  delivered</span><span>  formally  to-day,  at  four  o'clock.  It  is  under-</span><span>  stood  that  the  evidenco  and  the  report  of  the</span><span>  Board  will  be  forwarded  to  the  Colonial</span><span>  Secretary  by  the  next  mail.  It  may  here  be</span><span>  mentioned  that  at  half-past  ten,  Mr.  Town-</span><span>  send,  the  schoolmaster  on  board  the  ship,</span><span>  laid  before  the  Board  an  address  to  Dr.</span><span>  Lightoller,  signed  by  twenty  of  the  passen-</span><span>  gers,  regretting  that  complaints  were  made</span><span>  against  him,  and  expressing  their  confidence</span><span>  in  him  in  thanks  for  his  professional  kindness</span><span>  during  the  voyage.</span></p> <p><span>  The  salute  fired  yesterday  afternoon  an-</span><span>  nounced  the  departure  of  the  barque  Scottish</span><span>  Knight  in  tow  of  the  Bunyip,  s.s.,  and  steam-</span><span>  tug  Mary  for  the  Central  Island  anchorage,</span><span>  where  she  will  complete  her  loading  for  Lon-</span><span>  don.  We  understand  there  are  upwards  of</span><span>  2600  bales  of  wool  and  124  tons  of  copper</span><span>  already  stowed  on  board  thce  vessel, and a further</span><span>  shipment  to  gether  with  50  tons  of  copper  were</span><span>  lightered  to  the  anchorage  yesterday.  Messrs.</span><span>  J.  Headrick  and  Co.,  the  agents,  expect  to</span><span>  forward  3500  bales  of  wool  by  the  Scottish</span><span>  Knight  in  time  for  the  February  sales,  and</span><span>  there  is  every  probability  of  her  clearing  at</span><span>  the  Customs  within  the  next  fortnight,  as  with</span><span>  the  wool  already  in  store,  an  additional  500</span><span>  bales  will  make  up  the  required  quantity,</span><span>  and  wool  is  now  coming  in  very  freely  by</span><span>  rail.  The  Scottish  Bard,  after  completing  the</span><span>  discharge  of  her  inward  cargo,  will  occupy</span><span>  the  London  berth  and  should  have  quick</span></p> <p><span>  despatch.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court  yesterday,  before  the</span><span>  Police  Magistrate  and  Messrs.  H.  Jones  and</span><span>  A.  L.  Bourcicault,  JJ.P.,  three  children,</span><span>  named  Hannah,  Mary,  and  Gertrude  Gough,</span></p> <p><span>  aged  respectively  eleven,  seven,  and  nine  &nbsp;</span><span>  years  of  age,  were  charged  under  the  Indus-</span><span>  trial  Schools  Act  with  being  neglected  children.</span><span>  It  appeared  from  the  evidence  elicited  that</span><span>  the  three  children  were  brought  to  the  Police</span><span>  Station  on  the  previous  morning,  by  an  elder</span><span>  brother,  who  stated  that  they  had  not  had  any</span><span>  meat  to  eat  for  a  week  previously,  and  had</span><span>  been  subsisting  on  the  charity  of  the  neigh-</span><span>  bours  ;  their  mother  had  gone  to  Kensington</span><span>  Downs  in  the  capacity  ol  a  nurse,  and  since</span><span>  her  departure  the  children  had  been  entirely</span><span>  neglected  by  their  father,  who  had  pawned</span><span>  the  furniture  in  the  house  to  obtain  drink,</span><span>  and  also  illtreated  the  children.  Senior-</span><span>  Sergeant  Brannelly  stated  that  he  had  visited</span><span>  the  house  of  John  Gough,  a  bricklayer,  and</span></p> <p><span>  the  father  of  the  children;  there  was  nothing  &nbsp;</span><span>  in  the  shape  of  food  in  the  house  and  no  bed-</span><span>  ding.  The  Committee  of  the  Orphanage  had</span><span>  declined  to  receive  the  children,  and  the  police</span><span>  were  unable  to  deal  with  them.  The  Bench</span><span>  remanded  the  children  until  this  morning  and</span><span>  directed  the  police  to  take  proceedings  against</span><span>  John  Gough,  the  father  of  the  children,  to com-</span><span>  pel  him  to  support  them.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  have  been  desired  to  call  attention  to</span><span>  the  extensive  sale  of  landed  properties  to  be</span><span>  held  by  Mr.  Curtis  at  his  auction  rooms  at</span><span>  eleven  o'clock  this  morning.  The  properties</span><span>  to  be  submitted  to  competition  comprise  a</span><span>  number  of  small  allotments  well  adapted  for</span><span>  cottage  residences,  and  persons  of  limited</span><span>  means  in  want  of  an  eligible  freehold  would</span><span>  do  well  to  attend  the  sales.-ADVT.</span></p> <p><span>  On  inquiry  at  the  Depot  last  night,  we  learn  &nbsp;</span><span>  that  the  demand  for  labourers  amongst</span><span>  the  immigrants  has  been  dull  for  the  past  two</span><span>  days.  The  single  girls,  as  usual,  have  nearly</span><span>  all  been  engaged,  and  there  are  now  only  two</span><span>  unemployed.  There  are  still  a  large  number</span><span>  of  single  men,  strong  healthy-looking  fellows,</span><span>  who  have  not  yet  found  work,  and  many  of</span><span>  them  seem  suited  for  farm  work.  The  married</span><span>  men,  with  families,  are  still  not  inquired  for,</span><span>  and  many  of  them  are  anxious  for  engage-</span><span>  ments.  &nbsp;</span><span>  The  timely  arrival  by  the  Aubrey  Peake,  &nbsp;</span><span>  from  Sydney,  of  the  balance  of  the  twenty-</span><span>  five  cylinders  required  for  the  Fitzroy  Bridge,</span><span>  has  enabled  Mr.  Byerley  to  push  on  the  bridge</span><span>  works  with  increased  vigour,  and  satisfactory</span><span>  progress  is  now  being  made  with  that  struc-</span><span>  ture.  Five  of  the  cast-iron  columns  are  now</span><span>  in  place,  and  the  cylinders  being  all  on  the</span><span>  ground,  the  remaining  five  columns  will  be  put</span><span>  in  with  despatch.  They  are  at  present  being</span><span>  carried  only  a  little  above  the  water  level,</span><span>  and  will  not  be  built  up  to  their  full  height</span><span>  until  the  rest  of  the  material  has  been  re-</span><span>  ceived.  The  concrete  of  the  north  abutment</span><span>  has  been  carried  up  to  the  level  of  the  ground</span><span>  and  the  masonry  facing  has  been  commenced.</span><span>  Thc  chain  channels  are  in  a  forward  state  of</span><span>  progress.  The  staging  for  the  adjustment  of</span><span>  the  cylinders  is  completed,  with  the  exception</span><span>  of  the  last,  which  will  be  erected  in  the</span><span>  course  of  a  week  or  ten  days.  Mr.</span><span>  Byerley  expects  the  whole  of  the  columns  for</span><span>  the  five  piers  will  be  in  position  by  Christmas.</span><span>  Advice  was  received  some  time  ago  that  the</span><span>  chains  for  the  bridge  had  been  shipped  by  the</span><span>  Scottish  Bard,  but  that  vessel  has  arrived</span><span>  without  them,  and  it  is  not  known  when  they</span><span>  are  likely  to  reach  Rockhampton.  There  will</span><span>  probably  be  no  interruption  on  that  account,</span><span>  however,  as  during  the  summer  months  from</span><span>  January  to  March,  the  works  will  have  to  be</span><span>  wholly  or  partially  suspended  in  consequence</span><span>  of  floods  or  freshets  in  the  river,  and  by  the</span><span>  time  the  cool  dry  weather  sets  in,  the  whole</span><span>  of  the  material,  chains  included,  will  doubt-</span><span>  less  have  arrived,  and  the  bridge  will  rapidly</span><span>  assume  shape.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  AOSTKAMAN  ELEVEN'.-The  Keening</span><span>  iftw«  reports  that  a  meeting  of  cricketers</span><span>  interested  in  tho  movement  for  preparing  to</span><span>  receive  the  Australian  team,  was  held  in</span><span>  Sydney  last  week,  when  the  following  nine-</span><span>  teen  players  were  chosen  to  practise,  and  from</span><span>  among  whomwill  bc  chosen  thc  team  to  meet  the</span><span>  invincibles,  viz.:-Messrs.

Mr.  Durack  aud  tho</span><span>  blackfellow  entered  tho  water  and  crossed  it,</span><span>  while  deceased  was  still  getting  ready  to</span><span>  ride  over.  He  in  turu  entered  the  stream  and</span><span>  managed  to  get  halfway  across  when  he  began</span><span>  to  slip,  and  instead  of  holding  on  to  the</span><span>  saddle,  as  told  by  Mr.  Durack,  he  held  on  to</span><span>  thc  reins,  and,  as  a  natural  consequence,</span><span>  pulled  the  horse  over  and  fell  off.  Both  Mr.</span><span>  Durack  and  tho  blackfellow  at  once  jumped  in</span><span>  to  save  him,  but  he  sank  immediately.  After</span><span>  a  short  time  they  saw  bubbles  rise  to  thc</span><span>  surface,  and  the  aboriginal  dived  and  brought</span><span>  him  up  to  theTsurfacc,  still  alive,  but  he  kept</span><span>  him  above  water  for  only  a  very  short  time,</span><span>  when,  getting  exhausted,  he  let  poor  young</span></p> <p><span>  Loewe  go,  who  at  once  sank,  never  to  risc</span><span>  again  alive.  Thc  nearest  habitation  to  the</span><span>  fatal  spot  was  a  cattle  station,  but  there  being</span><span>  no  one  at  home  Mr.  Durack  rode  at  once  to</span><span>  the  Custom-house,  aud  Mr.  Kiaeby  returned</span><span>  with  him  at  once.

The  publication  having  taken</span><span>  place,  however,  a  few  remarks  upon  the</span><span>  subject  seem  to  be  called  for.</span></p> <p><span>  We  may  state  for  the  enlightenment  of</span><span>  those  of  our  readers  who  have  not  taken</span><span>  the  trouble  to  study  the  correspondence,</span><span>  and  the  parliamentary  utterances  upon</span><span>  it,  that  in  the  first  week  of  January  last,</span><span>  Miss  Neill,  matron  of  the  ship  New-</span><span>  castle,  called  upon  the  Immigration</span><span>  Agent  in  Brisbane  for  the  payment  of</span><span>  her  maintenance  allowance  for  the  time</span><span>  she  had  been  in  the  colony,  and  this</span><span>  Mr.  Gray  pointedly  refused,  assigning  as</span><span>  his  reason  for  doing  so  that  her  conduct</span><span>  during  the  month  previous  to  that  date</span><span>  had  been  the  subject  of  public</span><span>  scandal.  During  the  time  the  Newcastle</span><span>  lay  off  the  wharves  at  Brisbane-about</span><span>  a  month-""  Miss  Neill,  notwithstanding</span><span>  that  there  was  no  other  female  on  board</span></p> <p><span>  the  ship,  lived  in  the  ship's  saloon  with</span><span>  Captain  Whereat.""  This  is  Mr.  Gray's</span><span>  statement,  and  it  was  on  this  account</span><span>  that,  when  she  applied  for  her  money,</span><span>  Mr.  Gray  refused  to  hand  it  over.  On</span><span>  the  following  day  he  received  an  indig-</span><span>  nant  and  insulting  letter  from  Captain</span><span>  Whereat  (of  the  Newcastle)  in  reference</span><span>  to  his  impertinence  to  the  lady  in  ques-</span><span>  tion  ;  and  assuming  Mr.  Gray  to  have</span><span>  made  the  charge  without  sufficient  foun-</span><span>  dation,  the  Captain's  letter  was,  perhaps,</span><span>  excusable  under  the  circumstances.</span><span>  However,  Mr.  Gray  at  once  addressed  a</span><span>  letter  to  Mr.  Macalister  narrating  what</span><span>  had  transpired,  and  remarking  that  he</span></p> <p><span>  would  doubtless  see  that  neither  the  ""</span><span>  Captain  nor  the  Matron  were  fit  persons</span><span>  to  be  employed  in  the  Immigration</span><span>  service.  Mr.  Gray  also  wrote  to</span><span>  the  Colonial  Secretary  on  the  sub-</span><span>  ject,  stating  that  Miss  Neill  had</span></p> <p><span>  also  lived  in  the  same  hotel  with</span></p> <p><span>  Captain  Whereat  from  the  time  the  ship</span><span>  arrived  in  Moreton  Bay,  until  she  moored</span><span>  at  the  wharf  ;  and  that,  since  the  receipt</span><span>  of  Captain  Whereat's  insulting  letter,  he</span><span>  had  made  a  few  inquiries,  and  found  that</span><span>  sufficient  evidence  was  forthcoming  to</span><span>  show  the  unfitness  of  the  Captain  and</span><span>  Matron  for  these  positions  ;  and  further</span><span>  remarking  that  he  thought  it  would  be</span><span>  advisable  to  request  the  Agent-General</span><span>  to  advise  Captain  Whereat's  owners</span><span>  accordingly.  Mr.  Gray,  it  will  be</span><span>  observed,  did  not  inform  Mr.  Douglas</span><span>  that  he  had  written  direct  to  the  Agent</span><span>  General  on  the  subject.  A  subsequent</span><span>  letter  from  Captain  Whereat  informed  Mr.</span><span>  Gray  that  in  the  event  of  any  action  or</span><span>  representation  of  his  tending  to  damage</span><span>  his  personal  or  professional  reputation,</span><span>  he  should,  at  whatever  cost  seek  from</span><span>  him  legal  redress  and  satisfaction  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  same.</span></p> <p><span>  The  omission  of  Mr.  Gray  to  inform</span><span>  the  Colonial  Secretary  of  the  better  he</span></p> <p><span>  had  written  to  London  was  a  serious</span></p> <p><span>  neglect  of  duty  which  is  condoned  by</span><span>  the  circumstances  disclosed  that  he,  as</span><span>  Immigration  Agent,  is  accustomed  to</span><span>  correspond  direct  with  the  Agent-General</span></p> <p><span>  as  the  head  of  the  Immigration  Depart-  j</span></p> <p><span>  ment.  A  matter  of  this  kind  un-</span></p> <p><span>  doubtedly  should  have  been  acted  upon</span><span>  only  with  the  knowledge  and  approval  of</span><span>  the  Minister  in  charge  of  the  depart-</span><span>  ment.  Mr.  Douglas  censures  Mr.  Gray</span><span>  for  this  omission,  but  unfortunately  he</span><span>  himself  committed  a  more  grevious</span><span>  fault,  or  blunder,  in  regard  to  the  same</span><span>  matter,  by  attaching  a  memo  to  Mr.</span><span>  Gray's  letter  to  himself  as  Colonial</span><span>  Secretary  of  a  most  unjustifiable  kind.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  as  follows  :</span></p> <p><span>  Captain  Whereat's  letter  to  Mr.  Gray  is  a</span><span>  most  intemperate  one.  Without  imputing</span><span>  any  improper  conduct  to  Miss  Neill,  it  was  far</span><span>  from  discreet  in  her  to  live  as  she  did  on</span><span>  board  the  Newcastle  while  at  the  wharf.</span></p> <p><span>  A  copy  of  this  correspondence  may  be  for-</span><span>  warded  to  the  Agent-General.</span></p> <p><span>  Miss  Neill,  I  understand,  lias  done  service</span><span>  as  a  matron,  and  I  don't  think  that  anything</span><span>  short  of  a  definite  charge  should  stand  against</span></p> <p><span>  her.</span></p> <p><span>  The  letter  with  this  memo,  appended</span><span>  was  sent  to  Mr.  Macalister,  who  wrote</span><span>  back  in  reply-""Giving  effect  to  the</span><span>  marginal  note  in  your  letter,  I  have</span><span>  again  engaged  Miss  Neill  to  take</span><span>  charge  of  an  early  ship,  but  have</span><span>  given  instructions  that  Captain  Whereat</span><span>  shall  not  be  again  employed.  And  by</span><span>  same  mail  Mr.  Macalister  acknowledged</span><span>  the  receipt  of  the  letter  he  had  received</span><span>  from  Mr.  Gray  direct,  remarking  that  he</span><span>  had  received  a  letter  of  later  date  from</span><span>  the  Colonial  Secretary,  from  which  he</span><span>  gathered  that  the  complaint  against  Miss</span><span>  Neill  had  assumed  a  modified  form,  in</span><span>  consequence  of  which  he  had  again</span><span>  engaged  her  as  matron  ;  but  with  respect</span><span>  to  Captain  Whereat,  and  having  regard</span><span>  to  the  intemperate  character  of  his  letter,</span><span>  he  had  given  instructions  that  he  should</span><span>  not  be  engaged  again.</span></p> <p><span>  It  would  appear  that  it  was  not  until</span><span>  the  receipt  of  this  letter  from  Mr.  Mac-</span><span>  alister  that  Mr.  Gray  became  aware  that</span><span>  the  Colonial  Secretary  had  overruled  his</span><span>  objections  without  asking  for  further</span><span>  information  or  in  any  way  consulting</span><span>  him  respecting  them.  Mr.  Douglas,  in</span><span>  defence  of  his  action,  stated  in  the</span><span>  Assembly  that  he  had  made  inquiries  into</span><span>  the  matter  from  Miss  Neil!  herself,</span><span>  who  had  called  upon  him  on  the  subject,</span><span>  and  had  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the</span><span>  charges  against  her  were  not  substan-</span><span>  tiated,  as  he  states,  indeed,  in  his  memo,</span></p> <p><span>  to  Mr.  Macalister-""  I  don't  think  that</span></p> <p><span>  anything  short  of  a  definite  charge</span><span>  should  stand  against  her.""</span></p> <p><span>  Such  an  act  of  indiscretion  in  a  man</span><span>  occupying  the  high  and  responsible  posi-</span><span>  tion  of  Colonial  Secretary  and  Premier</span><span>  is  incomprehensible.  Mr.  Gray  had  in-</span><span>  formed  him  in  writing  that  sufficient</span><span>  evidence  was  forthcoming  to  prove  the</span><span>  charges  which  had  been  preferred.  Then</span><span>  why  did  not  Mr.  Douglas  instruct  Mr.</span><span>  Gray,  or  the  Under-Colonial  Secretary,</span></p> <p><span>  or  both  gentlemen,  to  institute  a  proper</span><span>  inquiry  whilst  the  opportunity  existed  of</span><span>  getting  at  the  facts  ?  His  failure  to  do</span></p> <p><span>  so  shows  an  unaccountable  recklessness</span></p> <p><span>  in  regard  to  the  characters  of  the  persons</span><span>  aspersed,  and  also  to  the  proper</span><span>  conduct  of  the  immigration  busi-</span><span>  ness  of  the  colony.  A  matron</span><span>  in  charge  of  a  large  «umber  of  single</span><span>  girls  during  a'long  voyage  should  be</span><span>  above  reproach  or  even  suspicion,  and</span><span>  the  moral  character  of  the  captain  of  an</span><span>  immigrant  vessel  is  also  of  the  greatest</span><span>  importance.  The  captain  is  not  to  be</span><span>  again  employed  in  the  service,  but  the</span><span>  matron  is  re-engaged  ;  but  for  what  rea-</span><span>  son  ?  She  may  be  all  that  could  be</span><span>  desired,  but  when  ugly  rumours  are</span><span>  floating  about,  affecting  the  reputation  of</span><span>  a  lady  employed  as  a  matron  on  board</span><span>  the  immigration  vessels  of  this  colony,</span><span>  those  rumours  must  be  disproved,  or  the</span><span>  person  whose  character  is  assailed  must</span><span>  stand  aside  whilst  any  reasonable  doubt</span><span>  remains  as  to  her  moral  qualifications</span><span>  for  the  position.  During  the  debate  in</span><span>  the  Assembly  on  this  subject,  Mr.  Bell</span></p> <p><span>  stated  that  he  was  staying  at  the  hotel  j</span><span>  in  question  when  the  captain  and  matron</span><span>  were  there,  and  their  conduct  was  far</span><span>  from  correct,  as  could  easily  be  proved.</span><span>  After  such  a  statement  as  this,  in  addi-</span><span>  tion  to  the  charges  previously  made,  it  is</span><span>  the  imperative  duty  of  the  Government</span><span>  to  make  a  thorough  investigation,  and</span><span>  endeavour  for  the  sake  of  all  concerned</span></p> <p><span>  to  elicit  the  whole  truth,  and  ascertain  j</span><span>  whether  the  charges  are  true  or  false.</span></p> <p><span>  As  regards  the  ^//»«-Suspension  of</span><span>  Mr.  Gray,  there  cannot  be  a  ques-</span><span>  tion  that  he  acted  improperly</span><span>  in  furnishing  information  to  Mr.  Bell</span><span>  that  he  withheld  from  the  Colonial  Secre-</span></p> <p><span>  tary.  Mr.  Douglas  in  referring  to  this</span><span>  matter  mentions  the  fact  that  Mr.  Gray</span><span>  is  related  to  Mr.  Bell;  but  this  would  be</span><span>  no  aggravation  or  palliation  of  the  error</span><span>  committed.  It  is,  however,  to  be</span><span>  inferred  from  the  facts  disclosed</span><span>  that  Mr.  Bell  was  one,  at  least,</span><span>  of  Mr.  Gray's  informants,  and</span><span>  whilsthe  gave  information  it  was,  perhaps,</span><span>  almost  inexcusable  in  Mr.  Gray  to  throw</span><span>  aside  official  reserve  and  show  Mr.</span><span>  Bell  the  letters  received  on  the  subject</span><span>  from  the  Agent-General.  Mr.  Douglas</span><span>  however,  rightly  requires  an  explanation</span><span>  from  Mr.  Gray  of  his  conduct,  and  an</span></p> <p><span>  admission  of  the  error  committed.  Less</span><span>  than  this  would  be  inconsistent  with  the</span><span>  proper  administration  of  the  Government</span><span>  service.  But  Mr.  Douglas  has  to</span><span>  answer  for  more  culpable  conduct,  and</span><span>  the  Parliament  and  country  will  be  his</span><span>  judges.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  honourable  members  for  Rockhampton</span><span>  and  Blackall,  taking  advantage  of  a  temporary</span><span>  lull  in  political  strife,  have  returned  to  their</span><span>  homes  for  a  week  or  two.  It  is  satisfactory  to</span><span>  learn  that  these  gentlemen,  although  sitting</span><span>  on  opposite  sides  of  the  House,  have  found  a</span><span>  common  ground  in  the  advocacy  of  district</span><span>  interests,  and  that  their  united  influence  was</span><span>  brought  to  bear  upon  the  Ministry  on  the  all</span><span>  important  railway  question  last  week.  We</span><span>  have  reason  to  believe  that  both  our  members</span><span>  long  since  arrived  at  the  conclusion  that</span><span>  neither  party  in  the  Assembly  engrosses  all</span><span>  the  political  virtue  of  thc  House,  and  that</span><span>  an  independent  support  may  be  given  to</span><span>  cither  side  without  necessarily  sacrificing  thc</span><span>  interests  of  their  constituents.  Of  course,</span><span>  holding  thc  opinions  wc  do,  we  cannot  under-</span><span>  stand  how  any  public  man,  representing  a  cen-</span><span>  tral  or  northern  constituency,  can  throw  in  his</span><span>  lot  with  the  present  Ministry;  still,  we  admit</span><span>  that  a  member  of  Parliament,  in  party  mat-</span><span>  ters,  is  entitled  to  exercise  the  right  of  private</span><span>  judgment  so  long  as  the  interests  of  the  colony</span><span>  are  not  prejudiced  by  his  action.  Mr.  Mac-</span><span>  donald  has  had  much  to  contend  against  since</span><span>  he  entered  Parliament.  For  four  years  he  was</span><span>  heavily  handicapped  by  a  personal  grievance,</span><span>  and  his  position  was  rendered  still  more  in-</span><span>  vidious  by  a  change  of  sides.  A  third  disad-</span><span>  vantage  under  which  he  laboured  arose  out  of</span><span>  the  fulsome  adulation  constantly  lavished  upon</span><span>  him,  and  the  exaggerated  importance  at-</span><span>  tached  to  his  representations  by  injudicious</span><span>  Press  advocates.  Mr.  Macdonald  never  pre.</span><span>  tended  to  be  a  leading  member  of  the</span><span>  Assembly,  and  the  incessant  parading  of  his</span><span>  herculean  legislative  feats,  which  has  been</span><span>  constantly  practised,  must  have  been  as</span><span>  distasteful  to  him  as  it  was  objectionable  to</span><span>  the  intelligent  portion  of  the  public.  Since</span><span>  thc  disposal  of  his  personal  claims,  the  useful,</span><span>  ness  of  thc  hon,  member  for  Blackall  has</span><span>  apparently  increased,  and,  now  that  his  dis-</span><span>  ability  has  been  removed,  we  shall  be  always</span><span>  ready  to  give  him  full  credit  for  services  ren-</span><span>  dered  to  the  public.  But  this  does  not  imply</span></p> <p><span>  an  endorsement  of  the  invidious  distinctions</span><span>  drawn  between  his  efforts  and  those  of  other</span></p> <p><span>  hon.  members  who  are  at  least  equally</span><span>  capable  and  attentive.  Mr.  Macfarlane,  as  a</span><span>  new  member  who  has  at  once  taken  a  good</span><span>  position  in  tile  Assembly,  is  entitled  to  appre-</span><span>  ciative  recognition,  but  Mr.  Macdonald,  after</span><span>  five  years*  of  service,  must  perceive  that  hi«</span><span>  reputation  will  not  bc  improved  or  popularity</span><span>  increased  by  the  frequent  administration  oF</span><span>  sycophantic  praise.  Iiis  own  actions  will  speak</span><span>  more  loudly  than  the  inflated  words  of  a</span><span>  journalist  who  recognises  no  medium  between</span><span>  buttering  a  patron  and  smoking  an  opponent.</span></p> <p><span>  BY  yesterday's  post  our  English  files  to  May</span><span>  10  came  to  hand,  riA  Suez-Melbourne  ;  but</span><span>  owing  to  pressure  upon  our  space,  extracts  are</span><span>  necessarily  deferred.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  are  glad  to  learn  that  signatures  to  the</span><span>  Railway  Petition  are  coming  in  from  the</span><span>  Western  district,  and  that  opinion  there  is</span><span>  unanimously  in  favour  of  the  westerly  route.</span><span>  One  sheet  of  signatures  suggests  reflections</span></p> <p><span>  on  the  extension  of  settlement  in  the  far</span></p> <p><span>  West.  A  few  weeks  ago,  in  advocating  thc</span><span>  additional  member  for  the  ""&lt;1rcgory,""  Mr.</span><span>  Morehead  adduced  some  startling  fiqures  as</span><span>  to  the  progress  made  in  thc  West  since  the</span><span>  last  redistribution  of  electorates.  This  sheet</span><span>  of  signatures  supplies  confirmatory  cvideuce</span><span>  of  the  fact.  It  comes  from  Wellshot  station,</span><span>  which  in  1872  was  unoccupied,  and  was  about</span></p> <p><span>  that  time  thc  scene  of  the  murder</span><span>  of  the  late  Mr.  Welford.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  SEPTEMBER  5,  1876.</span></p> <p><span>  A  BILL  to  make  better  provision  for  the</span><span>  establishment  and  management  of</span><span>  Asylums  for  Orphans  and  Destitute</span><span>  Children,  was  read  a  first  time  in  the</span><span>  Legislative  Assembly  on  the  28th  ultimo,</span><span>  and  its  .second  reading  is  set  down  for</span><span>  next  Wednesday,  the  r  nh  instant.  The</span><span>  Parlkmentary  session  having  already</span><span>  virtually  ended,  there  is  no  prospect  of</span><span>  this  bill  being  proceeded  with  at  the</span><span>  present  time.  This  is  much  to  be  re-</span><span>  gretted,  as  the  subject  it  proposes  to</span><span>  deal  with  is  sorely  in  need  of  wholesome</span><span>  legislative  interference,  and  the  bill  is</span><span>  evidently  capable  of  being  made  a  useful</span><span>  Statute.  Being  a  social  question,</span><span>  however,  it  excites  little  notice</span><span>  from  our  law-makers,  and  year  after  year</span><span>  a  similar  measure  has  been  introduced  or</span><span>  promised,  apparently  for  no  better  purpose</span><span>  than  to  fill  a  space  in  the  Ministerial  pro-</span><span>  gramme  for  the  time  being.  A  new  Parlia-</span><span>  ment  will  shortly  assemble,  but  the  first</span><span>  session  after  a  general  election  is  of</span><span>  necessity  largely  devoted  to  talk,  and  we</span><span>  have  no  sanguine  expectations  of  this</span><span>  Orphanage  Bill  being  passed  for  some</span><span>  time  to  come.  It  wUl  be  our  duty,</span></p> <p><span>  however,  to  call  attention  to  the  subject,</span><span>  and  we  tnr  t  that  electors  will  not  forget</span><span>  to  bring  it  under  the  notice  of  candidates</span><span>  for  Parliamentary  responsibilities.</span></p> <p><span>  The  bill  provides  that  it  shall  be  law-</span><span>  ful  for  the  Governor-in-Council  to  estab-</span><span>  lish,  for  the  purposes  of  this  Act,  one  or</span><span>  more  Public  Orphanages  or  Asylums  for</span><span>  the  reception  and  care  of  orphans  or</span><span>  deserted  or  neglected  children  ;  and  that</span><span>  the  Diamantina  Orphanage  at  Brisbane</span><span>  and  the  Orphanage  at  Rockhampton,</span><span>  already  established,  shall  be  deemed  to</span><span>  be  public  orphanages  under  this  Act.</span><span>  The  Governor-in-Council  may  appoint</span><span>  Superintendents  and  Matrons,  and  the</span><span>  ""  Minister  ""  (probably  the  Secretary  for</span><span>  Public  Instruction)  may  from  time  to</span><span>  time  appoint  fit  and  proper  persons  to  be</span><span>  teachers,  officers,  and  servants  at  any</span><span>  Public  Orphanage.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  further  provided  that  the  Gover-</span><span>  nor-in-Council  may  place  any  public</span><span>  orphanage  under  the  charge  of  a  Com-</span><span>  mittee  of  Management,  consisting  of  ""one</span><span>  or  more  persons,""  subject  to  such  control</span><span>  of  the  Minister  as  shall  be  prescribed  in</span><span>  the  order  by  which  the  committee  are</span><span>  appointed,  or  by  any  regulations  made</span></p> <p><span>  under  this  Act.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  provision  is  that  any</span><span>  orphanage  established  by  private  benevo-</span><span>  lence  may  be  brought  under  the  Act,</span><span>  if  the  managers  of  the  institution  so</span><span>  desire,  as  a  ""  Licensed  Orphanage,""  by</span><span>  which  the  managers  shall  (subject  to</span><span>  such  control  as  shall  from  time  to  time</span><span>  be  prescribed  by  the  Governor-in</span><span>  Council)  have  the  whole  management</span><span>  and  supervision  thereof  ;  and  all  moneys</span><span>  appropriated  by  Parliament  for  the</span><span>  purpose  of  such  orphanage  shall  be</span><span>  entrusted  to  such  managers,  provided</span><span>  detailed  accounts  of  the  expendi-</span><span>  ture  shall  be  furnished  to  the</span><span>  Minister.  In  other  respects  such  Licensed</span><span>  Orphanage  and  the  inmates  thereof  shall</span><span>  be  subject  to  all  the  provisions  of  this</span><span>  Act  respecting  Public  Orphanages  and</span><span>  their  inmates.  Any  license  under  this</span><span>  section  may,  however,  be  withdrawn</span><span>  upon  six  months'  notice.</span></p> <p><span>  The  bill  also  provides  that  any  child</span><span>  under  twelve  years  of  age  who  shall  be</span><span>  found  in  the  colony  without  father  or</span><span>  mother,  or  who  shall  be  deserted</span><span>  by  its  father  or  mother,  or  whose</span><span>  father  or  mother  shall  be  unable  to  sup-</span><span>  port  it,  and  any  child  found  in  a  state  of</span><span>  destitution,  or  without  any  means  of</span><span>  support,  may  be  sent  to  an  orphanage</span><span>  upon  such  authority  and  subject  to  such</span><span>  conditions  as  may  be  prescribed  by</span><span>  regulations.  Children  so  admitted  may</span><span>  be  retained  in  an  Orphanage  at  the  dis-</span><span>  cretion  of  the  Minister,  until  they</span><span>  shall  have  attained  thé  age  of  thir-</span><span>  teen  years,  but  in  certain  cases  the</span><span>  period  may  be  extended  until  the</span><span>  inmate  has  reached  the  age  of  sixteen</span><span>  years.  We  are  glad  to  see  that  ample</span><span>  provision  is  made  to  compel  parents,  or</span><span>  step  parents,  who  have  the  means,  to  con-</span><span>  tribute  to  the  support  of  their  children</span><span>  while  in  an  orphanage  ;  and  the  Super</span><span>  intendent  of  an  orphanage,  with  the</span><span>  consent  in  writing  of  the  Minister,  is</span><span>  authorised  and  required  to  manage</span><span>  and  demise  for  any  term  not</span><span>  exceeding  three  years  the  lands</span><span>  of  or  to  which  any  inmate  is</span><span>  seized,  possessed,  or  entitled,  and  shall</span><span>  and  may  make  allowances  to  and</span><span>  arrangements  with  all  or  any  of  the</span><span>  tenants  or  occupiers  for  the  time  being  ;</span><span>  and  in  all  matters  in  respect  of  such</span><span>  property  shall  look  after  the  interest  of</span><span>  the  inmate  to  whom  it  belongs.</span><span>  Ministers  of  religion  are  to  have  access</span><span>  to  public  orphanages  for  the  purpose  of</span><span>  teaching  any  of  the  inmates  who  are</span><span>  members  of  their  respective  religious</span><span>  denominations,  but  subject  to  such</span><span>  restrictions  as  to  time  for  imparting</span><span>  instruction  as  the  Minister  may  impose.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  important  part  of  the  bill</span><span>  aims  at  the  introduction  into  this</span><span>  colony  of  the  Lodging  and  Boarding-out</span><span>  System.  The  Minister  may  permit  any</span><span>  inmate  of  any  Orphanage  under  this  Act</span><span>  to  lodge  at  the  dwelling  of  any  trust-</span><span>  worthy  and  respectable  person,  so  that</span><span>  the  child  be  taught,  trained,  clothed,</span><span>  and  fed  in  the  Orphanage  as  if  he  were</span><span>  lodging  in  the  Orphanage  itself.  As</span><span>  the  Minister  may  at  any  time  after  the</span><span>  admission  of  a  child  to  an  Orphanage,</span><span>  by  license  under  his  hand  permit  him  to</span><span>  Jive  with  any  trustworthy  and  respectable</span><span>  person  named  in  the  license,  and  willing</span><span>  to  receive  and  take  charge  of  him.  But</span><span>  such  child  shall  nevertheless  be  deemed</span></p> <p><span>  an  inmate  of  the  orphanage.  Any  such</span></p> <p><span>  license  shall  not  be  in  force  for  more</span><span>  than  three  months,  but  may  from  time  to</span><span>  time  be  renewed.  Or  the  license  may</span><span>  at  any  time  be  revoked  by  the  Minister.</span><span>  This  system  has  worked  with  the  best</span><span>  results  in  Victoria  and  South  Australia,</span><span>  and  its  introduction  into  this  colony  is</span><span>  much  to  be  desired.  It  in  many  cases</span><span>  provides  a  home  with  its  kindly  in-</span><span>  fluences  in  such  a  manner  as  is  not  pos-</span><span>  sible  in  a  public  institution.</span></p> <p><span>  From  the  general  sketch  we  have</span><span>  given  of  its  provisions,  it  will  be  seen</span><span>  that  the  bill  is  a  good  one,  and  should</span><span>  have  been  pushed  through  the  House</span><span>  without  delay.  We  trust,  however,  that</span><span>  it  will  be  taken  in  hand  and  passed  next</span></p> <p><span>  year.</span></p> <p><span>  TITE  Volunteers  of  both  companies  will</span><span>  parade  at  the  Drill  Ground  this  evening  at</span><span>  eight.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  usual  monthly  meeting  of  No.  C  Build-</span><span>  ing  Society,  will  be  held  in  the  Secretary's</span><span>  offioes  to  night  at  7*30.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Court  of  Revision  of  the  Temporary</span><span>  Electoral  ROIIB  under  the  Electoral  Districts</span><span>  Act  of  1878,  adjourned  from  Tuesday,  will</span><span>  meet  at  thc  Court  House  thiB  morning  at  ten.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Diorama  was  not  so  largely  attended  as</span><span>  usual  last  night,  but  the  audience  seemed  as</span><span>  interested  as  ever.

A  shipment  of  chains  is</span><span>  expected  in  October  by  thc  Scottish  Bard,  and</span><span>  00,000  feet  of  timber  for  the  decking  of  the</span><span>  bridge  has  just  arrived.  This,  with  the  tim-</span><span>  ber  already  on  hand,  supplies  about  half  of  thc</span><span>  quantity  required.

Of  this  latter</span><span>  amount,  £20,000  is  for  a  dredge,  £10,000  for</span><span>  plant,  &c,  and  £10,000  for  general  pur-</span><span>  poses  in  connection  with  thc  river  improv</span><span>  ments.  The  small  dredge  at  present  in</span><span>  the  river  will  probably  be  set  to  work  again</span><span>  soon,  as  it  has  now  several  additional  punts,</span><span>  and  all  that  ie  now  required,  we  believe,  is  the</span><span>  set  of  buckets  ordered  but  which  have  not  as  yot</span><span>  come  to  hand.  This  dredge  is  too  small  to  be</span><span>  of  much  use  in  the  Fitzroy,  but  it  will  doubt-</span><span>  less  help  to  clear  out  the  channel  at  the  Upper</span><span>  Flats  as  the  construction  of  thc  retaining  wall</span><span>  advances.  It  is,  perhaps,  unreasonable  to</span><span>  expect  much  good  from  the  dyke  now  being</span><span>  built  until  it  reaches  thc  point  immediately</span></p> <p><span>  below  the  Upper  Flats  whore  the  river  :</span><span>  narrows  to  its  average  width  ;  but  when  that  is</span><span>  done,  the  effect  will  doubtless  quickly  become</span><span>  apparent.  This,  at  least,  is  Captain  Hunter's</span><span>  opinion,  who  hos  recently  inspected  the  works</span><span>  at  the  Upper  Flats,  and  watched  thc  course  of</span><span>  the  currents  in  that  locality.  He  says  that  the</span><span>  flood  tido  flows  up  thc  river  on  the</span><span>  outer  side  of  the  intended  channel</span><span>  and  pours  over  tho  dyke  ;  but  this  will</span><span>  not  be  tho  case  when  tho  dyke  has  been</span><span>  continued  to  the  point  named,  and  thc  ebb</span></p> <p><span>  and  flow  will  then  bo  confined  within  its</span></p> <p><span>  proper  limits,  thus  giving  greater  rapidity  to</span><span>  thc  current  with  an  increased  scour,  by  which</span><span>  the  formation  of  sandbanks,  will  effectually</span><span>  bs  prevented.  ,  /  f</span><span>  ""^rvQtJR  Gladstone  correspondent  informs  hs</span></p> <p><span>  that  the  petition  for  the  stoppage  of  all</span><span>  further  expenditure  in  improving  the  Fitzroy,</span><span>  and  for  the  continuation  of  the  Central  Rail-</span><span>  way  to  Gladstone,  has  been  forwarded  to  Mr.</span><span>  Palmer,  the  member  for  Port  Curtis,  for  pre-</span><span>  sentation.  It  must  be'sligbtly  discouraging,</span><span>  however,  to  the  petitioners,  to  observe  that</span><span>  despite  their  prodigious  efforts  to  enlighten</span><span>  the  Legislative  Assembly  on  the  question  of</span><span>  Rail  v.  Water  Carriage,  that  august</span><span>  body  quietly  ignores  tboir  expostulations,  and</span><span>  has  just  voted,  without  hesitation,  an  addi-</span><span>  tional  Bum  of  £40,000  additional  for  improv-</span><span>  ing  the  navigation  of  the  Fitzroy.  The  House,</span><span>  indeed,  having  voted  large  sums  for  the</span><span>  improvement  of  thc  river,  is  not  going  to</span><span>  stultify  itself  by  stopping  short  in  the  middle</span><span>  of  the  job,  and  Mr.  Nisbet  will  have  full  play  to</span><span>  carry  out  Ms  scheme  and  prove  its  immense</span><span>  advantage  to  the  trade  of  Central  Queensland.</span><span>  The  petition  will  doubtless  be  presented,</span><span>  received,  and  printed,  and  there  will  be  thc</span><span>  end  of  it.  By  the  way,  we  learn  from  a</span><span>  perusal  of  Hawmrd,  that  the  unsigned</span><span>  petition  (?)  presented  last  week  by  Mr.  Foote,</span><span>  and  received  by  the  House  on  the  assumption</span><span>  that  it  was  genuine,  requires  no  action  to  bc</span><span>  taken  upon  it,  os  the  Speaker  ruled  that  the</span><span>  ""petition""  not  hoing  a  petition  (as  it  had  no</span><span>  signatures),  the  order  for  its  reception  fell</span><span>  through  and  need  not  be  recorded.  Whilst</span></p> <p><span>  the  matter  was  before  the  House,  Mr.</span><span>  Palmer  said  it  was  the  merest  farce</span></p> <p><span>  to  present  a  petition  which  he  (Mr.  Palmer)</span><span>  knew  could  not  be  signed,  for  he  received  a</span><span>  copy  of  it  himself  by  last  mail  with  a  letter</span><span>  from  the  Progress  Committee,  askinghim,  when</span><span>  it  was  signed,  to  present  it.  A  member  inter-</span><span>  fering  with  tho  constituency  of  another</span><span>  member,  and  presenting  a  bunkum  petition,</span><span>  was  at  least  bound  to  tell  how  he  came  by  ifs</span><span>  To  him  (Mr.  P.)  it  looked  very  much  like</span><span>  stealing.  This  plain  speaking  brought  Mr.</span><span>  Foote  to  his  feet.  Thc  matter,  be</span><span>  said,  was  very  easily  explained.  Thc  peti-</span><span>  tion  was  sont  to  liim,  and  he  was</span><span>  asked  to  present  it.  On  receiving  it,  he  ran</span><span>  through  it  hurriedly,  so  that  he  might  pre-</span><span>  ssent  it  before  the  Orders  of  the  Day  were</span><span>  called  ;  and  bc  did  not  observe  that  it  was  not</span><span>  signed,  which  no  doubt  he  would  have  done  if</span><span>  he  had  boen  more  deliberate.  He  did  not  see</span><span>  that  there  was  any  stealing  in  the  matter.</span><span>  The  petition  had  been  forwarded  to  him</span><span>  through  the  post,  and  he  found  it  lying  in  his</span><span>  boxin  the  House,  andmerely  glancing  overit  in  a</span><span>  cursory  way,  he  did  not  notice  that  it  was  not</span><span>  sigucd.  He  further  stated  that  in  not  cou</span><span>  sulting  the  member  for  tho  district,  or  even</span><span>  mentioning  it,  he  intended  no  discourtesy  to</span><span>  liim.  Mr.  Foote's  explanation  failed,  of</span><span>  course,  lo  exonerate  him  from  blame,  and  only</span><span>  made  him  appear  more  ridiculous.</span></p> <p><span>  Tun  monthly  meeting  of  the  Committee  of</span><span>  thc  Benevolent  Society  was  held  yesterday</span><span>  afternoon,  at  half-post  four,  in  the  School  of</span><span>  Arts.

With</span><span>  reference  to  the  case  of  Kate  Duggan,  afflicted</span><span>  with  incurable  hysteria,  and  referred  to  at  the</span><span>  previous  meeting,  M  rs.  Salmond  stated  that  the</span><span>  patient  had  becu  sent  to  Sydney  to  her</span><span>  friends,  who  were  anxious  to  receive  her.  On</span><span>  the  motion  of  the  Rev.  A.

The  Lady  Pre-</span><span>  sident  brought  under  thc  notice  of  thc  Com-</span><span>  mittee  thc  high  price  paid  for  bread  ;  5d.  a</span><span>  loaf  soo  considered  was  too  much,  especially</span><span>  as  the  Hospital  was  supplied  for  3d.  This</span><span>  seemed  to  be  thc  general  opinion  of  the  Com-</span><span>  mittee,  but  as  thc  baker,  when  spoken  to  on</span><span>  the  matter,  liad  seilt  a  somewhat  liberal  dona-</span><span>  tion  to  the  Society,  no  further  steps  were</span><span>  taken.  Thc  Lady  President  submitted  a  draft</span><span>  report  to  be  laid  before  thc  annual  meeting  on</span><span>  the  2"")th  September.  Thc  report  was  read  and</span><span>  substantially  approved  of,  the  Lady  President</span><span>  stating  that  the  necessary  statistical  informa-</span><span>  tion  would  be  inserted  when  the  report  was</span><span>  formally  drawn  up.  Mrs.  Salmond  wislieii  it</span><span>  known  that  it  would  be  necessary  for  those</span><span>  who  were  canvassing  for  subscriptions  to  send</span><span>  in  the  names,  with  thc  amounts,  before  thc</span><span>  15th  instant,  in  order  to  facilitate  a  clear</span><span>  arrangement  of  business  for  the  annual</span><span>  meeting.  She  was  happy  to  say  that  sub-</span><span>  scriptions  wore  coining  in  in  a  very  satisfactory</span><span>  manner,  and  Bbc  might  state  that  she  had</span><span>  received  a  letter  from  the  Colonial  Secretary,</span><span>  informing  her  that  £200  was  placed  to  the</span><span>  credit  of  the  Society,  tlÚB  amount  being  the</span><span>  first  moiety  for  the  year  beginning  1st  July.</span><span>  The  Lady  President  referred  to  an  article</span><span>  which  appeared  in  the  local  Press,  the  tenor</span><span>  of  which  was  exceedingly  fair  and  compli.</span><span>  mcntary  to  the  Society;  but  an  error  had</span><span>  crept  in,  evidently  inadvertently,  with</span><span>  rcfcrcucc  to  the  meetings  having  been  fre-</span><span>  quently  postponed  of  late,  the  fact  being  that</span><span>  the  meeting  which  was  postponed  a  short  time</span><span>  ago  was  only  thc  second  which  had  lapsed</span><span>  during  the  whole  period  of  the  existence  of  the</span><span>  Society,  embracing  a  period  of  twelve  years.</span><span>  Thc  Rev.  lt.

When  there</span><span>  is  an  unfavourable  market,  reduced  rates</span><span>  are  not  a  very  great  temptation  to  the</span><span>  investor,  while  they  tend  to  injure  the</span><span>  credit  of  the  colony  adopting  such  an</span><span>  expedient  of  replenishing  its  Treasury.</span><span>  Hence  it  is,  we  presume,  that  the  New</span><span>  South  Wales  loan  has  been  withdrawn,</span><span>  and  that  the  associated  banks  in  Mel-</span><span>  bourne  have  been  advised  that  it  is</span></p> <p><span>  extremely  inadvisable  for  Victoria  to</span><span>  apply  even  for  a  small  loan  at  present.</span><span>  Possibly  the  money  market  will  have</span><span>  recovered  in  three  or  six  months  hence,</span><span>  in  which  casetheQueenslandGovernment</span><span>  will  suffer  no  inconvenience  ;  but  if  dear</span><span>  money  should  become  chronic,  we  shall</span></p> <p><span>  have  no  resource  but  to  slacken  the  ex-</span></p> <p><span>  penditure  upon  public  works,  and  adopt</span><span>  ibr  the  timebeing  a  policy  of  rest  and</span><span>  caution.  We  may  still  hope  that  the</span><span>  necessity  will  not  really  arise,  however.</span><span>  The  settlement  of  the  Eastern  question</span><span>  would  have  inevitablyderangedthemoney</span><span>  market  in  any  case  ;  but  the  acquirement</span><span>  of  Cyprus,  with  the  protectorate  over</span><span>  Asia  Minor,  has  opened  so  many  new</span><span>  avenues  for  British  money  that  it  is  not</span><span>  I  surprising  if  capitalists  prefer  to  husband</span></p> <p><span>  their  profits.  The  speculators  on  the</span><span>  Stock  Exchange  find  there  is  something</span><span>  to  be  got  out  of  ""  Turks  ""  and  ""  Egyp-</span><span>  tians  ""  after  all,  and  these  bonds  have</span><span>  been  obtainable  so  cheap,  and  bear  so</span><span>  high  a  rate  of  interest,  that  when  strength-</span><span>  ened  by  a  tacit  guarantee  from  the</span><span>  British  Government  it  is  not  surprising</span><span>  that  they  have  become  a  favourite  invest-</span><span>  ment  at  a  price.  It  is  but  natural  that</span><span>  Australian  four  per  cents  at  93  should</span><span>  form  no  temptation  when  Turkish  sixes</span><span>  are  procurable  at  one-third  or  one-half</span></p> <p><span>  that  rate.</span></p> <p><span>  There  are  indications,  however,  that</span><span>  the  proposed  new  Australian  loans  have</span><span>  somewhat  affected  the  money  market.</span><span>  Just  after  the  date  of  the  Berlin  treaty,</span></p> <p><span>  the  news  was  flashed  home  that  Victoria</span><span>  intended  to  authorise  a  new  loan  of</span><span>  nine  millions  ;  and  New  South  Wales,</span><span>  South  Australia,  and  Queensland  each</span><span>  one  of  three  millions,  making  a  total  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  four  colonies  of  eighteen  millions</span><span>  sterling.  It  is  not  surprising,  in  such</span><span>  circumstances,  that  the  Stock  Exchange</span><span>  hears  have  set  to  work  and  possibly</span><span>  created  a  small  panic.  A  new  loan</span><span>  always  affords  an  opportunity  for  de-</span><span>  pressing  the  price  of  existing  stocks,  if</span><span>  only  that  speculators  may  turn  an  honest</span><span>  penny  by  the  new  issue.  It  will  have</span></p> <p><span>  been  observed  that  whenever  a  new  loan</span></p> <p><span>  is  placed,  the  market  price  of  debentures</span><span>  immediately  advances  by  one  or  two</span><span>  per  cent.  This  represents  the  profit</span><span>  which  speculators  make  upon  the  transac-</span><span>  tion,  and  it  is  hopeless  to  attempt  to</span><span>  deprive  those  keen-witted  gentry  of  their</span><span>  legitimate  prey.  They  subsist  upon  the</span><span>  profits  of  bulling  and  bearing,  and  they</span><span>  must  be  treated  as  a  necessary  evil  of</span><span>  our  financial  systems.</span></p> <p><span>  The  fall  that  has  occurred  in  Austra-</span><span>  lian  debentures  is  very  serious,  and  it</span><span>  would  appear  that  Queensland  has  not</span><span>  suffered  more  than  other  colonies,</span><span>  although  her  securities  are  quoted  at  the</span><span>  lowest  rate.  The  following  table  shows</span><span>  the  respective  quotations  on  7th  June</span><span>  and  7  th  September  :</span></p> <p><span>  June  7'  Rcpt  7.</span><span>  New  South  Wales  ...  10*  97</span></p> <p><span>  Victorian  .  99  93J</span><span>  South  Australian  ...  9GJ  93</span><span>  Queensland  .  93  90</span></p> <p><span>  From  this  it  will  be  perceived  that</span><span>  the  stock  of  the  two  leading  colonies  has</span><span>  suffered  most  severely.  New  South  Wales</span><span>  having  dropped  7  per  cent,  Victorian</span><span>  5J4  per  cent,  and  South  Australian  3J¿,</span><span>  and  Queensland  3  per  cent.  Why  the</span><span>  parent  colony  should  have  been  made  the</span><span>  shocking  example  of  does  not  clearly</span><span>  appear,  unless  the  pressure  is  more  severe</span><span>  on  premium  securities  than  on  those</span><span>  already  at  a  discount.  But,  as  a  matter</span><span>  of  fact,  the  condition  of  New  South</span><span>  Wales  is  not  particularly  encouraging  in</span><span>  the  eyes  of  the  home  financier,  who</span><span>  naturally  thinks  there  must  be  something</span><span>  rotten  when  the  Treasury  books  a  surplus</span><span>  of  three  millions  and  yet  is  obliged  to</span><span>  borrow  one-half  that  amount  to  keep  the</span><span>  public  works  in  progress.  At  home  they</span><span>  do  not  appreciate  the  fiscal  jugglery  by</span></p> <p><span>  which  the  Government  sold  three</span><span>  millions  worth  of  land  at  £t  per  acre,</span><span>  and  yet  received  no  cash  in  payment  for</span></p> <p><span>  such  land.  The  banks'  customers  were</span></p> <p><span>  the  buyers,  but  the  banks  themselves</span></p> <p><span>  became  liable  to  the  Government  for</span></p> <p><span>  payment  ;  and  when  the  money  was</span><span>  needed  for  carrying  out  authorised  public</span><span>  works  it  was  unavailable,  having  got  into</span><span>  the  hands  of  the  banks'  customers  and</span></p> <p><span>  been  by  them  invested  in  various</span><span>  enterprises.  It  is  true  that  the  banks</span><span>  are  perfectly  well  able  to  pay,  but</span><span>  they  admit  that  they  could  only  do</span><span>  so  by  inconveniencing  their  customers.</span><span>  What  inconvenience  means  in  such  a</span><span>  case  every  business  man  too  well  knows,</span><span>  and  it  is  not  surprising  that  in  Great</span><span>  Britain,  where  such  a  phenomenon  would</span><span>  be  impossible,  the  existence  of  an</span><span>  unavailable  surplus  should  be  deemed</span></p> <p><span>  anomalous.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  fortunate  for  Queensland  thal</span><span>  her  Treasurer  need  not  place  the  new</span><span>  loan  just  now.  Hut  had  the  period  of</span><span>  dear  money  set  in  three  or  four  months</span><span>  ago,  instead  of  last  week,  the  position</span><span>  would  have  been  serious  indeed.  Thc</span><span>  public  works  must  have  come  to  an</span><span>  almost  sudden  stop,  and  what  that</span></p> <p><span>  means  most  readers  will  understand.</span><span>  Every  sixpence  in  hand  on  Northern</span><span>  Railway  construction  account,  for  ex-</span><span>  ample,  would  have  been  spent  before</span><span>  the  30th  June,  and  lhere  must  have</span><span>  been  an  abrupt  suspension.  And  even</span><span>  now  there  is  not  money  enough  in  hand</span><span>  for  twelve  months'  work  Unless  the</span><span>  new  loan  can  be  placed  before  May,</span></p> <p><span>  we  shall  see  the  staff  of  work-</span></p> <p><span>  men  rapidly  lessened,  and  preparations</span><span>  made  for  their  entire  disbandment.</span></p> <p><span>  The  prospect  is  not  encouraging.  For</span></p> <p><span>  this  state  of  affairs  we  have  to  thank  the</span></p> <p><span>  Railway  Reserves  scheme,  for  when  in</span><span>  1877  our  then  member  pointed  out  thal</span><span>  the  money  for  Northern  Railway  con-</span><span>  struction  would  ran  short,  he  was  silenced</span><span>  by  the  assurance  that  the  Central  Railway</span><span>  Reserve  would  furnish  amplemeans.  Had</span><span>  the  Government  done  their  duty  they</span><span>  could  have  placed  .£250,000  on  last</span><span>  year's  loan  estimates  for  our  line  instead</span><span>  of  a  miserable  ,£100,000,  which  is  only</span><span>  equivalent  to  eight  or  nine  months'  ex-</span><span>  penditure.  The  loan,  with  £""200,000  to</span><span>  .£300,000  additional,  would  have  been</span><span>  floated  without  difficulty  in  May  last,  and</span><span>  if  all  the  money  was  not  at  once  needed</span><span>  for  our  railway,  it  could  have  been  tem</span><span>  poiarily  re-appropriated.  But  it  was</span><span>  needed,  and  the  Treasurer  was  warned</span><span>  to  no  purpose  of  the  unjustifiable  risk  he</span><span>  was  running.  We  also  warned  the</span><span>  Government  repeatedly  through  these</span></p> <p><span>  columns,  but  with  the  effect  that  we  were</span></p> <p><span>  charged  with  unreasoning  hostility  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  best  Government  that  had  ever  existed  for</span><span>  theCentraldistiicts.  They  havenoivmade</span><span>  moderate  provision,  it  is  true,  but  if  New</span><span>  South  Wales  and  Victorian  securities  are</span><span>  not  negotiable,  is  it  likely  that  Queens-</span><span>  land  stock  will  be  received  with  favour  ?</span></p> <p><span>  And  it  is  impossible  to  predict  when  the</span><span>  home  money  market  will  resume  its  nor-</span><span>  mal  state.  It  is  pretty  certain  that  the</span><span>  time  for  cheap  money  has  passed,  and</span><span>  that  possibly  for  years  Australian  securities</span><span>  are^destined  to  be  saleable  at  prices</span><span>  which  represent  a  comparatively  high</span></p> <p><span>  rate  of  interest.</span></p> <p><span>  However,  we  have  no  desire  to  meet</span><span>  trouble  half-way.  If  the  worst  should</span><span>  happen  the  colony  will  pass  through  a</span><span>  period  of  severe  trial,  but  there  need  be</span><span>  no  doubt  of  ultimate  recovery.  But  it  is</span><span>  impossible  not  to  envy  the  prudence  of</span><span>  New  Zealand  statesmen,  who  boldly</span><span>  faced  the  responsibility  of  borrowing  at</span><span>  one  operation  a  sufficient  amount  to</span><span>  cover  three  or  four  years'  prospective</span><span>  loan  expenditure.  Had  our  Govern-</span><span>  ment  followed  the  same  plan  instead  of</span><span>  taking  a  leap  in  the  dark  by  adopting</span><span>  the  Railway  Reserves  system,  we  should</span><span>  now  be  free  from  anxiety,  and  our  public</span><span>  works  might  be  carried  on  withunrelaxed</span><span>  vigour.  As  it  is,  the  Treasurer  will  be</span><span>  bound  to  keep  a  close  watch  upon  ex-</span><span>  penditure,  and  if  no  more  favourable</span><span>  aspect  is  assumed  by  the  money  market</span><span>  by  the  beginning  of  next  year,  he  will  be</span><span>  bound  to  slack  .  off  wherever  possible.</span><span>  Our  available  railway  money  ought  to  be</span><span>  all  gone  by  the  end  of  the  current  year,</span><span>  for  the  Treasurer  is  short  by  .£50,000  of</span><span>  the  amount  requisite  lo  complete  the  line</span><span>  to  Emerald  Downs  ;  and  most  readers</span><span>  know  that  it  ought  to  bc  finished  to  that</span><span>  point  not  long  after  the  ist  January.</span></p> <p><span>  Whether  the  Treasurer  will  be  able  to</span></p> <p><span>  carry  on  our  line  temporarily  by  operating</span><span>  upon  that  portion  of  his  loan  balance</span><span>  which  lies  to  the  credit  of  other  public</span><span>  works  remains  to  be  seen,  but  to  do  so</span><span>  would  set  a  precedent  which  might  some</span><span>  day  be  turned  against  us.  In  former</span><span>  times  we  saw  money  for  the  Central</span><span>  district  voted  every  year  but  not  spent  ;</span><span>  and  there  is  no  security,  if  the  principle</span><span>  of  transfer  be  once  admitted  in  regard  to</span><span>  loan  balances,  that  any  district  will</span><span>  actually  receive  the  money  voted  by</span></p> <p><span>  Parliament  for  its  benefit.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Customs  collections  at  this  port  from</span><span>  thc  9th  to  thc  14th  instant  inclusive  amounted</span><span>  to  £1755  14s.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  boat  races  arranged  by  the  Fitzroy</span><span>  Bowing  Club  came  off  on  Saturday  afternoon,</span><span>  and,  as  usual,  attracted  a  number  of  sjiectators,</span><span>  amongst  whom  the  fair  sex  were  predominant.</span><span>  The  gig  race,  between  thc  Hanking  and  Com-</span><span>  mercial  crews,  was  the  opening  os  well  as</span><span>  principal  event.  Owing  to  a  slight  indisposi-</span><span>  tion  of  one  of  the  Commercial  crew,  the  BankB</span><span>  were  favourites  at  C  to  4.  Mr.  T.  S.  Hall</span><span>  started  the  boats  from  Crocodile  Creek,  the</span><span>  course  being  about  a  mile  and  a-half  in  length.</span><span>  They  got  away  on  very  even  terms,  tho</span><span>  Bankers  hugging  thc  north  side  to  avoid  the</span><span>  run  of  the  tide,  whilst  the  Mercantile  took  thc</span><span>  middle  of  thc  stream,  evidently  satisfied  with</span><span>  their  staying  powers.  Tho  financial  crew  soon</span><span>  led  at  a  smart  pace,  and  continued  to  improve</span><span>  their  advantage  to  the  A.  S.  N.  Company's</span><span>  wharves,  which  they  passed  a  length  and</span><span>  a-half  to  the  good.  Herc  the  Mercantile  crew</span><span>  commenced  to  draw  nu  their  opponents,  and,</span><span>  making  it  very  wann  to  the  foot  of  William</span><span>  street,  had  dccreascil  the  gap  by  a  length.</span><span>  From  thence  the  spectators  were  treated  to  au</span><span>  exhibition  of  one  of  thc  best  finishes  ever  made</span><span>  on  tho  river.  On  nearing  the  Scottish  Knight</span><span>  the  Mercantile*  got  level  with  the  leading  boat,</span><span>  and,  amidst  moBt  intense  excitement,  landed</span><span>  thc  honours  hy  about  titree  feet.  In  thc  next</span><span>  race,  Barns  and  F.  Bundy  met  F.  Boldcman  and</span><span>  Potts.  A  start  was  made  from  near  thc  1'owdcr</span></p> <p><span>  Magazine,  thc  contestants  being  on  level  terms</span><span>  until  nearing  thc  Scottish  Knight,  when</span><span>  Barns,  greatly  assisted  by  his  partner,</span><span>  freshened  up,  and,  despite  their  opponents1</span><span>  final  spurt,  won  rather  comfortably  hy  a  length</span></p> <p><span>  and  half.  A  match  between  Eliott  and  John</span></p> <p><span>  Craig  followed,  and  needs  very  little  descrip-</span><span>  tion,  as  Craig,  making  an  ciTatic  course  to  thc</span><span>  north  hank,  allowed  his  opponent  to  pull  over</span></p> <p><span>  thc  distance  at  his  leisure.  Thc  scratch  fours</span></p> <p><span>  brought  out  three  crews  ;  thc  lot  stroked  by</span><span>  Ixigan  gaining  many  friends  as  they  paddled</span><span>  down  the  stream.  On  occupying  their</span><span>  stations  the  favourites  had  the  centre</span><span>  position,  Julius'  crew  ljcing  on  tho  north</span><span>  side,  and  Hams'  on  the  south.  Mr.  Hall</span><span>  despatched  the  loton  their  journey  from  below</span><span>  thc  Magazine,  and  for  about  500  yards  there</span><span>  was  nothing  to  choose  between  thom.  On</span><span>  nearing  thc  Company's  wharves  Logan'B  crew</span><span>  had  obtained  n  lead  of  a  length,  which  they</span><span>  continued  to  increase  evny  stroke.  Towards</span><span>  thc  end  of  thu  racu  Barns'  crew,  encouraged</span><span>  by  their  friends  tm  thc  hank,  made  a  de-</span><span>  termined  effort,  but  failed  to  reach  the  leading</span></p> <p><span>  j  boat,  which  won  easily  hy  a  length  and  a-half  ;</span></p> <p><span>  the  crew  stroked  by  Julius  being  three</span><span>  lengths  behind  the  Rocond.

Accord-</span><span>  ing  to  our  correspondent's  communication  in</span><span>  185!»,  when  he  first  took  up  residence  at</span><span>  Adeloug,  the  burr  was  not  to  be  seen  on  any</span><span>  of  thc  nats-in  fact  was  unknown.  It  was</span><span>  not  until  1SG1  that  it  made  its  appearance,</span><span>  and,  as  usual,  soon  overcame  the  pastures.</span><span>  After  the  burr  had  firm  hold  some  residents  of</span><span>  the  town  introduced  goats,  and  these  animals</span><span>  evinced  a  great  taste  for  burrs.  As  the  goats</span><span>  increased  the  burrs  disappeared,  and  now  tho</span><span>  goats  arc  complete  masters  of  the  situation.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  now  scarcely  a  burr  on  the  bills  of</span></p> <p><span>  Adelong,  and  very  few  alive  on  the  fiats.</span><span>  Thc  only  drawback  to  this  new  eradicator  is</span><span>  that  thc  goats  may  he  considered  greater</span><span>  nuisances  than  thc  burrs.

Dr.  Bancroft  lias  brought  a  large</span><span>  collection  of  seeds  of  plants  that  seem  suitable</span><span>  for  this  colony.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin,  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  JANUARY  9,  1878.</span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span>  THE  violence  of  party  conflict  in  Vic-</span></p> <p><span>  toria  threatens  to  prove  calamitous  to</span><span>  that  colony.  The  deadlock  may  be</span></p> <p><span>  terminated  when  the  adjournment  ends</span><span>  next  month,  but  present  appearances</span><span>  indicate  that  it  will  be  fought  out  to  the</span><span>  bitter  end.  From  the  Conservative</span><span>  journals  in  Victoria,  and  from  the  Press</span><span>  universally  beyond  the  boundaries  of</span><span>  that  colony,  Mr.  Berry  gets  sole  credit</span><span>  for  the  deadlock  and  all  the</span></p> <p><span>  rancour  evoked  by  the  contest.</span><span>  Mr.  Berry  is  certainly  the  most</span><span>  prominent  figure  on  the  aggressive  side,</span><span>  but  he  is  backed  up  by  many  thousands</span><span>  of  colonists  who  cannot  be  fairly</span><span>  classed  among  the  unthinking  mob.</span><span>  There  is  something  to  be  said  on  his</span><span>  side  of  the  question,  and  the  journals</span><span>  who  violently  oppose  and  denounce  him</span></p> <p><span>  are  doing  more  than  anything  else  to</span><span>  keep  his  party  together.  Nothing  is</span></p> <p><span>  gained  for  truth  and  justice  by  ignoring</span><span>  or  misrepresenting  facts,  and  by  mud-</span><span>  throwing.  This  kind  of  warfare  is  car-</span><span>  ried  on  by  the  disputants  on  both  sides,</span></p> <p><span>  but  from  the  ""ignorant  and  prejudiced</span><span>  Berry  faction  ""  nothing  else  could  be</span></p> <p><span>  expected.  From  the  organs  of</span><span>  the  wealthy  and  cultivated  classes,  how-</span><span>  ever,  better  things  were  expected,  and</span><span>  are,  in  fact,  demanded.  The  battle</span><span>  being  fought  in  Victoria  is  one  in  which</span><span>  all  the  other  colonies  have  a  deep  ;</span><span>  though  indirect  interest  ;  and  the  lovers</span><span>  of  order  and  good  govenment  through-</span></p> <p><span>  out  Australia  have  the  right  to  demand</span><span>  that  the  battle  on  their  side,  at  least,</span></p> <p><span>  shall  be  conducted  pursuant  to  the  rules</span></p> <p><span>  of  honourable  warfare.  That  this  is  not</span><span>  being  done  by  the  ""  Constitutionalists  ""</span><span>  in  Victoria  is  but  too  apparent</span><span>  from  the  rancorous  articles  which</span><span>  fill,  the  leading  columns  of  their</span><span>  representative  journals—articles  which</span><span>  we  regret  to  say  are  finding  their  echoes</span><span>  in  that  portion  of  the  Queensland  Press</span><span>  which  in  dealing  with  local  politicians</span><span>  sometimes  betrays  ""over-conscientious</span><span>  sensitiveness.""</span></p> <p><span>  That  our  remarks  upon  the  bitter</span><span>  writing  of  Victorian  journalists  are  justi-</span><span>  fied,  is  shown  some  passages  from  recent</span><span>  numbers  of  that  otherwise  estimable</span><span>  paper,  the  Australasian.  Speaking  of</span><span>  Mr.  Berry's  attitude  on  the  payment  of</span><span>  members  question,  our  Melbourne  con-</span><span>  temporary  calls  the  majority  a  ""compact</span><span>  cohort  of  stipendiaries  ;""  declares</span></p> <p><span>  that  they  are  actuated  by  ""open,</span><span>  unblushing,  unconcealed  greed  of</span></p> <p><span>  'public  pence  ;'  ""  that,  ""misrepresent</span></p> <p><span>  the  position  of  affairs  as  Mr.  Berry  may,</span><span>  there  is  no  possibility  of  exculpating  his</span><span>  supporters  from  the  imputation  of  being</span><span>  actuated  by  sordid  and  mercenary  mo-</span><span>  tives  ;""  and  that  ""  to  talk  of  the  rights  of</span><span>  the  general  community  being  assailed  is</span></p> <p><span>  about  as  rational  as  it  would  have  been</span></p> <p><span>  for  Claude  Duval  to  have  remonstrated</span><span>  with  the  mounted  patrol  for  infringing</span><span>  the  liberties  of  the  subject  by  putting  a</span><span>  stop  to  his  depredations.""

This  is  a  fine  specimen  of</span><span>  smart  writing,  but  its  effect  must  cer-</span><span>  tainly  be  to  consolidate  rather  than</span><span>  break  up  the  opposing  phalanx.</span></p> <p><span>  The  same  journal  contains  an  article</span></p> <p><span>  entitled,  ""The  question  stated,""  pur-</span><span>  porting  to  represent  the  precise  origin  of</span><span>  the  dispute  and  the  objects  sought  to  be</span><span>  attained  on  each  side.  The  issue  is</span></p> <p><span>  declared  to  be  ""  whether  a  chamber  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  Legislature,  which  was  believed  to</span><span>  be  hostile  to  the  determination  of  the</span><span>  hungry  crew  behind  Mr.  Berry  to  dip</span><span>  their  hands  in  the  public  chest  by  voting</span></p> <p><span>  themselves  salaries,  shall  be  swept  away</span><span>  or  rendered  impotent  in  future  for  the  pre-</span></p> <p><span>  vention  of  such  shameful  abuses.  This</span><span>  statement  of  the  case  is  not  only  correct,</span><span>  but  it  is  complete.""  But  here  the  Aus-</span><span>  tralasian  is  clearly  wrong.  It  is  plain</span><span>  that  the  Legislative  Council  by  dexterous</span><span>  manipulation  have  diverted  the</span><span>  issue  from  payment  of  members</span></p> <p><span>  to  a  constitutional  question.  They  re-</span><span>  fused  to  consider  the  Payment  of  Mem-</span><span>  bers  Bill  on  its  merits,  because  the</span><span>  amount  to  be  appropriated  under  it  was</span></p> <p><span>  not  withdrawn  from  the  Estimates.  The</span></p> <p><span>  retention  of  the  item,  while  the  bill</span><span>  was  under  consideration  in  the  Council,</span><span>  they  averred  to  be  ""coercion.""  So  they</span><span>  ""laid  aside""  the  Payment  of  Members</span><span>  Bill,  and  afterwards  when  the  Appropri-</span><span>  ation  Bill  came  up  providing  an  amount</span></p> <p><span>  for  payment  of  members,  they  laid  that</span></p> <p><span>  aside  too.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  no  wish  to  justify</span><span>  the  bombastic  speeches  or  the  policy</span><span>  of  Mr.  Berry  ;  for  he  has  shown</span><span>  himself  entirely  destitute  of  the  self-</span><span>  control,  breadth  of  view,  and  diplomatic</span></p> <p><span>  tact  requisite  in  a  leading  politician.</span><span>  But  the  plea  of  ""coercion""  by  the</span><span>  Council  was  a  mere  pretext.  The  item</span><span>  for  payment  of  members  was  not  actually</span><span>  passed  when  the  bill  came  before  them.</span><span>  It  remained  on  the  Estimates,  truly,  but</span></p> <p><span>  the  very  fact  of  Ministers  sending  up  the</span><span>  bill  at  the  eleventh  hour  implied  that  if</span></p> <p><span>  the  bill  miscarried  the  item  it  was</span><span>  intended  to  legalise  would  be  struck  off.</span><span>  It  is  urged  that  Mr  Berry  had  no  such</span><span>  intention,  because  he  had  previously  de-</span><span>  clared  that  the  money  should  be  paid  in</span><span>  spite  of  the  Council.  But  the  intro-</span><span>  duction  of  the  bill  was  obviously</span><span>  a  retracing  of  his  steps,  and  had  the</span><span>  Council  considered  the  measure  on  its</span></p> <p><span>  merits,  there  is  no  knowing  how  much</span><span>  farther  the  Premier  would  have  gone  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  same  direction.  At  any  rate,  the</span><span>  Council  had  no  right  to  assume  by  antici-</span><span>  pation  that  he  would  not  accept  their</span><span>  decision  on  the  question.</span></p> <p><span>  The  truth  is,  however,  that  for  months</span><span>  past  coercion  has  been  practised  by  the</span><span>  ""  Constitutionalist  ""  journals  towards  the</span><span>  Berry  party.  When  the  Land  Tax  Bill</span><span>  was  before  Parliament  the  Council  were</span></p> <p><span>  advised  to  accept  it  under  protest  and</span><span>  fight  the  battle  with  the  hungry  crew  on</span><span>  the  Payment  of  Members  question.  For</span></p> <p><span>  months  past  that  question  as  a  matter  of</span><span>  public  policy  has  never  been  fairly</span><span>  argued.  It  has  never  been  pointed  out</span><span>  that  Mr.  Berry's  two-thirds  majority</span><span>  accepted  their  responsibilities  knowing</span><span>  that  the  law  during  the  past  session  of</span><span>  Parliament,  at  least  would  provide  them</span><span>  payment  for  their  services.  The  proba-</span><span>  bility  is  that  many  of  the  country  mem-</span><span>  bers,  being  local  men,  would  never  have</span><span>  entered  Parliament  but  for  the  know-</span><span>  ledge  that  their  expenses  would  be</span><span>  defrayed.  And  having  been  elected  for</span><span>  three  years,  and  finding  also  that  two-</span><span>  thirds  of  the  Assembly  were  in  favour  of</span></p> <p><span>  perpetuating  payment,  they  were</span><span>  naturally  indisposed  to  give  way  at  the</span><span>  bidding  of  abusive  journalists  or  purse</span><span>  proud  members  of  the  Upper  House.</span></p> <p><span>  We  are  not  in  favour  of  payment  of</span></p> <p><span>  members;  not  because  public  men  are  not</span><span>  entitled  to  compensation  for  their  parlia-</span><span>  mentary  expenses,  but  because  £300</span><span>  a-year  will  not  procure  the  services  of</span><span>  men  fit  for  public  life.  There  are  two</span><span>  classes  of  members  of  parliament—</span><span>  those  who  are  or  expect  to  become</span><span>  leaders,  and  those  whose  highest  ambi-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  is  to  follow  the  men  most  worthy  of</span><span>  their  confidence.  The  £300  a-year</span><span>  would  never  draw  or  retain  men  capable</span><span>  of  becoming  leading  politicians,  and</span><span>  those  who  follow  can  be  procured  from</span><span>  the  ranks  of  men  in  the  enjoyment</span><span>  of  a  competency.  But  £300  a-year</span><span>  is  an  irresistible  attraction  to  the  garru-</span><span>  lous  adventurer  who  is  nothing  if  not  a</span><span>  wind-bag.  The  public  welfare  demands</span><span>  that  persons  of  this  last  class  should  not  be</span></p> <p><span>  encouraged  to  get  into  Parliament,  as  they</span></p> <p><span>  have  neither  the  brains  to  initiate  desira-</span><span>  ble  reforms,  nor  the  property  ""  stay  ""  to</span><span>  preserve  them  from  agitating  for  reckless</span><span>  and  destructive  changes.  We  are  there-</span><span>  fore  entirely  with  the  constitutional</span><span>  party  in  Victoria  on  this  question  ;  and</span></p> <p><span>  we  thoroughly  endorse  their  advocacy  of</span><span>  free  trade.  But  we  fear  they  are  ruining</span><span>  a  good  cause  by  unjustifiable  asperity,</span><span>  and  by  assuming  that  their  opponents</span></p> <p><span>  are  all  fools  or  knaves.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  51st  monthly  meeting  of  the  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  Building  Society,  No.  5,  was  held</span><span>  last  night  at  the  offices  of  the  Secretary.</span><span>  £272  19s.  11d.  was  received  as  subscriptions</span><span>  and  interest.

In  con-</span><span>  sequence  of  the  wind  being  rather  strong,  it</span></p> <p><span>  was  deemed  advisable  for  him  not  to  carry  his</span></p> <p><span>  sister  across  the  rope,  a  feat  which  he  intends</span><span>  to  perform  to-night,  weather  permitting.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  learn  that  in  the  case  of  the  Australian</span><span>  Joint  Stock  Bank  v.

Mrs.</span></p> <p><span>  George  Williams,  admitted  November  13th  on</span><span>  an  interim  order  from  the  Visiting  Justice  ;</span><span>  Henry  Westmann,  admitted  November  28th,</span><span>  on  an  interim  order  from  the  medical  officer—</span><span>  re-committed  for  one  month  each.  Margaret</span><span>  McLennan,  admitted  on  1st  instant  from  the</span></p> <p><span>  Gaol  on  an  order  from  the  Sheriff—committed</span></p> <p><span>  to  the  Reception  House,  Brisbane,  for  trans-</span></p> <p><span>  mission  to  the  Woogaroo  Lunatic  Asylum.</span></p> <p><span>  Now  that  the  holidays  are  over,  the  diggers</span><span>  on  our  local  gold-fields  have  returned  to  their</span><span>  sinkings  with  renewed  spirit.  On  some  fields,</span><span>  however,  there  is  little  or  nothing  doing  ;  the</span><span>  best,  perhaps,  is  Rosewood,  where  there  are</span><span>  about  150  men  at  work,  all  on  gold.  We  have</span><span>  not  heard  of  any  great  finds  recently,  for  most</span><span>  of  the  diggers  observe  a  significant  reticence  as</span><span>  to  their  success  ;  but  it  may  be  taken  for</span><span>  granted  that  when  no  complaints  are  made</span><span>  there  is  something  ""in  the  wind.""  That  several</span><span>  have  made  more  than  ""tucker""  is  certain  ;</span><span>  and  we  hear  of  one  man  who  has  been  dig-</span><span>  ging  for  two  years,  sticking  to  his  post  while</span><span>  others  went  in  search  of  pastures  new,  and</span></p> <p><span>  who  has  now  £200  in  the  bank.  Others  are</span><span>  probably  in  a  like  position.  There  have  seldom</span><span>  been  more  than  from  60  to  80  diggers  at  Rose-</span><span>  wood  ;  and  frequently  the  number  has  been</span><span>  very  considerably  less.  The  field  has  therefore</span><span>  proved  unusually  attractive  of  late.</span></p> <p><span>  MR.  MILES'  besom  of—we  had  almost  said</span><span>  destruction—reform  is  sweeping  particularly</span><span>  clean  just  now  while  it  remains  new,  and  is</span><span>  is  creating  great  dissatisfaction  among  officers  of</span><span>  the  department  throughout  the  colony.  As</span><span>  one  ramification  of  the  crusade  against  the  free</span></p> <p><span>  pass  system,  we  find  that  the  railway  station</span><span>  masters  are  now  required  to  pay  parcel  rates</span></p> <p><span>  for  the  necessaries  of  life.  There  is,  for</span></p> <p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span></span></p> <p><span>  example,  a  station  master  located  in  some</span><span>  solitary  spot  on  the  line  where  there  is  no</span><span>  general  store,  butcher,  or  baker.  If  some  day</span><span>  his  wife's  yeast  goes  bad,  or  from  any  other  cause</span><span>  she  is  unable  to  bake  bread,  and  the  station</span><span>  master  gets  a  two-pound  loaf  up  by  train,  it</span><span>  costs  him  just  two  shillings  and  threepence,</span><span>  including  carriage.  His  butchers'  meat  also</span><span>  stands  him  in  famine  prices  ;  so  that,  with  his</span><span>  small  salary,  living  honestly  becomes  a  problem</span><span>  which  it  is  very  difficult  to  solve.  At  the</span><span>  same  time  he  is  annoyed  by  the  information</span><span>  that  all  oofficers  employed  on  ""  construction  ""</span><span>  get  their  stores  free  as  before,  the  new  regu-</span><span>  lation  applying  only  to  the  ""traffic""  and</span><span>  ""  maintenance  ""  officials.  There  is  a  very</span><span>  general  complaint,  two,  at  the  enforcement  of</span></p> <p><span>  these  economies  on  the  Northern  line  while</span><span>  the  late  Minister's  promise  to  ""level</span></p> <p><span>  up  ""  salaries  remains  unfulfilled.  It</span><span>  is  notorious  that,  as  compared  with</span><span>  the  salaries  on  the  Southern  line,  those  paid</span></p> <p><span>  on  the  Northern  one  are  disproportionately</span><span>  low,  and  the  ration  carriage  charges  just  im-</span><span>  posed  are  felt  under  these  circumstances  to  be</span></p> <p><span>  grossly  unjust.  We  hope  that  while  Mr.</span><span>  Miles  is  stopping  a  trifling  escape  at  the  spigot</span><span>  he  is  not  permitting  the  cask  to  run  itself</span><span>  rapidly  empty  at  the  bung.</span></p> <p><span>  DETECTIVE  LONG  has  removed  his  office</span></p> <p><span>  from  Denham-street  to  premises  in  East-street,</span><span>  opposite  Richmond  House,  where  for  the</span><span>  future  he  may  be  consulted  by  persons  requir-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  his  services.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  death  of  General  La  Marmora  is  an-</span></p> <p><span>  nouned  by  cablegram.  He  was  born  on  the</span><span>  18th  November,  1804,  and  in  the  course  of  a</span><span>  long  life  was  twice  Minister  of  War  at  Turin,</span><span>  and  in  later  years  was  at  the  head  of  an</span><span>  Italian  administration.  His  military  career  is</span><span>  worth  noting.  According  to  ""Men  of  the</span><span>  Time,""  and  other  biographical  works,  he</span><span>  entered  the  Military  Academy  in  1816,  and</span><span>  issued,  in  1823,  as  lieutenant  in  the  artillery.</span><span>  When  the  War  of  Independence  broke  out,</span><span>  he  held  the  rank  of  Major.  He  distinguished</span><span>  himself  in  several  affairs,  especially  on  the</span><span>  heights  of  Pastrengo,  when,  by  making  a</span></p> <p><span>  diversion  in  the  rear  of  the  Austrian  army,  he</span><span>  enabled  the  Piedmontese,  who  were  in  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  order,  to  re-form,  and  dislodge  the  enemy.  He</span><span>  rose  step  by  step,  until  he  got  to  the  top  of  the</span><span>  ladder.  He  rendered  important  services</span><span>  to  his  country  by  introducing  various  reforms</span><span>  into  the  Sardinian  army  ;  and  in  1855  he  took</span><span>  command  of  the  division  sent  to  co-operate</span><span>  with  France  and  England  in  the  Crimea,</span><span>  aiding  the  French  in  the  defeat  of  the  enemy</span><span>  on  the  Tchernaya.  He  received  various  de-</span><span>  corations,  and  in  1861  was  made  commander-</span></p> <p><span>  in-chief  of  the  troops.  He  has  died  full  of</span><span>  years  and  honours,  a  fitting  termination  to  a</span></p> <p><span>  life  spent  in  the  service  of  his  country.</span></p> <p><span>  OUR  local  Bench  was  called  upon  yesterday</span><span>  to  adjudicate  on  a  case  of  some  importance,  and</span><span>  we  mention  the  facts  in  order  that  the  un-</span><span>  wary  may  be  on  their  guard.  It  appears  that</span><span>  a  German,  while  travelling  by  railway,</span><span>  unwittingly  broke  the  regulations,  by  acting</span></p> <p><span>  as  a  private  carrier  .  Before  starting  at</span><span>  Blackwater,  he  obliged  a  storekeeper</span><span>  by  taking  charge  of  a  parcel  to  be</span><span>  delivered  at  Dingo,  beinig  unaware,  seemingly,</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  existence  of  the  following  Bye-law,  No.</span><span>  4,  which  provides,  ""  That  any  person  who</span><span>  shall  convey,  either  for  himself  or  any  other</span><span>  person  or  persons,  general  merchandise  or</span><span>  other  goods  not  being  his  or  their  personal</span><span>  luggage,  without  having  paid  the  proper  toll,</span><span>  or  with  intent  to  avoid  payment  thereof,  shall</span><span>  be  liable  to  a  penalty  not  exceeding  £10.""  It</span><span>  was  evident,  from  the  first,  that  there  was  no</span><span>  intention  on  the  part  of  the  defendant  to  de-</span><span>  fraud  the  department,  he  having  acted  in  pure</span><span>  ignorance  of  the  law  on  the  subject  ;  and  the</span><span>  Traffic  Manager,  who  prosecuted,  said  he  did</span><span>  not  wish  to  press  the  case,  as  he  had</span><span>  gained  his  object,  in  this  instance,  by</span><span>  the  publicity  given  to  the  matter.</span><span>  The  defendant  was  therefore  let  off  by  paying</span></p> <p><span>  the  expenses  incurred.  Of  course,  the  next</span></p> <p><span>  person  who  commits  a  breach  of  the  bye-law</span><span>  cannot  expect  to  fare  so  well,  as  he  will  not</span><span>  be  able  to  plead  ignorance  as  an  excuse  ;  and  it</span><span>  should  therefore  be  remembered  that  ordinary</span><span>  luggage  may  be  conveyed  free  by  passengers,</span><span>  but  not  goods,  or  anything  else,  in  fact,  on</span><span>  which  freight  is  payable.  If  people  were</span><span>  permitted  to  act  as  private  carriers,  railways</span><span>  would  soon  cease  to  exist,  as  they  would  be-</span><span>  come  a  heavy  burden  on  the  State.</span></p> <p><span>  LABOURERS  WANTED.—While  the  Trades</span><span>  Unionists  of  New  South  Wales  are  doing  all</span><span>  in  their  power  to  stop  immigration,  harvest</span><span>  operations  are  at  a  standstill  in  many  places</span><span>  for  want  of  hands.—  '  A  Farmer,'  writes  to</span><span>  the  Grenfell  Record  :—""Can  anything  be  done</span><span>  to  get  some  of  the  immigrants,  who  are  con-</span><span>  stantly  landing  in  Sydney,  to  come  as  far  as</span><span>  Grenfell?  Never  was  labour  so  hard  to  be</span><span>  got  as  at  present.  I  have  been  no  end  of</span><span>  times  to  Grenfell,  to  find  men  to  help  me  with</span><span>  my  harvest,  and  after  much  trouble  and</span><span>  treating,  have  hired  a  set  of  fellows  who  prove</span></p> <p><span>  to  be  only  good  at  eating  and  drinking.  What</span><span>  with  these  lazy  louts,  and  the  late  storm  and</span><span>  rain,  the  prospects  of  the  farmer  are  poor</span><span>  indeed.  What  is  wanted  is  a  set  of  agri-</span><span>  cultural  labourers  who  understand  their  work,</span><span>  or  a  few  really  good  machines—the  latter</span><span>  would  relieve  farmers  of  much  anxiety  and</span><span>  annoyance,  and  would  no  doubt  in  the  long</span><span>  run  prove  the  cheapest  and  best  means  of</span><span>  securing  their  crops.""</span></p> <p><span>  A  BALLOON  VOYAGE—A  Bombay  telegram</span><span>  says  :—Mr.  Lynn's  balloon  ascended  on</span><span>  Saturday,  at  3.20  p.  m.,  with  Mr.  Geary  and</span><span>  Mr.  Lynn,  but  the  lifting  power  was  only</span><span>  sufficient  to  take  up  400  lbs.  of  ballast  ;  it</span><span>  grazed  a  palm  tree  in  rising,  when  a  portion</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  ballast  had  to  be  thrown  out.  It</span></p> <p><span>  then  rose  4000  feet,  and  began  to  descend,</span><span>  compelling  the  waste  of  more  ballast.  It</span><span>  then  rose  to  10,000  feet,  hanging  motionless</span><span>  over  the  harbour  four  minutes,  and  then</span><span>  went  out  to  sea.  It  was  now  evident  some-</span></p> <p><span>  thing  was  wrong,  so  boats  put  off,  and  the</span><span>  balloon  descended  slowly.  The  last  ounce  of</span><span>  ballast  kept  it  up  ten  minutes  more.  It  then</span><span>  descended  with  increasing  speed,  struck  the</span><span>  water  one  mile  opposite  the  side  of  the</span><span>  harbour,  and  for  twenty  minutes  the  car  was</span><span>  dragged  through  the  water,  revolving  with</span><span>  the  balloon,  which  acted  as  a  sail.  Mr.  Lynn</span><span>  was  like  a  squirrel  in  a  cage.  Mr.  Geary  was</span><span>  outside  the  ropes,  and  both  were  perpetually</span><span>  on  the  move  to  preserve  a  balance,  and  were</span><span>  often  up  to  their  necks  in  the  water.  At  last</span><span>  a  native  boat  caught  their  grappling-iron  with</span><span>  an  anchor,  and  the  aeronauts  jumped  aboard.</span></p> <p><span>  The  balloon  carried  off  the  boat's  anchor  and</span></p> <p><span>  tackle,  and  shot  up  like  a  rocket  some</span><span>  30,000  feet.  Eventually  it  sank  between</span><span>  Pamwell  and  Twetheran,  where  the  same</span><span>  gentlemen  discovered  it  yesterday  not</span><span>  materially  hurt.  After  their  rescue  the</span><span>  aeronauts  were  taken  on  board  the  pilot</span><span>  schooner,  and  reached  Bombay  about  7,</span></p> <p><span>  where  the  greatest  excitement  and  anxiety</span><span>  prevailed.  Mr.  Lynn's  letter  pays  a  high</span><span>  compliment  to  Mr.  Geary's  pluck.</span></p> <p><span>  A  LAND  BLUNDER  —In  an  article  dealing</span><span>  with  the  comparative  agricultural  statistics  of</span><span>  the  several  colonies,  the  South  Australian</span><span>  Chronicle  concludes,  by  saying  :—""  It  is  sad  to</span></p> <p><span>  turn  to  a  colony  like  New  South  Wales  and</span><span>  see  the  contrast  it  presents  to  our  own.  With</span><span>  land  laws  that  are  intended  to  be  yet  more</span><span>  liberal  than  ours,  with  power  given  to  any</span><span>  would-be  farmer  to  scour  the  country  in  its</span><span>  length  and  breadth,  occupied  or  not  by  the</span><span>  pastoral  lessee,  and  pick  out  anywhere  his  640</span><span>  acres,  settlement  has  proceeded  so  slowly  that  it</span><span>  is  scarcely  overtaking  the  increase  of  population.</span><span>  The  adoption  of  free  selection  before  survey  as</span><span>  a  boon  to  the  people  has  resulted  in  making</span><span>  the  sqatters  owners  of  the  greater  proportion</span><span>  of  the  land  that  is  really  available  for  agricul-</span><span>  ture.  Possessed  of  an  intimate  knowledge  of</span><span>  the  land  on  their  respective  runs,  they  have</span><span>  purchased,  with  the  aid  of  the  banks  in  most</span><span>  cases,  just  the  choicest  bits,  especially  those</span><span>  having  command  of  the  water.  Not  only  have</span><span>  they  thus  secured  the  best  land,  but  they  have</span><span>  in  securing  it  prevented  the  occupation  of</span><span>  hundreds  of  thousands  of  acres  which,  under  a</span><span>  wise  system  of  water  frontages,  would  have</span><span>  been  available  for  cultivation.  Free  selection</span><span>  before  survey  has  yielded  this  result,  that</span><span>  whereas  the  Government  of  New  South  Wales</span></p> <p><span>  have  parted  with  twenty-four  millions  of  acres</span><span>  of  land,  ostensibly  for  purposes  of  cultivation,</span><span>  there  is  only  a  poor  half  million  under  crop.</span><span>  With  any  amount  of  good  land  in  the  upland</span><span>  regions,  having  a  splendid  climate  and  capable</span><span>  of  yielding  successive  crops  of  thirty  bushels</span><span>  an  acre,  New  South  Wales  is  yet  obliged  to</span><span>  import  thirty  to  forty  thousand  tons  of  bread</span><span>  stuffs  every  year.

Our  own</span><span>  Government,  howevi  -,  have  made  no</span><span>  sign,  and  we  conclu  e  that  no  official</span><span>  communication  in  r&lt;  erence  to  a  Cus-</span><span>  toms  Union  has  as  ret  reached  them</span><span>  from  the  Farnell  Miuii  ry.</span></p> <p><span>  The  manner  in  wilie  i  Australian  inter-</span><span>  colonial  trade  is  hat  ipered  by  fiscal</span><span>  barriers  is  much  to  1  2  regretted  ;  and</span><span>  we  cannot  but  think  that  the  uncon-</span><span>  ditional  separation  grai  ted  to  the  various</span><span>  colonies,  which  for  fiscal  purposes</span><span>  practically  divides  th  m  into  separate</span><span>  states,  was  a  mistake  1  f  a  grave  nature,</span><span>  and  its  early  rectif  ration  is  a  very</span><span>  proper  subject  (or  int  rcolonial  negotia-</span><span>  tion.  But  we  are  s  rongly  convinced</span><span>  that  the  practical  difiif.  lillies  which  stand</span><span>  in  the  way  of  this  re  :ti&lt;ication  are  not</span><span>  fully  appreciated  by  he  great  majority</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  advocates  for  ree  trade  between</span><span>  the  various  Australi  n  colonies.  The</span><span>  remarks  of  Captain  .'  milli,  Chairman  of</span><span>  thc  Sydney  Chamba  of  Commerce  on</span></p> <p><span>  this  subject,  were  of  s  flippant  character,  '</span><span>  which  seemed  to  in&lt;  icate  that  he  had  j</span></p> <p><span>  but  a  faint  idea  of  ivhat  his  proposal</span><span>  I  involved.  The  only  armidable  obstacle</span><span>  !  which  presented  itself  to  his  mind  lo  an</span><span>  Australian  zollverein  ivas  thc  protective</span><span>  tariff  of  Victoria  ;  but  he  saw  no  great</span><span>  difficulty  in  the  wi  f  of  a  Customs</span><span>  Union  betwixt  New  S  luth  M'aies,  South</span><span>  Australia,  and  Qui  ensland,  as  the</span><span>  tariffs  of  those  c  >lonics  did  not</span></p> <p><span>  differ  very  materially.  aDd  they  might</span><span>  easily  bc  nude  unifor  11.  Thc  Customs</span><span>  contributions  were  s  igVitly  higher  pei;</span><span>  head  of  the  populat  on  in  Queensland</span><span>  than  in  either  of  thc  I  wo  other  colonies,</span></p> <p><span>  i</span></p> <p><span>  but  any  differences  on  that  score  he</span><span>  thought  might  be  easly  arranged.</span></p> <p><span>  It  cannot  for  a  moi  lent  be  questioned</span><span>  that  thc  existence  of  ¡  rotective  duties  of</span></p> <p><span>  an  almost  prohibitory  :ind  in  one  colony,</span><span>  whilst  the  other  coloni  :s  generally  pursue</span><span>  a  more  liberal  polic;  ,  is  a  very  serious</span><span>  obstacle  to  any  mutt  al  arrangement  as</span><span>  regards  the  Custon  s  tariff;  but  to</span><span>  imagine  that  it  is  tl  e  only  one  worth</span><span>  serious  deliberation  vere  the  height  of</span><span>  folly.  It  must  be  rt  membered  that  the</span><span>  Customs  receipts  cc  nstitute  a  leading</span><span>  item  of  the  public  evenue,  and  one</span><span>  which  for  facility  &lt;  f  collection  and</span><span>  regularity  in  the  retun  s  is  in  high  favour</span><span>  with  men  who  kne  v  something  by</span><span>  personal  experience  i  f  the  business  of</span><span>  government.  In  th  :se  colonies,  the</span></p> <p><span>  value  of  the  Custom  j  louse  as  a  means</span></p> <p><span>  of  raising  thc  requis  Le  revenue  for  the</span><span>  expenses  of  the  genei  ú  Government,  is</span><span>  perhaps  even  more  1  eenly  appreciated</span><span>  than  in  older  count!  ;s,  as  the  fluctua-</span><span>  tions  of  colonial  life  a  e  very  great,  and</span><span>  a  steady  and  reliable  i  ourcc  of  revenue</span><span>  is  all  the  more  prized  on  this  account.</span><span>  With  the  high  rate  of  |  ublic  expenditure</span></p> <p><span>  maintained  in  these  co  onies  for  the  con-</span><span>  struction  of  railways  ai  d  other  works  for</span><span>  the  development  o  the  country's</span><span>  resources,  the  public  fi  lances  are  liable</span><span>  to  occasional  disorgai  isation,  and  the</span><span>  unalicnaled  Crown  la  ids  upon  whose</span><span>  security  our  public  «  jrks  arc  mainly</span><span>  undertaken  cannot  al'  :ays  bc  realised</span><span>  upon  in  a  time  of  fir  incial  panic  and</span><span>  depression.  It  therel  are  at  times  be-</span><span>  comes  necessary  to  p  wide  against  a</span><span>  failing  revenue  by  ad  litional  taxation.</span><span>  This  is  readily  done  th  ough  the  Custom</span><span>  House,  and  the  crisis  i  thus  tided  over.</span><span>  A  case  in  point  occurred  in  this  colony</span><span>  in  i  SÚ6,  and  may  occur  again.  It  is  not</span><span>  our  wish  to  anticipate  such  an  untoward</span><span>  event.  The  imposition  of  fresh  taxes  is</span><span>  at  all  times  unwelcome,  but  circum-</span><span>  stances  may  cause  it  to  be  regarded  as</span><span>  the  lesser  of  the  two  evils.  The  public</span><span>  credit  must  be  sustained  at  any  cost,  and</span><span>  it  would  be  a  false  policy  for  this  or  any</span><span>  other  community  needlessly  to  deprive</span><span>  itself  of  what  might  in  some  future</span><span>  emergency  prove  an  invaluable  means</span><span>  of  sustaining  that  credit.  For  this</span></p> <p><span>  reason  alone  we  think!  it  extremely</span><span>  improbable  that  any  Australian  Parlia-</span><span>  ment  or  Ministry  will  uoluntarily  relin-</span><span>  quish  its  direct  control  oi  cr  the  Customs</span><span>  revenue,  and  this  it  woult  do  by  entering</span><span>  into  a  Customs  Union,  as  ihetarifTof  one</span><span>  colony  could  not  be  alter  d  without  the</span><span>  consent  of  the  majority  &lt;  f  the  colonies</span><span>  concerned,  and  then  onl  -  by  a  tedious</span><span>  and  protracted  course  if  negotiation,</span><span>  which  would  render  s  ich  alteration</span><span>  valueless  for  a  time  of  pressing  emer-</span><span>  gency.  The  establishmei  t  of  a  Customs</span><span>  Union  in  these  colonies,  c  ;her  conditions</span><span>  remaining  as  they  now  ai  would  in  all</span><span>  probability,  at  some  not  rcmotejperiod,</span><span>  lead  to  the  imposition  if  an  Income</span><span>  Tax,  in  a  colony  cirmitvistanced  as</span><span>  Queensland  is,  with  no  other  resource</span><span>  immediately  available,  apd  we  cannot</span><span>  but  think  that  an  incorjic  lax  is  an</span></p> <p><span>  objectionable  means  of  raising  revenue.</span></p> <p><span>  It  will  doubtless,  on  tile  other  hand,</span><span>  be  argued  that  frequent  pbanges  in  the</span><span>  tariffs  arc  vexatious  to  trape,  and  that  it</span></p> <p><span>  is  better  to  retain  I  a  tariff  in</span></p> <p><span>  some  respects  notoriou  ly  bad  than  to</span><span>  make  frequent  alteratioi  s,  by  which  the</span></p> <p><span>  values  of  commodities  a  e  disturbed,  and</span><span>  Enterprise  receives  a  ilieclí.  It  will</span><span>  '  further  be  said  that  t  uniform  fixed</span></p> <p><span>  tariff  in  the  Australian  colonies  -would</span></p> <p><span>  be  an  immense  advantaj  j,  which  is  worth</span><span>  paying  for  at  a  high  fig  ire.  AH  this  we</span><span>  readily  concede,  but  si  ll  think  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  establishment  of  a  unifc  MU  tariff  between</span><span>  two  or  more  of  the  a  lonies  would  be</span></p> <p><span>  embarrassing,  unless  it  '  ere  accompanied</span><span>  by  fiscal  and  legislativ  :  changes  of  far</span><span>  wider  range,  involvin  ;  amongst  other</span><span>  things  the  adoption  of  a  Federal  system</span></p> <p><span>  of  Government.</span></p> <p><span>  But  a  uniform</span><span>  as  we  understand</span></p> <p><span>  main  object  of  the</span><span>  Customs  Union.  It  i</span></p> <p><span>  trade  which  is  chiefly</span></p> <p><span>  this  would  gteatly  red  ice  the  grand  total</span><span>  of  Customs  revenue,  ;  nd  some  individual</span><span>  members  of  the  Unie  n  would  specially</span><span>  suffer  from  this  :ause.  Probably</span><span>  Queensland  would  bi  the  greatest  loser</span><span>  by  the  arrangement,  nasmuch  as  a  large</span><span>  proportion  of  the  &lt;  ustoms  revenue  in</span><span>  this  colony  is  rais  d  by  duties  upon</span><span>  broken  packages  wi  ich  have  previously</span><span>  paid  duty  at  the  Syc  ney  Custom  House</span><span>  on  being  imported  in  bulk.  The  pro-</span><span>  portion  of  goods  ir  iported  direct  into</span><span>  this  colony  from  Gre  it  Britain  is  small,</span><span>  as  is  also  the  quant  y  of  goods  in  bulk</span><span>  received  from  Ne«  South  Wales  on</span><span>  which  drawback  is  a  lowed.  The  fact  is</span></p> <p><span>  that  Sydney  docs  a  large  ""  distributing</span><span>  trade  ""  with  this  co  jny,  and  this  raises</span><span>  a  difficulty  in  the  adj  istment  of  revenue</span><span>  differences  between  the  two  colonies</span></p> <p><span>  which  will  not  be  eas  ly  surmounted.  A</span><span>  similar  difficulty  will  e  found  in  adjust-</span><span>  ing  the  different  cl:  :ms  of  thc  other</span></p> <p><span>  colonies.</span></p> <p><span>  But  there  is  anotl  er  difficulty  which</span><span>  would  operate  greatlyjto  the  disadvantage</span><span>  of  Queensland.  Till  population  of  this</span></p> <p><span>  colony  consists  largcll  of  adult  males,  en-</span><span>  gaged  in  gold-miuingand  pastoral  pursuits,</span><span>  and  the  Customs  revemue  per  head  deriv-</span><span>  able  from  a  uniform  tariff  would  he  far</span></p> <p><span>  greater  in  this  colonJ  than  in  the  more</span><span>  settled  parts  of  Aultralia,  where  the</span><span>  sexes  are  nearly  equll  in  number,  and</span><span>  thc  adult  male  population  do  not  greatly</span><span>  preponderate.  Thislinequality  is  pro-</span><span>  bably  only  temporary,  but  it  may,</span><span>  notwithstanding,  continue  for  many  years,</span><span>  and  the  exigencies  of  llic  present  must</span><span>  not  be  sacrificed  lo  a  rblicy  which  trusts</span><span>  to  the  chances  of  thej  indefinite  future</span><span>  for  an  equitable  adjustment  of  rival</span></p> <p><span>  claims  as  between  thel  various  colonies</span></p> <p><span>  to  be  included  in  thc  plpposed  Union.</span></p> <p><span>  We  might  easily  gol  on  enumerating</span><span>  the  difficulties  which  ulposc  themselves</span><span>  to  a  Customs  Union,  lut  enough  has</span><span>  probably  been  said  tel  show  that  this</span><span>  subject  is  not  one  to  beVettled  by  a  few</span><span>  flippant  writers  or  spelkcrs;  and  the</span><span>  object  desired  will  not  le  furthered  by</span><span>  concealing  the  obstaclcslwhich  stand  in</span><span>  llic  way  of  its  accomplishment.</span></p> <p><span>  Thc  typhoid  fever  paticinV  at  Kurrajong  aie</span><span>  progressing  favourably.  ls\i  fresh  cases  are</span><span>  reported.</span></p> <p><span>  tariff  is  not,</span><span>  he  subject,  the</span></p> <p><span>  advocates  of  a</span><span>  intercolonial  free</span><span>  aimed  at.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  MARCH  2!),  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  OUGHT  a  member,  to  resign  if  called  &nbsp;</span><span>  upon  to  do  so  by  a  meeting  comprising</span></p> <p><span>  about  one-twelfth  of  his  constituents  ?  &nbsp;</span><span>  'I'his  is  a  question  which  now  forces</span><span>  itself  upon  the  attention  of  Mr.  Steven-</span></p> <p><span>  son,  the  member  for  Clermont  in  the  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  Legislative  Assembly.  It  is  a  question  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  also  which  ought  not  to  be  answered  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  hurriedly  in  the  affirmative,  at  any  rate,  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  and  we  presume  Mr.  Stevenson,  whatever</span></p> <p><span>  may  be  the  nature  of  his  feelings  on  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  subject,  will  not  permit  himself  to  be</span><span>  driven  hastily  eo  a  decision.  A  public  man</span><span>  who  undertakes  the  representation  of  a</span><span>  constituency  in  Parliament  incurs  a  heavy  &nbsp;</span><span>  responsibility,  and  he  would  be  un-</span><span>  faithful  to  his  trust  if,  while  conscious  of</span></p> <p><span>  having  done  his  best  fo  his  constituents  &nbsp;</span><span>  and  the  colony,  he  were  to  throw  off</span><span>  such  responsibility  at  the  dictation  of  a</span><span>  mere  fraction  of  his  constituents,  in  fact</span><span>  by  a  small  minority  even  of  those  who  &nbsp;</span><span>  opposed  his  election.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  case  of  Mr  Stevenson  not  a</span><span>  single  charge  has  been  substan-</span><span>  tiated  by  those  who  have  taken  &nbsp;</span><span>  public  action  against  him.  In  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  language  of  our  telegram,-""the  charges  &nbsp;</span><span>  were  that  he  had  neglected  his  con-  &nbsp;</span><span>  stituency,  and  had  done  nothing,</span><span>  although  public  buildings  were  much</span><span>  wanted  ;  that  he  had  wasted  the  session  &nbsp;</span><span>  by  useless  obstruction,  and  (greatest</span><span>  offence  of  all)  that  he  had  recently</span><span>  passed  Clermont  with  out  calling.""  Now</span><span>  most  of  this  is  palpably  untrue  and  un-  &nbsp;</span><span>  justifiable  ;  and  it  is  because  the  con-</span><span>  stituency  of  Clermont  is  likely  to  be  &nbsp;</span><span>  injured  by  the  late  demonstration  that  we  &nbsp;</span><span>  feel  bound  to  point  out  the  impropriety  &nbsp;</span><span>  of  the  proceedings.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Stevenson  is  accused,  primarily,</span><span>  of  having  ""  neglected  his  constituency,  &nbsp;</span><span>  and  done  nothing.""  Now;  everybody</span><span>  who  has  watched  the  proceedings  of  our</span><span>  Legislative  Assembly  must  know  that</span><span>  during  the  two  years  in  which  Mr.  &nbsp;</span><span>  Stevenson  has  represented  Clermont,  he  &nbsp;</span><span>  has  spent  nearly  half  that  time  in  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  assiduous  performance  of  his  parlia-  &nbsp;</span><span>  mentary  duties.  Last  session  he  was  in</span><span>  his  place  at  the  opening  of  Parliament  &nbsp;</span><span>  on  11th  May,  and  there  he  remained</span><span>  until  near  its  close  on  the  1st  November.</span><span>  Was  this  doing  nothing  ?  And  as  to  &nbsp;</span><span>  neglecting  his  constit  íency  during  the</span></p> <p><span>  session,  we  confident  y  appeal  to  any  |</span><span>  honorable  member  on  lie  point  It  is  un-</span><span>  deniable  that  he  too  c  every  available</span><span>  opportunity  of  advoc  ting  the  interests</span><span>  of  Clermont.  Ministerial  members  may</span><span>  say  that  he  was  iujuc  icious  or  obstruc-</span><span>  tive,  because  he  was  one  of  the  most</span><span>  pertinacious  of  the  0[  position  members,</span><span>  but  we  defy  them  tn  thfully  to  say  that</span><span>  he  ""  neglected  his  coi  stituency  and  did</span><span>  nothing.""  It  is  also  veil  known  that  on</span><span>  one  occasion,  when  both  sides  of  the</span><span>  House  were  satisfied  lo  pass  a  road  vote,</span><span>  Mr.  Stevenson  indi  ;nanily  complained</span><span>  of  the  injustice  d  me  lo  his  con-</span><span>  stituents,  and  refusal  to  let  the  item</span><span>  pass  until  the  Minister  for  Works</span><span>  gave  an  explicit  promise  to</span><span>  put  a  further  item  for  the  Clermont  dis\</span><span>  trict  on  the  Supplementary  Estimates.  1</span><span>  Every  member  of  [the  Assembly  must</span><span>  recollect  how  on  ;  that  occasion  Mr.</span><span>  Thorn  endeavoured  to  shuffle  out  of</span><span>  giving  the  requil  cid  pledge,  and  how</span><span>  ultimately  he  was  rdmpclled  to  do  so  by</span><span>  the  pertinacity  of  '.  Ir.  Stevenson.  Min-</span><span>  isterial  members  \  ?&lt;  re  naturally  angry  at</span><span>  the  ""  obstructive  iroceedings  of  the</span><span>  member  for  Clerm  jit,""  but  they  had  no</span><span>  injustice  to  compl  ii  of,  for  their  votes</span><span>  had  been  secured  jy  liberal  provision  on</span><span>  the  Estimates.  A  nd  not  only  did  Mr.</span><span>  Stevenson  extract  the  promise  from  the</span><span>  Minister,  but  he  ifterwards  took  every</span><span>  possible  precautic  1  to  malte  that  pro-</span><span>  mise  respected  ;  a  fl,  as  a  matter  of  fact,</span><span>  several  hundred  pc  linds  more  were  spent</span><span>  upon  Clermont  roads  last  year  than</span><span>  would  have  been!  available  had  Mr.</span><span>  Stevenson  not  obstructed.  Again,  a  sup-</span><span>  plementary  vote  waa  required  last  year  for</span><span>  the  Peak  Downs  Hospital.  Mr.  Stevenson</span><span>  endeavoured  to  gen  the  just  claims  of</span><span>  that  institution  recognised,  but  Ministers</span><span>  refused  to  do  so.  \ie,  therefore,  after</span><span>  all  other  measures!  had  proved  un-</span></p> <p><span>  availing,  tabled  al  motion  towards  !</span><span>  the  close  of  thel  sesión  for  an</span><span>  additional  grant  oft  ,£750.  Having</span><span>  satisfied  his  colleague^  on  the  Opposition</span></p> <p><span>  side  of  the  justice  of  his  claim,  and</span><span>  having  also  presented  it  in  an  unanswer-</span><span>  able  shape  to  thc  House  generally,  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Stevenson  convinced  jfhe  Government  ¡</span><span>  thal  thc  majority  was  atdinst  them,  and  j</span><span>  so  compelled  them  lo  yi(  lp.  The  money  !</span><span>  was  obtained,  and  has  Jeen  for  months  '</span><span>  past  available.  Was  I  tat  ""  neglecting  '</span><span>  the  constituency,""  or  ""  poing  nothing  ?""  ?</span><span>  Wc  repeat  that  Mr.  St  :venson  worked  j</span></p> <p><span>  hard  for  his  constituent  in  Parliament.  !</span></p> <p><span>  What  he  has  done  ir  failed  to  do  j</span></p> <p><span>  privately  on  their  b:half,  we  can-</span><span>  not  say  ;  but  thc  a  mouncement  in</span></p> <p><span>  lasl  week's  Clermont  pa]  ers  thal  at  length  1</span></p> <p><span>  an  extended  commo  läge  for  thc!  town</span><span>  had  been  obtained,  s  »ould  have  j£tvu|ed</span><span>  the  speakers  to  bc  nore  measufei'  in</span><span>  their  denunciations.  We  liaujf  n  lo</span></p> <p><span>  know  that  Mr.  Ste  ensuit  took  con-</span><span>  siderable  trouble  in  tl  is  very  matter,  and</span><span>  have  no  doubt  that  t  e  constituency  are</span><span>  indebted  to  Iiis  efibrt  for  thc  concession</span><span>  just  made  by  the  (  oveimnent  on  the</span><span>  point.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  railway  r  ueslion,  loo,  it  is</span><span>  well  known  thal  Mr  Stevenson  during</span><span>  the  session  of  187Ö  fi  light  single-handed</span><span>  in  favour  of  the  rai  way  being  carried</span><span>  to  Clermont,  and  t  was  only  after</span><span>  that  session's  fruitiest  advocacy  that  he</span><span>  visited  Clermont,  an  i  plainly  told  his</span><span>  constituents  thal  it  &lt;  as  useless  to  press</span></p> <p><span>  that  question  further  -that  the  policy  '</span></p> <p><span>  now  to  be  advocated  was  the  construc-</span><span>  tion  of  a  branch  line.

Since  then</span><span>  Mr.  Stevenson  has  pei  ;islcntly  advocated</span></p> <p><span>  the  construction  c  f  the  Clermont</span></p> <p><span>  branch,  and,  from  h  s  uncompromising</span><span>  attitude  on  the  point,  we  feel</span><span>  assured  that  had  thc  Government</span></p> <p><span>  submitted  the  questio  1  whether  the  Cler-</span><span>  mont  branch  or  the  w  :stern  line  should</span><span>  be  first  constructed,  M  r.

No  other  Central</span></p> <p><span>  member  has  officially  visited  his  consti-  I</span><span>  tucnts  during  the  rece  is,  and  why  Mr.  !</span><span>  Stevenson  should  be  lid  i  up  as  neglectful  .</span><span>  for  failing  to  do  so  is  n  it  apparent.

Hut  these  confident  prognos-</span><span>  tications  have  all  been  .signally  falsified  by</span></p> <p><span>  the  issue  of  this  remarkable  election.</span></p> <p><span>  At  thc  outset  of  the  contest  the  field</span><span>  was  occupied  by  Messrs.

This  Mr.  Salkeld,  wc  may</span><span>  state,  came  owl  as  an  ¡  vowed  supporter</span><span>  of  thc  Douglas  Ministry,  and</span><span>  was  looked  upon  as  their  nominee.  Thc</span><span>  men  who  rule  Ipswicl  in  matters  poli-</span><span>  tical  also  pronounce!  in  favour  of</span><span>  Salkeld.  All  (his  int)  lentiai  support,  it</span><span>  was  naturally  thought  should  have  due</span><span>  weight  with  a  prc  cmi  ently  agricultural</span><span>  community,  and  Mr.  Í  ilkeld  was  al  thc</span><span>  outset  regarded  as  tl  e  winning  candi-</span><span>  date.

He</span><span>  was  at  first  receivei  Í  favourably,  though</span><span>  a  comparative  strai  ger-at  least  in  a</span><span>  political  sense,-bu  everything  seemed</span><span>  to  work  in  his  inlerc't.  First  of  all  it  is</span><span>  to  be  noticed  that  the  ex-member,  Mr.</span><span>  John  Thorn,  who,  wi  ¡1st  in  the  Assembly,</span><span>  had  sat  on  wh,  t  is  called  thc</span><span>  Liberal  side  of  the  House,  and</span><span>  had  always  bee  1  a  consistent</span><span>  though  silent  ¡  upporter  of  the</span><span>  Thorn-Douglas  Mil  islry,  gave  his  sup-</span><span>  port  and  couutenaii  :e  to  Mr.  Persse,  a</span><span>  gentleman  whose  sympathies  are  not</span><span>  with  the  Governn  ent,  but  with  the</span><span>  Opposition.  This  ii  troduced  an  clement</span><span>  of  confusion  which  lad  not  been  antici</span><span>  !  pated,  and  no  one  :  eenicd  to  be  able  to</span></p> <p><span>  foretell  what  wout*  '  come  of  it.  Mr.</span><span>  Thorn  by  this  cours  :  was  not  only  acting</span><span>  against  the  DnugI;  s  Government,  but</span><span>  against  the  political  leaders  of  Ipswich.</span><span>  Hut  the  Fassifern  far  ners  did  not  reproach</span><span>  him  for  his  apparc  it  inconsistency  ;  on</span><span>  the  contrary,  they  fierwards  showed  by</span><span>  their  votes  that  I  icy  did  not  require</span><span>  even  Mr.  John  Tl«  in's  influence  to  turn</span><span>  the  scale  in  their  favour,  as  they  were</span><span>  nearly  all  of  the  SJ  ne  mind,  and  were</span><span>  determined  to  cut  all  connection  with</span><span>  their  whilom  lcadei  >.  It  is  difficult  to</span><span>  understand  the  con  Lunation  of  influences</span><span>  which  led  the  eic  tors  of  Fassifern  to</span></p> <p><span>  pronounce  so  dcci&lt;  edly  in  favour  of  the</span><span>  gentleman  who  hi  s  been  returned  as</span><span>  their  member,  but  we  will  endeavour  to</span><span>  state  a  few  facts  which  may  serve  to</span><span>  explain  in  some  tn&lt;  isure  the  reason  why</span><span>  the  two  Ipswich  andidates  have  been</span><span>  ignominously  rejec  ed,  and  a  man  sup-</span><span>  posed  to  possess  lit  lc  influence  over  the</span><span>  constituency  has  1  cen  accepted  by  a</span><span>  most  convincing  m¡  ¡ority.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  first  plao  ,  we  may  state  that</span><span>  Mr.  Persse,  althougl  not  resident  within</span><span>  the  bounds  of  what  s  commonly  under-</span><span>  stood  to  bc  thc  J  assifern  district,  is</span><span>  notwithstanding  a  resident  in  thc</span><span>  Fassifern  electorate  Tabragalba,  Mr.</span><span>  Terese's  station,  is  ii  that  part  of  the</span><span>  Upper  Logan  em  jraced  within  the</span><span>  boundaries  of  the  ¡lectora!  district  of</span><span>  Fassifern,  although  rom  the  configura-</span><span>  tion  of  the  country  i  a  measure  cut  off</span><span>  from  communicant  n  with  Fassifern</span><span>  proper,  and  the  vo  ers  on  the  Logan</span><span>  side  had  never  taken  a  very  active</span><span>  interest  in  the  Fassifern  politics.  The</span><span>  fact  of  Mr.  Persse]  coming  forward,</span></p> <p><span>  however,  seems  to  have  stirred  them  up</span><span>  to  exercise  their  electoral  privileges.</span><span>  This  gentleman  is  in  old  resident  in</span><span>  their  district,  and  stands  high  in  their</span><span>  esteem.  He  is  no.  a  man  of  very</span><span>  decided  political  vi:ws,  but  possesses</span><span>  good  sense  and  an  untarnished  reputa-</span><span>  tion.  He  has  a  so  very  recently</span><span>  helped  to  ingraliat:  himself  in  their</span><span>  favour  by  taking  a)  active  part  in  the</span><span>  agitation  for  a  deviat  on  of  the  proposed</span><span>  railway  from  Oxley  o  Beenleigh,  so  as</span><span>  to  serve  the  settlers  o  the  Upper  Logan  ;</span><span>  and  this  in  itself  w  uld  probably  have</span><span>  been  sufficient  to  sec  ire  the  votes  of  the</span><span>  Upper  Logan  people  who  naturally  feel</span><span>  that  with  Mr.  M'L  .un  in  the  House</span><span>  decidedly  opposed  Ito  this  deviation,</span><span>  they  greatly  need  ail  advocate  of  their</span></p> <p><span>  special  claims.  It/  might  have  been</span><span>  supposed,  however/  that  this  Logan</span><span>  railway  would  have  [donc  M  r.  Persse  as</span></p> <p><span>  much  harm  as  good,  inasmuch  as  thc</span><span>  electors  of  Fassifern  proper  arc  anxious</span><span>  to  pet  their  own  line  made  from  Ipswich,</span><span>  and  might  therefore  prefer  a  member</span><span>  who  would  devote  all  his  advocacy  to</span><span>  their  own  particular  railway,  and  en</span><span>  deavour  to  secure  that,  regardless</span></p> <p><span>  of  all  others.  Hut  no  such</span></p> <p><span>  feeling  appears  lo  have  animated</span><span>  thc  large  body  of  the  electors.  Perhaps</span><span>  thus  finds  a  partial  explanation  in  a  state</span><span>  ment  in  the  Qiiiatshi'itl  Times.  Thai</span><span>  journal  of  thc  i  ith  instant  says:-""Wc</span><span>  should  not  have  regarded  the  return,  oi</span></p> <p><span>  an  independent  men  ber  as  of  so  much  im-</span><span>  portance,  were  it  t  ot  that  within  the</span><span>  past  day  or  two  it  I  as  leaked  out  that</span><span>  the  Government  hav  ;  definitely  decided</span></p> <p><span>  not  lo  construct  the  Fassifern  or  Mount  j</span></p> <p><span>  Esk  linc.

Immigration  Agent,  visited</span></p> <p><span>  Rockhampton  yesterday  chiefly  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  purpose  of  inspecting  Johnson's  patent  berthing</span><span>  for  immigrants,  with  which  thc  Scottish  &nbsp;</span><span>  Knight  is  fitted.  Mr.  Grey  accompanied  by</span><span>  Mr.  Salmond,  went  on  board  at  eleven  o'clock,</span><span>  and  minutely  inspected  the  fittings,  he  was  &nbsp;</span><span>  decidedly  of  opinion  thai,  they  were  a  great</span><span>  improvement  on  the  usual  berths  for  the</span><span>  accommodation  of  families  securing  privacy  &nbsp;</span><span>  and  ventilation  in  a  greater  degree  than  any  &nbsp;</span><span>  hitherto  in  use.  These  two  requisites  seem  in  &nbsp;</span><span>  their  nature  opposed,  with  Johnson's  patent  &nbsp;</span><span>  fittings,  while  high  enough  to  secure  privacy,</span><span>  do  not  reach  to  the  deck  overhead  but  leave</span><span>  a  free  space  of  nearly  a  foot  for  a  draught  to</span><span>  permeate  the  whole  apartment.  Another  &nbsp;</span><span>  specialty  provided  by  them  is  the  facility  &nbsp;</span><span>  they  afield  for  each  family  to  mess  by  itself,  &nbsp;</span><span>  and  this  convenience  was  highly  appreciated</span><span>  by  the  married  passengers.  Another  advantage  &nbsp;</span><span>  allowed  by  them  is  that  the  apartments  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  may  easily  be  kept  clean  Mr.  Grey  will  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  recommend  that  in  all  future  contracts  with</span></p> <p><span>  our  Government,  a  provision  be  inserted  to  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  equip  immigrant  vessels  with  Johnson's  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  berthing.  We  are  informed  that  the  South  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  Australian  Government  have  adopted  the  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  improvement.  It  is  fortunate  for  Rockhampton  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  that  a  line  of  vessels  so  superior  as  the</span><span>  ""Scottish,''  trades  with  the  port,  and  it  is  to  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  be  hoped  the  owners  will  receive  the  support</span><span>  both  of  the  Governments  and  our  merchants.</span><span>  Messrs.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  AUGUST  8,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  report  of  the  directors  of  the  New</span><span>  Peak  Downs  Copper  Mining  Company,</span><span>  which  has  been  circulated  amongst  the</span><span>  shareholders  in  anticipation  of  the  half</span><span>  yearly  meeting  of  the  Company,  and</span><span>  which  has  been  published  in  our</span><span>  columns  for  public  information,  is  a</span><span>  document  deserving  of  attentive  ex-</span><span>  amination.  The  report  embraces  the</span><span>  full  period  of  six  months,  from  January</span><span>  to  June  inclusive,  but  nearly  a  third  of</span><span>  that  time  was  taken  up  with  works  of  a</span><span>  preliminary  nature,  and  ordinary  mining</span><span>  and  smelting  operations  only  began  to-</span><span>  wards  the  end  of  February,  leaving  but</span><span>  little  more  than  fonr  months  as  the</span></p> <p><span>  period  during  which  the  productive</span><span>  powers  of  the  mine  were  being  proved.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  balance  sheet  for  the  half-year,</span><span>  credit  is  taken  for  224  tons  of  copper  in</span><span>  transit,  valued  at  £60  per  ton  at  the</span><span>  mine,  making  a  total  of  ,£  13,447,  to</span><span>  which  is  added  money  paid  for  carriage,</span><span>  insurance,  commission,  &c,  £1506  ;</span><span>  then  follows  copper  in  stock,</span><span>  12  tons,  £722',  ores  at  grass</span><span>  1217  tons  (estimated  to  con-</span><span>  tain  io  per  cent  of  copper,</span><span>  £7302t  'ess  reducing  charges  .£2556)</span><span>  £4736  :  making  a  total  net  value  of</span><span>  copper  in  transit  and  ore  at  grass,  of</span><span>  ,£20,421.  Cash  paid  for  mine,  stores  on</span><span>  hand  as  per  stock  list,  firewood,  and</span><span>  other  items,  make  up  a  grand  total</span><span>  £24,866  on  the  credit  side  of  the</span><span>  account.  On  the  other  side  is  placed</span><span>  £10,000,  the  amount  of  subscribed</span><span>  capital,  advances  from  banks  £9388,</span><span>  bills  payable  £2668,  and  sundry</span><span>  liabilities-leaving  a  balance  to  credit  of</span><span>  profit  and  loss  of  ,£2911-being  a</span><span>  return  at  the  rate  of  about  ,£6000  per</span><span>  annum  on  a  capital  of  ,£10,000.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  necessary,  however,  to  observe</span><span>  that  this  is  not  realised  profit,  but  an</span><span>  estimate  merely,  the  accuracy  of  which</span><span>  will  depend  onthepercentage  of  copper  in</span><span>  the  ores  at  grass  coming  up  to  expecta-</span><span>  tions,  and  also  ontheprice  of  copper  inthe</span><span>  London  market  covering  the  estimate  of</span><span>  £60  per  ton,  with  charges  added.</span><span>  Still  the  estimate  appears  a  reasonable</span></p> <p><span>  one.</span></p> <p><span>  The  large  amount  set  down  as  ad-</span><span>  vances  from  banks  will  doubtless  be</span></p> <p><span>  carefully  scrutinised,  and  this  item  of</span><span>  indebtedness  must  be  inconveniently</span><span>  large.  The  chief  causéis  apparently  to  be</span><span>  found  in  the  difficulties  experienced  in</span><span>  procuring  a  sufficient  supply  of  firewood,</span></p> <p><span>  ami  -carrying  na_smrij'rui.  nf^ünns  at  a</span></p> <p><span>  rate  of  speed  equal  to  that  mainuilnecT  in</span><span>  me  lalsing  of  ore.  The  ore  at  grass,  it</span><span>  is  stated,  has  accumulated  considerably</span><span>  since  the  new  Company  took  charge  of</span><span>  the  mine,  and  this  accumulation  repre-</span><span>  sents  capital  lying  idle,  whilst  the  Com-</span><span>  pany  is  compelled  to  borrow  from  the</span><span>  banks  at  current  rates  of  interest.  It  is</span></p> <p><span>  I  evidently  with  the  object  of  meeting  this</span></p> <p><span>  difficulty  that  the  directors  hare  decided</span><span>  upon  issuing  the  reserved  5000  stares,</span><span>  and  they  propose  by  the  funds  thus</span><span>  I  raised  to  ensure  a  permanent  and  ade-</span></p> <p><span>  quate  supply  of  fuel  by  the  ""con-</span><span>  struction  of  a  tramway  to  the  thickly</span><span>  timbered  country,  which  might  be</span><span>  ultimately  extended  to  the  Com-</span><span>  pany's  coal  selection  at  Blair  Athol.""</span><span>  The  Mining  manager,  Mr.  Bryant,</span><span>  reports  in  favour  of  a  light  tramway  to</span><span>  be  worked  by  a  small  locomotive  ;  and</span><span>  the  smelting  manager  makes  a  similar</span><span>  recommendation,  observing,  that  coal</span><span>  is  in  every  way  preferable  to  wood,  as</span><span>  more  work  could  be  done  with  it,  and</span><span>  the  furnaces  could  be  kept  going  in  all</span><span>  weathers-the  latter  advantage  alone</span></p> <p><span>  reducing  the  cost  of  smelting  by  5s,  pet  I</span></p> <p><span>  ton  of  ore.  Two  tons  of  coal,  he  adds,</span><span>  would  do  as  much  work  as  three  tons  of</span><span>  wood,  and  by  its  aid,  as  a  fluxing  agent,</span></p> <p><span>  the  most  refractory  ores  could  be  made  I</span><span>  to  yield  the  copper  contained  in  them,</span><span>  and  the  present  uncertainty  attending  the</span><span>  smelting  would  cease.  Regularity  would</span></p> <p><span>  also  be  ensured,  as  well  as  the  certainty  !</span></p> <p><span>  of  obtaining  a  definite  quantity  of  copper</span><span>  in  a  given  time.  Mr.  Blackmore  is</span></p> <p><span>  thoroughly  convinced  of  the  advisa-  j</span><span>  bility  of  endeavouring  to  obtain  coal  for  !</span><span>  fuel,  and  thinks  that  if  50  tons  were  pro-</span><span>  cured  from  the  company's  selection,  and</span></p> <p><span>  found  suitable  for  smelting,  the  Board  j</span><span>  might  consider  the  fuel  difficulty  at  an  I</span><span>  end,  and  the  prosperity  of  the  Company</span><span>  assured  beyond  the  shadow  of  a  doubt.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  assumed  that  coal  could  be  raised  j</span><span>  at  Blair  Athol  and  delivered  at  Copper-  !</span></p> <p><span>  field  at  a  lower  rate  than  is  now  paid  for</span><span>  wood.  We  have  no  data  to  guide  us  in</span><span>  forming  an  opinion  upon  this  question,</span></p> <p><span>  but  if  the  advantages  to  be  gained  by  !</span><span>  the  use  of  coal  are  as  stated,  there  i's</span><span>  good  reason  why  the  Company  should</span><span>  endeavour  to  utilise  their  coal  selection</span><span>  as  soon  as  practicable.</span></p> <p><span>  But  the  provision  of  a  sufficient  supply</span><span>  of  good  fuel  is  not  the  only  essential  to</span><span>  the  successful  and  speedy  reduction  of</span><span>  ores.  The  smelting  manager,  referring  to</span><span>  this  subject,  throws  some  further  light  on</span><span>  the  causes  which  have  delayed  smelting</span><span>  operations.  He  says  there  is  now  lying</span><span>  at  thc  works  a  large  quantity  of  ores  of  a</span><span>  very  refractory  nature.  To  reduce  these</span><span>  an  equal  quantity  of  ores  rich  in  sulphur</span><span>  will  be  required  ;  .md  even  were  the</span><span>  supply  of  firewood  doubled,  no  ad-</span><span>  ditional  furnaces  could  be  put  on  to</span></p> <p><span>  reduce  the  ores  in  stock  until</span></p> <p><span>  a  much  larger  supply  of  snl</span><span>  pliurct  ores  is  obtained.  The  value</span><span>  of  all  kinds  of  copper  ores  depends</span><span>  almost  as  much  on  their  fusible,  as  on</span><span>  their  copper-bearing  qualities-the  latter</span><span>  often  occupying  a  too  prominent  place</span><span>  in  determining  their  value.  From  thc</span></p> <p><span>  description  given  by  the  Mining</span><span>  Manager  of  the  different  kinds  of  ores  in</span><span>  the  various  shafts  at  present  being</span><span>  worked,  we  should  suppose  that  the</span><span>  requisite  quantity  of  fusible  ores  can</span><span>  readily  be  obtained,  and  all  that  is</span><span>  wanted  is  systematic  management  and</span><span>  supervision.  It  is  useless  to  spend</span><span>  money  in  raising  refractory  ores  without</span><span>  contemporaneous  provision  for  the</span><span>  supply  of  a  class  of  readily  fusible  ores,</span><span>  in  order  that  all  kinds  may  be</span><span>  systematically  reduced  as  they  are</span><span>  raised  from  the  mine.  The  usc  of  coal</span></p> <p><span>  would  of  course  materially  diminish  thc</span><span>  difficulty  of  reducing  ores,  but  in  any</span><span>  case  the  supervision  of  mining  operations,</span><span>  so  as  to  provide  ores  suitable  for  thc</span><span>  furnaces,  will  be  an  essential  condition</span><span>  of  the  economical  working  of  the  mine.</span></p> <p><span>  Three  valuable  discoveries  of  ores</span><span>  are  reported  to  have  been  made  under</span><span>  the  new  proprietary-one  at  120</span><span>  fathoms,  and  another  at  70  fathoms,</span><span>  west  of  Thom's  Shaft.

Mr.  Hartley  brought</span><span>  under  the  notice  of  the  Committee  the  casos</span><span>  of  two  women  who  were  receiving  relief  at</span><span>  present-one  of  whom  was  afflicted  with  a</span><span>  distressing  hiccough  and  incurable  hysteria,  and</span><span>  thc  other  had  three  children  and  would  not</span><span>  work.  It  was  a  question  whether,  with  re-</span><span>  gard  to  the  first  case,  it  would  not  be  better</span><span>  to  send  the  woman  to  Brisbane  or  Sydney,</span><span>  where,  it  appeared,  she  had  friends,  and  where</span><span>  there  were  better  means  of  dealing  with  her</span><span>  ailment,  rather  than  she  should  continue  a</span></p> <p><span>  permanent  burden  to  the  Society.  The  Lady  I</span><span>  President  disapproved  of  spending  thc  funds</span><span>  of  thc  Society  in  paying  passages.  She  felt</span><span>  it  was  throwing  a  slight  on  the  medical</span></p> <p><span>  gentlemen  of  the  town  to  suppose  that  the  j</span></p> <p><span>  girl  could  be  more  skilfully  treated  elsewhere  ;  1</span><span>  and  at  least,  until  the  funds  of  the  Society</span><span>  were  in  a  flourishing  condition,  she  thought</span><span>  it  would  be  advisable  to  postpone  tho  con-</span><span>  sideration  of  sending  ber  to  Brisbane  or</span><span>  Sydney.  After  considerable  conversation,  it</span><span>  was  moved  hy  Mr.  Hartley,  and  seconded  by</span><span>  Mrs.  Orr,  that  tho  matter  be  left  to  thc</span><span>  discretion  of  the  Hon.

It  is  needless  tocxplain  the</span><span>  plot  of  the  piece,  as  it  is  (»miliar  tu  most</span><span>  play-goers  ;  suffice  it  to  say,  that  for  variety</span><span>  oí  incident,  liveliness  of  dialogue,  and  the</span><span>  scope  which  it  gives  for  good  play,  it  is  not</span><span>  surpassed  hy  any  other  of  Pion  Boucicault's</span><span>  world-wide  dramas.

Mr.  Carey,  as  Com,  sus-</span><span>  tained  the  high  expectations  of  thc  audience,</span><span>  and  even  surpassed  his  usual  acting.  Ho  was</span><span>  greeted  with  uproarious  and  prolonged  ap-</span><span>  plause.

We  cannot,  however,  close  without</span><span>  referring  to  thc  admirable  mechanism  in  thc</span><span>  secoudactof  the  revolving  tower,  which  reflects</span><span>  thc  greatest  credit  on  Mr.  Vincent,  especially</span><span>  when  it  is  considered  what  difficulty  lie</span><span>  laboured  under  hy  thc  smallness  of  the  stage.</span><span>  At  no  previous  performance  have  the  sympa-</span><span>  thies  of  the  audience  been  more  in  accord  with</span><span>  thc  efforts  of  thc  players,  and  thc  result  was</span><span>  an  entertainment  which,  as  expressed  by  thc</span><span>  heartiness  of  their  applause,  delighted  all  who</span><span>  witnessed  it.  Thc  same  programme  «""ill  bc</span><span>  repeated  to-night.</span></p> <p><span>  YESTEIIDAV  evening,  the  Kev,  J.  Spence,  of</span><span>  Maryborough,  lectured  in  the  Wesleyan</span><span>  Church,  Kent-street,  on  ""Famous  Hymns  and</span><span>  their  Authors.""  There  was  a  fair  atten-</span><span>  dance  The  ficv.  J.  F.  Orr,  pastor  of  the</span><span>  church,  occupied  the  chair,  and  briefly  intro-</span><span>  duced  the  lecturer.  Mr.  Spence  prefaced  his</span><span>  subject  by  referring  to  the  influence  of  songs</span><span>  on  thc  national  and  religious  life  of  a  people.</span><span>  Whatever  the  characteristic  feelings  of  a</span><span>  nation  were,  they  found  an  outlet  in  words</span><span>  wedded  to  music  of  more  or  less  beauty,  and</span><span>  were  embalmed  in  thc  ballads  and  patriotic</span><span>  songs  of  tlic  country.  Thus  lyrical  produc-</span><span>  tions  hod  exercised  great  influence  at  critical</span><span>  periods  of  history  by  directing  the  current  of</span><span>  of  opinion  in  a  particular  channel,  and  not  less</span><span>  powerfully  had  sacred  songs  stimulated  thc</span><span>  religious  life  of  men.  It  would  be</span><span>  impossible  to  estimate  thc  influence</span><span>  for  good  which  thc  authors  of  celebrated</span><span>  hymus  had  had  upon  thc  public  mind.  The</span><span>  lecturer  then  referred  to  Charles  Wesley  and</span><span>  Dr.  Watts,  enumeratiug  a  few  of  their  most</span><span>  prominent  productions  ;  to  Oliver,  author  of</span><span>  the  hymn  commencing  with,  ""Tho  God  of</span><span>  Abraham  praise  ;""  Byrom,  who  wrote,</span><span>  ""Christian,  awake,  salute  thc  happy  moni  ¡""</span><span>  Pcrrouet,  the  writer  of  ""All  hail  the  power  of</span><span>  Jean's  name;""  Cowper,  ""God  moves  ia  a</span><span>  mysterious  way  ;""  Montgomery,  ""  Prayer  is</span><span>  the  soul's  sincere  desire;""  Lyte,  ""Abide</span><span>  with  mc  j""  Keble,  ""  Sou  of  my  soul,  thou</span><span>  Saviour  dear;""  and  to  Toplady,  the  author  of</span><span>  the  beautiful  hymn,  ""  flock  of  ages,  cleft  for</span><span>  mc.""  Mr.  Spence  referred  at  eome  length  to</span><span>  tbo  particular  beauties  of  these  hymns,  and</span><span>  gave  sonic  interesting  focia  connected  with  the</span><span>  lives  of  their  authors.  The  choir,  under  the</span><span>  leadership  of  Mr.  Bickle,  rendered  very</span><span>  tastefully  several  of  the  hymns  referred</span><span>  to,  and  contributed  not  a  little  to</span><span>  tho  pleasure  of  the  auditors.  The</span><span>  lecturer  remarked  that  it  was  impossible  for</span><span>  him,  in  the  necessarily  short  time  at  bis  dis-</span><span>  posal,  to  refer  to  all  or  even  many  of  the</span><span>  hymns  justly  famous  for  poetic  sentiment  and</span><span>  elegance  of  language  ;  but  lie  trusted,  from  the</span><span>  few  that  had  been  mentioned,  that  hie  hearers</span><span>  had  been  interested,  and  that  they  would</span><span>  learn  to  prize  them  by  cherishing  them  in  their</span><span>  memory,  and  endeavoring  to  carry  out  in</span><span>  evey-day  life  the  simple  yet  beautiful  morality</span><span>  which  they  inculcated.  At  the  conclusion,  as</span><span>  well  os  at  other  parts  of  the  lecture,  Mr.</span><span>  Spence  was  warmly  applauded.  After  the</span><span>  usual  vote  of  thanks,  the  meeting  was  brought</span></p> <p><span>  to  a  close.</span></p> <p><span>  DB.

This,  I</span><span>  in  fact,  was  Mr.  M'llwraith's  -strong  j</span><span>  point,  while  the  Premier  sought  to  j</span><span>  evoke  an  expression  of  opinion  against  I</span></p> <p><span>  trunk  lines  and  in  favour  of  branches.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  gratifying  to  firid.'höwcyer,  that  his</span><span>  opinions  do  not  seem  to  be  shared  by</span><span>  a  single:  leading  member  of  the</span><span>  -Assembly,  for  Mr.  Griffith's  support  of</span><span>  them  was  mere  special  '  pleading.

'  They  i*uld</span><span>  like  jto  seè  trunk  lines  built,  and  p'fess</span><span>  a  high'  appreciation  of  their  utility;  but</span><span>  they  would  not  have  them  constructed  at</span><span>  the  public  expense.  Their  chief  reason</span><span>  seems  to  be  the  belief  that  the  money</span><span>  spptit  on  Tàflivayç  is  spent  in  the  thinly</span><span>  peopled  '  squatting  districts,  instead.  of</span><span>  being  disbursed  among  the  ""  masses  oí</span><span>  the  people.""  By  which  they  mean  that</span><span>  the  country  should  stop  the  construction</span><span>  of  the  great  trank  railways,  and  make</span><span>  lines  from  Brisbane  'to  Sandgate,  Bris-</span><span>  bane  to  the-Logan,  Brisbane  to  Bulimba,</span><span>  and  South  .  Brisbane  to  Oxley.  This,</span><span>  indeed,  is,,fyi!-.Douglas*  bait,  and  we</span><span>  Deed  -opt  wonder  that  it  has  captivated</span><span>  the  metropoli  tans,  orthat;eVen  the  self</span><span>  co'ristit'uted  Opposition  Attornèy-General,</span><span>  Mr.  Pring,  has  fairly  swallowed  the  hook,</span><span>  Mr.  Macdonald  excepted,  the  central</span><span>  members  all  voted  in  favour  of  the</span><span>  trunk  lines,  and  Messrs.  Palmer,  Fpx,</span><span>  Macfarlane,  and  '  '  Morehead.,  spoke</span><span>  effectively  in  their  favour.:  But  the</span><span>  honorable  member  for  Blackall  remained</span><span>  dumb,  and  ^recorded  his  vote  with</span><span>  Mfiists,  Pouglas,  Grimes,  Hockings,  and</span><span>  Company,  all  of  whom  wished  to  see  the</span><span>  public1  expenditure  on  our  trunk  lines</span><span>  cease.  Mr.  Beattie,  too,  who  usually</span><span>  affects  great  breadth  of  sympathy  and</span><span>  paternal  affection  for  the  north,  wanted</span><span>  bur  ïâflway  carried  tb  Clermont  and  stop</span><span>  tnere,  in  order  that  some  money,  might</span><span>  be  spent'  in-  the  agricultural  '  districts,</span><span>  which  means  on  the  branch  lines  above</span><span>  named.'  Mr.  Douglas  has  quite  changed</span><span>  his  r^Mor^  <W,îbis^ubjecL  .Last  year</span></p> <p><span>  he  wanted  the  railway  carried  from  the</span><span>  Brisbane  terminus  to  the  Queen's  Wharf,</span><span>  and  discountenanced  the  Bulimba  and</span><span>  South  Brisbane  extensions.  Now  he</span><span>  has  dropped  the  Queen's  Wharf  project,</span><span>  and  wishes  to  place  the  lines  to</span><span>  Bulimba  and  South  Brisbane  in  the</span><span>  category  of  national  works  in  urgent  need</span><span>  of  construction.  .The  reason  is  only  too</span><span>  palpable  to  everyone  behind  the  scenes.</span><span>  The  member  for  Fortitude  Valley,  be-</span><span>  sides  his  own  constituents,  represents  a</span><span>  ring  of  Queen-street  land  speculators  who</span><span>  have  acquired  large  areas  at  Bulimba,  in</span><span>  the  belief  that  the  railway  will  be  run</span><span>  there  ;  and  the  member  for  South  Bris-</span><span>  bane  is  of  course  wedded  to  the  Oxley</span><span>  project.  Both  these,  honorable  members</span><span>  were  beginning  to  get  very  rusty  with  the</span><span>  Government,  and  have  showed  their</span><span>  independence  by  voting  with  the  Oppo-</span><span>  sition  more  than  once.  Their  loyalty,</span><span>  however,  is  now  sure,  and  there  are  to-</span><span>  day  no  warmer  supporters  of  Mr.  Doug-</span><span>  las  than  these  same  gentlemen.  With</span><span>  regard  to  Mr.  Grimes,  his  position  was</span><span>  happily  described  by  Mr.  M'llwraith,  as</span><span>  the  member  for  Bulimba,  who  would</span><span>  vote  against  every  railway  in  the  colony</span><span>  except  the  Bulimba  line.  But  none  of</span><span>  these  meñháveany  influcnceinlbe  House,</span><span>  nor  would  they  be  cultivated  by  the  Go-</span><span>  vernment  were  it  not  that  their  majority</span><span>  of  one  is  completed  by  Mr.  Morgan,  die</span><span>  invalided  chairman  of  committees  with</span><span>  thc  broken  leg.  A  weak  Ministry  is</span><span>  always  a  source  of  danger  because  its</span><span>  existence  hangs  by  a  thread  and  it  is</span><span>  compelled  to  buy  support  at  whatever</span><span>  price  it  can  be  obtained.</span></p> <p><span>  The  new  member  for  Fassifern,  who</span><span>  was  returned  in  (he  Opposition  interest,</span><span>  but  who  deemed  himself  pledged  lo  give</span><span>  the  Government  provisional  support,  has</span><span>  been  completely  alienated  by  the  dis-</span><span>  closure  of  the  Government's  future  rai!  iva  y</span><span>  policy.  He  has  lived  four  years  in  the</span><span>  heart  of  Australia,  and  has  drawn  his</span><span>  supplies  from  and  sent  his  wool  to</span><span>  Wilcania,  while  paying  his  rent  into  the</span><span>  'Queensland  Treasury.  He  knows  the</span></p> <p><span>  value  of  the  western  lands,  and  became</span><span>  quite  enthusiastic  in  speaking  upon  their</span><span>  capacity  in  the  House.  And  he  an</span><span>  nounced  indetermination  to  vote  against</span></p> <p><span>  the  Government  because  he  had  no  faith</span></p> <p><span>  in  their  policy.  Sp  that  if  Mr.  Douglas,</span><span>  by  condemning  trunk  lines,  has  secured</span><span>  Messrs.  Beattie  and  Kingsford,  he  has</span><span>  lost  Mr.  Persse,  and  decided  »one  or  tw<></span><span>  other  hesitating  members  to  vote  with</span><span>  the  Opposition,  it  is  plainly.  seen  that</span><span>  .he  Ministers  are  driven  about  by  every</span><span>  w.ind  of  doctrine,  and  that  they  are  not</span></p> <p><span>  fit  lo  be  trusted  with  the  carrying  out  or</span><span>  a  great  public  works  policy.  On  the</span><span>  other  hand,  Mr.  M'lhvraith's  fitness  is</span></p> <p><span>  becoming  more  and  more  apparent,  and  j</span></p> <p><span>  even  his  opponents  are  obliged  to  admit</span><span>  that  he  is  the  kind  of  Premier  wanted  by</span><span>  the  colony,  but  assert  that  he  is  shut  out</span><span>  from  power  by  the  character  of  his</span><span>  political  associates.  This  kind  of  talk</span><span>  was  so  often  repeated  that  in  his  reply</span><span>  Mr.  M'liwrailh  distinctly  repudiated  it,</span><span>  and  refused  lo  accept  compliments</span><span>  at  the  expense  of  his  followers.</span><span>  And  no  impartial  person  will  deny</span><span>  that  in  this  he  has  taken  an  im-</span><span>  partial  course.  Whatever  his  followers</span><span>  may  be  they  are  loyal  to  him,  and  he</span><span>  would  be  ungrateful  to  allow  opponents</span><span>  to  flatter  him  that  they  might  discredit</span></p> <p><span>  them.  We  have  no  doubt  that  when  the</span></p> <p><span>  proper  time  comes,  Mr.  M'llwraith  will</span><span>  find  acceptable  colleagues,  and  that  there</span></p> <p><span>  is  as  much  patriotism  among  the  Oppo-  j</span><span>  sitionists  as  among  the  Ministerial  mem-</span></p> <p><span>  bers.</span></p> <p><span>  Persons  who  read  superficially  will  be</span><span>  puzzled  to  account  for  Mr.  Douglas'</span><span>  speech  after  seeing  that  his  Treasurer  is</span><span>  bringing  in  an  Estimate  of  ,£800,000  for</span><span>  trunk  lines.

Passengers'  lug-</span><span>  gage  and  coses  of  castor  oil  have  been  thrown</span><span>  ashore,  but  there  is  no  trace  of  the  passengers</span><span>  or  crew.  The  James  Service  was  from  Cal-</span><span>  cutta,  bound  to  Melbourne,  and  consigned  to</span><span>  Messrs.  Boyd  aud  Currie.  She  had  a  cargo</span><span>  consisting  of  1000  bales  of  sacks,  3000  cases  of</span><span>  castor  oil,  and  GOO  bales  of  jute.  '  The  pas-</span><span>  sengers  were  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Cowderoy,  Mr.  and</span><span>  Miss  Williams,  Mr.  P.  B.  Smith,  Mr.  W.  F.</span><span>  Phillips,  and  Mr.  J.  W.  Kelly.  Mrs.  Cowde</span><span>  roy's  maiden  name  was  Miss  Bessie  Edwards.</span><span>  She  was  a  sister  to  Ella  Carrington,  of  the</span><span>  Theatre  Royal,  Melbourne,  and  Miss  Williams</span><span>  was  a  soubrette  actress.  The  vessel  left  Cal-</span><span>  cutta  April  27,  and  put  into  Penang.  There,</span><span>  a  Board  of  Inquiry  was  held  and  a  new  captain</span><span>  shipped-Captain  Sievwright,  who  had  his</span><span>  wite  an  board.

Ho  is  prepared,  if</span><span>  necessary,  to  shoulder  his  musket  in  defence</span><span>  of  his  white  brethren  against  Chinese</span><span>  I  invasion,  and  he  went  BO  far  as  to  recommend</span></p> <p><span>  his  hearers  if  they  meet  a  Chinaman  on  the</span><span>  footpath  to  push  him  off.  Cheers  greeted  this</span><span>  statement,  instead  of  cries  of  shamo,  owing,  no</span><span>  doubt,  to  the  heated  and  excited  atmosphere</span><span>  of  a  public  meeting.  It  is  surely  unnecessary</span><span>  to  toll  Australian  working  men  that  they  will</span><span>  only  demean  themselves  by  discourtesy,  and</span><span>  much  more  by  violence.  Mr.  Cameron</span><span>  repudiated  Mr.  White's  advocacy  of  force,</span><span>  and  he  hod  the  good  sense  to  see  that  the</span><span>  question  must  be  treated  in  a  broad  political</span><span>  manner,  and  he  enters  into  an  agitation  on  the</span><span>  subject  with  earnestness  and  vigour.  Both</span><span>  these  speakers  wish  to  make  this  the  test</span><span>  question  at  the  nert  election.  Mr.  White's</span><span>  reasons  for  so  doing  are  very  obvious.  Mr.</span><span>  Cameron,  with  characteristic  penetration,  told</span><span>  '  his  hearers  that  all  the  candidates  would  say</span></p> <p><span>  they  were  opposed  to  the  Chinese  immigration.</span><span>  He  urged  them  not  to  be  content  with  mere</span><span>  assertion,  but  inquire  whether  the  candidate</span><span>  employed  Chinamen,  or  even  whether  hiB  wife</span><span>  purchased  her  cabbages  from  the  detested</span><span>  Mongolian.  Mr.  John  Davies,  it  is  needless</span><span>  to  soy,  is  quite  ready  to  support  Mr.  Cameron</span><span>  as  he  is  to  support  everybody  and  everything</span><span>  else.  It  is  not  likely  that  these  gentlemen</span><span>  will  bo  able  to  effect  a  total  exclusion  of</span><span>  Chinese  ;  and  on  the  cabbage  question  they</span><span>  will  find  most  powerful  feminine  influences</span><span>  against  them  ;  but  if  they  merely  ask  that</span><span>  Chinese  immigration  be  restricted,  they  will</span><span>  meet  with  very  general  support.</span></p> ",Article,1878-07-31,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  SEPTUM  BER  ll,  1678.</span></p> <p><span>  TURKEY  is  in  a  terrible  state  of  anarchy</span><span>  and  disorder.  It  is  only  a  few  days</span><span>  since  we  published  intelligence  that  a</span><span>  fresh  insurrectionary  movement  had</span><span>  broken  out  at  Trobigne,  in  Southern</span><span>  Herzegovina,  and  that  the  Mahommedan</span><span>  population  were  fighting  against  the</span><span>  Turkish  troops.  Our  telegrams  lo-day</span><span>  report  that  insurrection  has  also  broken</span><span>  out  in  Albania,  and  that  the  insurgents</span></p> <p><span>  have  massacred  Mehemct  Pasha</span><span>  and  a  number  of  oilier  Turkish</span></p> <p><span>  officials  at  Tpeka.  We  presume</span><span>  that  the  pasha  alluded  to  is  Mchemet</span><span>  Ali,  who  proved  himself  one  of  the  most</span><span>  able  of  the  Turkish  generals  in  thc  late</span><span>  war,  and  who  successfully  kept  in  check</span><span>  the  main  army  of  the  Russians  under</span><span>  the  Czarowitch  at  the  Jantra  Uiver,</span><span>  until  (owing,  as  it  is  believed  to</span><span>  intrigues)  he  was  superseded-  a  military</span></p> <p><span>  blunder  from  the  effects  of  which  thc</span><span>  Turkish  cauce  never  recovered.  Wc</span></p> <p><span>  published  a  telegram  yesterday  received</span><span>  by  the  Patriot,  which  stated  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  I  Sultan  had  been  deposed  ;  but  the  leport</span><span>  i  wants  confirmation,  and  as  nothing</span></p> <p><span>  is  said  in  thc  telegram  about</span><span>  his  successor,  we  are  inclined  to  thc</span><span>  opinion  that  the  story  is  not  true,  al-'</span><span>  though  in  the  present  state  of  Turkey</span><span>  an  event  of  the  kind  is  not  improbable.</span><span>  It  is  further  stated  that  the  Porte,</span><span>  under  pressure  of  circumstances,  has  at</span><span>  last  given  over  opposition  to  the  Austrian</span><span>  occupation  of  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,</span><span>  which  is  likely  to  be  permanent  ;  and  with</span><span>  the  large  force  at  Austria's  command,  it</span><span>  may  be  expected  that  those  provinces</span><span>  will  soon  be  reduced  to  a  state  o</span><span>  tranquillity.  It  is  probable  that  a  con-</span><span>  vention  will  now  be  concluded  between</span></p> <p><span>  Turkey  and  Austria.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Greek  frontier,  however,  is</span><span>  still  an  open  question.  It  will  be</span><span>  remembered  that  the  Congress  coun-</span><span>  selled  Turkey  to  peacefully  acquiscc</span><span>  in  the  claims  put  forward  for  an  exten-</span><span>  sion  of  territory  by  that  kingdom,  north-</span><span>  wards,  so  as  to  include  some  portion  o</span><span>  the  Greek  population  still  under  Turkish</span><span>  domination,  and  so  enlarge  the  Greek</span><span>  boundaries  as  to  reduce  the  expenses  of</span><span>  government  per  head  of  the  population,</span><span>  and  make  the  permanent  establishment</span><span>  of  that  kingdom  on  a  solid  basis  a  possi-</span><span>  bility.  Greece,  from  its  establishment</span><span>  as  a  separate  kingdom  in  1830,  under</span><span>  the  protection  of  Great  Britain,  France,</span><span>  and  Russia,  has  never  paid  its  way,  and</span><span>  the  interest  on  several  foreign  loans,</span><span>  some  of  which  were  wholly  or  partly</span><span>  I  guaranteed  by  the  protecting  Powers,  has</span></p> <p><span>  never  been  met,  but  has  fallen  as  a</span><span>  charge  upon  the  guaranteeing  Powers,</span><span>  who  are  now,  in  each  case,  heavy</span><span>  claimants  upon  the  Greek  Govern</span><span>  «rient.-in  reply  To""  ""remonstrances,</span><span>  that  Government  have  from  time</span><span>  to  time  pleaded  the  alleged  im-</span><span>  possibility  of  making  both  ends  meet</span><span>  without  a  considerable  enlargement  of</span><span>  territory  and  population.  The  entire</span><span>  kingdom  at  present  comprises  an  area  of</span><span>  not  more  than  20,000  square  miles,  with</span><span>  a  population  under  one  and  a-half</span><span>  millions.  The  desire  of  the  Greeks  to</span><span>  annex  the  Greek  provinces  to  thc  north-</span><span>  ward  is  therefore  very  natural,  and  it</span><span>  enlisted  the  sympathy  of  a  large</span><span>  majority  of  the  Plenipotentiaries  at  thc</span><span>  Congress,  especially  those  of  Great</span><span>  Britain  and  France,  whose  favourite</span><span>  policy  is  to  foster  the  development  ot</span><span>  Greece  with  a  view  to  provide  against</span><span>  the  growing  anarchy  consequent  upon</span><span>  the  decadence  of  the  Turkish  power,</span></p> <p><span>  and  at  the  same  time  to  raise  a  barrier</span></p> <p><span>  against  Russian  aggressiveness.  From</span><span>  considerations  of  this  kind,  Turkey  was</span></p> <p><span>  counselled  to  make  '  concessions</span></p> <p><span>  to  the  legitimate  aspirations  of  her</span><span>  young  rival,  but  the  counsel  was  given</span><span>  with  the  full  understanding  that  it  was</span></p> <p><span>  not  one  of  those  matters  which  the  Great</span><span>  Powers  would  not  bind  themselves  to</span><span>  enforce  by  means  of  armed  intervention.</span><span>  Since  the  Congress  broke  up,  the  pleni-</span><span>  potentiaries,  co-signitaiïes  of  the  Treaty</span><span>  of  Berlin,  have  made  a  joint  and</span><span>  decisive  appeal  to  Turkey  to  carry</span><span>  out,  without  delay  or  reservation,  the</span><span>  decisions  of  the  Congress  relative  to  the</span><span>  i  adjustment  of  differences  with  Greece  ;</span></p> <p><span>  j  and  the  last  we  hear  of  this  is  that</span></p> <p><span>  ;  Turkey  refuses  to  send  a  delegate  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  certification  of  the  Greek  frontiers</span></p> <p><span>  this,  we  presume,  being  the  Turkish</span><span>  reply  to  the  joint  remonstrance.</span><span>  Should  Turkey  persist  in  her  refusal,</span><span>  it  is  unlikely  to  lead  to  armed  inter-</span><span>  vention  by  other  Powers  ;  but  the</span><span>  action  of  the  Congress  has  pronounced</span><span>  the  Greek  claim  lo  be  a  just</span><span>  one,  and  has  formally  stamped  it</span><span>  with  the  approval  of  Europe.</span><span>  With  the  moral  prestige  thus  given  to</span><span>  her  cause,  the  little  Kingdom  of  Greece</span><span>  would  have  an  important  advantage  in</span><span>  the  event  of  its  going  to  war  with  Turkey</span><span>  -a  not  by  any  means  remote  contin-</span><span>  gency,  considering  the  weak  condition  to</span><span>  which  Turkey  has  been  reduced,  and  the</span><span>  chances  which  exist  of  Albania  (already</span><span>  in  revolt)  together  with  Thessaly  and</span><span>  Macedonia,  making  common  cause</span><span>  with  Greece.  It  will  therefore  bc  appa-</span><span>  rent  that  thc  insurrectionary  movement</span><span>  in  Albania,  which  is  reported  in  our</span><span>  European  telegrams  this  morning,  is  not</span><span>  improbably  fraught  with  consequences</span></p> <p><span>  of  a  momentous  character.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is,  perhaps,  satisfactory  that  thc</span><span>  Mahommedan  population  of  Batoum</span><span>  have  abandoned  the  idea  of  further  le</span></p> <p><span>  sistance  to  the  Russian  occupation  of</span><span>  that  port,  and  have  emigrated  to</span><span>  Trebizond,  rather  than  subject  them-</span></p> <p><span>  selves  to  Russian  rule.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Australian  Sb  trim-  uf  3lBt  ultimo,</span><span>  contains  an  excellent  portrait  of  thc  late  Hov.</span><span>  Dr.  Tellig;  also  portraits  nf  The  Bride  and</span><span>  Bridegroom  -  Miss  Robinson  and  Mr.  A.

Tlie  heavy  shower  on  Friday  even-</span><span>  ing  last  moistened  the  surface  soil,  and  the</span><span>  pretty  continuous  rain  of  thc  past  two  days</span><span>  will  therefore  be  fully  absorbed  by  the</span><span>  cultivated  lands.

No  unprejudiced  observer,  for</span><span>  instance,  could  have  asserted  that  much</span><span>  interest,  not  to  say  enthusiasm,  is  felt  for  the</span><span>  Slavonic  cause,  after  witnessing  tho  ceremony</span><span>  got  up  a  few  days  ago  by  thc  Slavonic  Com-</span><span>  mittee,  on  thc  (lay  of  tho  Slavonic  apostles,</span><span>  Cyril  and  Methodius.  There  were  barely</span><span>  thirty  persons  present,  and  thc  depression  of</span><span>  the  meeting  was  still  further  increased  by  the</span><span>  statement  of  the  prcsideut  of  thc  committee,</span><span>  Prince  WassiltehikofT,  that  lie  was  obliged,</span><span>  'for  various  reasons,'  to  resign.  This</span><span>  'Slavonic  demonstration'  has  afforded  much</span><span>  merriment  to  the  town,  and  Slavophilism,</span><span>  which  at  ono  time  threatened  to  become  a</span><span>  formidable  political  clement  in  l'ussia,  has</span><span>  now  become  a  laughing-stock.</span></p> <p><span>  PAITEIIISM  AND  DEFIIAVITI'  IN  Ml!l.milTl!NE.</span><span>  -Of  thc  lower  phases  of  society  in  Mel-</span><span>  bourne  some  notion  is  gaiucd  from  remarks  in</span><span>  Wednesday's  Telegraph.

Paujicrism  and</span><span>  depravity  invariably  go  hand  in  hand,  and  to</span><span>  make  children  bog  is  ta  educate  them  for  thc</span><span>  workhouse  or  the  gaol.

We  imagine  it</span><span>  would  not  be  very  dillicult  to  discover  it,  as  a</span><span>  little  investigation  would  probably  disclose  thc</span><span>  faet  that  the  unfortunate  children  ave  the</span></p> <p><span>  victims  of  parental  idleucss,  or  drunkenness.</span><span>  Great  hulking  loafers  ars  to  be  seen  in  Huurku</span><span>  strect,  docing  the  footsteps  of  their  children,</span><span>  watching  what  money  they  receive  for  (lowers,</span><span>  newspaper,  or  matches  ;  and  if  a  few  of  them</span><span>  were  pounced  upon  as  vagrant»  linville;  no  law-</span><span>  ful  visible  means  of  support,  thc  city  would</span><span>  soon  lie  cleared  of  thc  miserable  little  waifs</span><span>  who  now  nightly  infest  it.

This  gives  rise  to</span><span>  the  question-Why  this  diminution?  Surely</span><span>  a  plague  has  not  stricken  down  and  laid  the</span><span>  horses  and  bullocks  low  ;  no,  there  is  a  some-</span><span>  thing  else  at  work  other  than  disease.  Thc</span><span>  steam  horse  is  asserting  its  right,  and  when  it</span><span>  begins  to  show  itself,  there  will  traffic  turn,</span><span>  always  cager  to  bc  in  thc  front  rank.  The</span><span>  majority  of  the  teams  lately  engaged  upon</span><span>  tile  Broadsound  road  were  owned  by  a  strong</span><span>  finn,  who  has  gradually  worked  thom  off  to</span><span>  the  Railway  terminus.

There  aro  a  fow  carriers</span><span>  resident  at  this  port,  who  will  not  sacrifice</span><span>  their  homes  and  emigrate  to  pastures  new,</span><span>  being  still  of  opinion  that  thc  ship  having  so</span><span>  far  weathered  thc  storm,  J'B  not  ignominiously</span><span>  going  to  founder,  If  these  xtirh'i'x  intend  to</span><span>  compete  with  thc  iron  horse,  and  show  that</span><span>  they  can  delivcV  and  receive  their  goods  with</span><span>  at  least  equal  dispatch,  and  at  as  favourable</span><span>  rates  as  they  can  bc  obtained  via  tho  railway,</span><span>  then  thero  may  bo  some  chance  left  for  them  ;</span><span>  bot  it  appears  at  present,  these  Broadsound</span><span>  people  aro  throwing  dust  in  their  own  eyes,</span><span>  wilco  holding  out  for  exorbitant  rates  of</span><span>  carriage.  Broadsound  lias  its  advantages  for</span><span>  direct  shipments,  the  goods  being  less  liable</span><span>  to  damage,  as  they  pass  direct  from  tho</span><span>  ateftOM»r,  to  the  drays  or  waggons.

Some</span><span>  uncertainty  as  to  the  date  may  be  caused  by</span><span>  the  arrangements  for  a  dissolution  which  arc</span><span>  still  in  suspense.

Thc</span><span>  Chaucellor's  view  prevailed,  and  it  is  now  con-</span><span>  sidered  possible  that  Parliament  will  run  out</span><span>  its  term-namely,  two  sessions  more.  If  so,</span><span>  there  would  bc  no  dissolution  till  1SS0,  and</span><span>  next  year  may  bo  looked  forward  to  as  one  of</span></p> <p><span>  comparative  peace,  when  his  Royal  Highness  I</span><span>  might  bc  spared  for  nine  mouths.

The</span></p> <p><span>  article  I  have  already  alluded  to  in  thc  1</span><span>  Morning  /W  supports  it  warmly.

"<p><span>  CORRESPONDENCE.</span></p> <p><span>  NEGLECTED  CHILDREN.</span></p> <p><span>  TO  THE  EDITOR  OF  THE  MORNING  BULLETIN.</span></p> <p><span>  Sir,  -  The  cases  of  neglected and insubordi-</span><span>  nate  children,  recently  brought  up  before  our</span><span>  local  Court,  naturally  suggest  the  inquiry  as</span><span>  to  whether  some  provision  should  not  be  made</span><span>  to  check  the  growing  evil.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Industrial  Schools  Act  fully  pro-</span><span>  vides  for  the  meeting  of  these  cases  by</span><span>  special  institutions,  to  which  children  who  are</span><span>  not  getting  proper  care  and  schooling  can  be</span><span>  conveyed  by  Magistrate's  order,  and  the</span><span>  parents  obliged  to  contribute  to  their  support.</span><span>  There  are,  I  fear,  a  number  of  children  now</span><span>  growing  up  who  want  such  care  and  pro-  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  tection,  and  who,  as  time  goes  on,  will</span><span>  develop  into  candidates  for  reformatories.</span><span>  How  much  better  would  it  be  to  have  the</span><span>  evil  prevented  by  taking  such  in  hand  while</span><span>  still  young.  Some  of  us  at  the  foundation  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  our  present  Orphanage,  would  rather have</span><span>  seen  an  institution  with  wider  capabilities  in-</span><span>  stead,  having  the  benefit  of  the  provisions  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  above-mentioned  Act.  It  was  found  by</span><span>  those  practically  acquainted  with  the  state</span><span>  of  things  in  Rockhampton,  that  children  seek-</span><span>  ing  admission  into  the  Orphanage  were  of</span></p> <p><span>  much  the  same  class  as  those  who</span><span>  would  be  eligible  for  an  Industrial</span><span>  Home.  Some  few  exceptions  there  will  &nbsp;</span><span>  be,  but  the  thoughtful  mind  will  soon</span><span>  perceive  that,  as  drunkenness  and  im-</span><span>  providence  in  one  or  both  parents  usually  pro-</span><span>  duces  both  the  orphan  and  the  neglected  child,</span><span>  the  result  is  much  the  same  to  the  public,  as</span><span>  in  either  case  the  parent's  control  of his child</span><span>  is  gone.  Indeed  the  orphan,  as  we  now  stand,</span><span>  is  in  a  better  position  to  claim  kindness  and</span><span>  protection  than  the  neglected  child,  for  with-</span><span>  out  the  arm  of  the  law  none  can  step  in  be-</span><span>  tween  parent  and  child.</span></p> <p><span>  The  question  now  arises  ""How  many  more</span><span>  cases  of  larrikinism  and  ruined  character  are</span><span>  we  to  allow  to  grow  up,  before  the  Act  is</span><span>  brought  out  of  its  present almost dead letter</span><span>  form, and suitable training homes provided?""</span></p> <p><span>  Institutions  in  the  old  countries  are  givingway  &nbsp;</span><span>  to the  improved plan  of smaller  homes, and</span><span>  it  is  cheering  to  read  of  the  interest  taken  in</span><span>  these  by  some  of  the  nobility  and  gentry  of</span><span>  England,  and  those  whose  noble  deeds  agree</span><span>  with  their  position.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  DECEMBER  27,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  thc  Hospital,  on  thc  Hange,  thc  com-</span><span>  mendable  custom  of  providing  a  Christmas</span><span>  dinner  for  the  patients  was  adhered  to  on</span><span>  Wednesday,  and  there  was  a  truly  sumptuous</span><span>  spread,  including  beef,  mutton,  veal,  and</span><span>  sucking  pig  ;  besides  the  inevitable  plum</span><span>  padding,  and  other  viands  of  various  descrip-</span><span>  tions.

The  dining-room  nut</span><span>  ii  being  large  enough  without  uncomfortable</span></p> <p><span>  I  crowding,  the  table  was  extended  into  the</span></p> <p><span>  Ï  front  verandah.

Altogether</span><span>  thc  patients  seem  to  have  had  a  jolly  time  of</span><span>  it,  and  as  they  doubtless  kept  strictly  within</span><span>  Dr.  Campbell's  instructions,  we  «nay  hope</span><span>  that  none  but  the  most  happy  results  will</span></p> <p><span>  follow  from  the  feast.</span></p> <p><span>  Tim  sculling  match  between  Messrs.

A  good  start  was</span><span>  made  at  twenty  inimités  past  eight,  but  not-</span><span>  withstanding  Mnrkcrow's  steady  sweep,</span><span>  Butcher  rapidly  drew  .way  from  him,  and</span><span>  was  never  afterwards  called  on.  The  race</span><span>  occupied  twenty-one  minutes,  and  was  won  by</span><span>  nearly  half  a  mile  Mr.  \V.  Callaghan  neted  ns</span><span>  judge,  and  Mr.  W.

A  riïTrrioN  to  tho  Minister  for  Works  has</span><span>  'been  numerously  signed  hy  settlers  in  the</span><span>  Cawarral  district  as  well  as  hy  residents  at</span><span>  Rockhampton,  praying  that  the  publie  road</span><span>  past  Norton's  selection  may  bc  continued</span><span>  through  tho  valley  on  thc  north  side  of</span><span>  Cawarral  head-station,  as  that  road  would</span><span>  make  a  better  mid  more  direct  road  thau  the</span></p> <p><span>  present  one  through  that  station.

Tho  road  from  Rockhampton  via</span><span>  Lake's  Creek  to  Cawarral  rotation  is  generally</span><span>  very  good,  and  with  the  continuation  now</span><span>  asked  for  thc  facilities  fur  reaching  Binu  Park</span><span>  would  be  greatly  improved.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Royal  Illusionists  -  Messrs.  Thorn,</span><span>  Burton,  and  Jtarvin-gave  their  first  enter-</span><span>  tainment  last  night  to  a  crowded  house.  Mr.</span><span>  Thorn  occupied  thc  attention  of  the  house  for</span><span>  the  first  part  ot  tho  programme,  which  com-</span><span>  prised  many  sleight-of-hand  tricks  of  a  very</span><span>  wonderful  character.  We  have  not  space  to</span><span>  enumerate  them  all,  which  were  done  exceed-</span><span>  ingly  well  ;  but  ono  of  tho  card  tricks  may  be</span><span>  mentioned.  Mr,  Thorn  allowed  four  persons  of</span><span>  the  audience  to  chooso  from  tho  pack  a  card</span><span>  each,  and  having  collected  then)  he  shuffled</span><span>  them  amongst  the  others  and  placed  then»</span><span>  upon  th«  table.  He  then  procured  a  sword,</span><span>  and  taking  the  sards  in  his  left  hand  and  the</span><span>  sword  in  his  right,  throw  them  into  the</span><span>  air  and  as  they  were  falling  van  the</span><span>  sword  through  the  four  cards  which  hail  been</span><span>  chosen  by  ladles  and  gentlemen  in  the</span><span>  audience.  For  this  trick,  as  well  as  the  others,</span><span>  Mr.  Thorn  wasloudly  applauded.  Several  other</span><span>  tricks  followed,'  equally  mysterious,  among</span><span>  which  wasthcappcarancoof  Abdul  Mira  Khan,</span><span>  a  half  Turk,  tho  lower  part  of  his  body  being</span><span>  invisible.  But  by  far  tho  raoBt  astonishing</span><span>  part  of  thc  entertainment  was  the  cabinet</span><span>  so-called  spirit  euanco.  Messrs.  Darwin  and</span><span>  Burton  were  tied  to  chairs  with  long  ropes  by</span><span>  two  gentlemen  of  Hie  audience,  who  certainly</span><span>  could  not  complain  that  the  business  was</span><span>  carelessly  done.  The  so-called  mediums  were</span><span>  then  lifted  into  the  cabinet,  which  was  in-</span><span>  spected  by  several  gcntlonicii  with  thc  view  of</span><span>  showing  that  there  was  no  moans  of  external</span><span>  agency  beyond  the  view  of  thc  spectators.</span><span>  On  each  of  the  three  doors  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  were  closed  luudB  appeared  at  these  openings,</span><span>  and  the  knockings  all  over  the  cabinet  were</span><span>  energetic  enough  for  a  host  of  spirits.  Tho</span><span>  -  doors  were  openod,  and  the  mediums  were</span></p> <p><span>  seen  sitting  in  the  chairs  tied  as  usual.  Thc</span><span>  doors  were  again  closed,  tambourines  were</span><span>  thrown  in,  which,  were  immediately  played</span><span>  with  great  energy  and  afterwards  thrown</span><span>  out.  Again  the  doors  were  opened  and  the</span><span>  mediums  appeared  tied  as  nsnal.  Being  closed</span><span>  again  almost  immediately  two  coats  were</span><span>  thrown  out,  and  the  doors  being  opened  the</span><span>  mediums  were  seen  tied  as  before  in  the  choirs</span><span>  :  but  without  their  coats.  This  was  the  signal</span></p> <p><span>  for  thunders  of  applause.  The  doors  being</span><span>  closed  for  the  last  time,  the  chairs  and  the</span><span>  ropes  were  thrown  out,  the  sound  of  tarn</span><span>  lmurines  and  other  noises  continuing  the  while.</span><span>  When  the  doors  were  at  last  opened  Messrs.</span><span>  Burton  and  Darrin  were  standing  in  the</span><span>  cabinet,  which  was  empty  of  everything  but</span><span>  themselves.  Thc  entertainment  is  certainly</span><span>  one  of  the  cleverest  in  its  way  which  has  yet</span><span>  been  given  in  Rockhampton.  To-night,  a  new</span><span>  programme  with  more  astonishing  ""  spirit  ""</span><span>  manifestations,  is  to  lie  brought  forward.  A</span></p> <p><span>  ,1  ON  Tuesday  afternoon,  at  half-past  four,</span></p> <p><span>  .the  Mayor  and  the  local  agents  representing</span><span>  the  various  insurance  companies  met  Mr.  E.</span><span>  Macdonnell,  Chairman  of  the  Fire  Brigade</span><span>  Board  in  Brisbane,  for  the  purpose  of  express,</span><span>  ing  their  opinion  with  refercnoe  to  bringing</span><span>  the  Fire  Brigade  in  Rockhampton  under  the</span><span>  provisions  of  the  Act  of  1870  relating  to  thc</span><span>  snbject,  and  also  to  gain  from  Mr.  MacDon.</span><span>  nell  some  information  regarding  tho  working</span><span>  of  the  Act.  The  following  companies  were</span><span>  represented  :-Royal  (Mr.  W.  G.  Jackson)  ;</span><span>  City  Mutual  (Mr.  A.  E.  Alexander)  j  Queens-</span><span>  land  (Mr.  H.  L.

Mr.  Wake-</span><span>  field,  Superintendent  of  thc  Brigade,  was  also</span><span>  present.  The  Mayor  stated  tho  object  of  tho</span><span>  meeting,  and  requested  Mr.  MacDonnell  to</span><span>  give  them  tho  result  of  his  experience.  Mr.</span><span>  MacDonnell  »aid  it  was  only  through  the</span><span>  strong  interest  he  felt  in  the  snbject  that  he</span><span>  had  requested  the  gentlemen  present  to  meet</span><span>  bim,  and  he  disclaimed  acting  in  any  nffloial</span><span>  capacity.  The  bringing  tho  Fire  Brigade</span><span>  under  the  provisions  of  tho  Act  would  he  at-</span><span>  tended  hy  several  advantages,  and  thc  most</span><span>  important  of  these  was  tho  certainty  of  its  in-</span><span>  come,  which  was  {derived  from  contributions</span><span>  from  the  Municipal  Council,  tho  Government,</span><span>  and  the  Insurance  companies,  the  latter  having</span><span>  to  pay  a  rate  In  proportion  to  tho  business  tran-</span><span>  sacted  by  each.  Thc  public  was  not  called  on  to</span><span>  contribute  at  all,  except  through  the  Muni-</span><span>  cipal  Council  «nd  thc  Government,  and  thc</span><span>  insurance!  companies,  who  were  thc  most</span><span>  interested,  paid  a  share  of  thc  expense  in  pro-</span><span>  portion  to  their  risk.  The  financial  affairs  of</span><span>  thc  Brigade  were  conducted  hy  a  hoard  cou</span><span>  8ÍBting  of  three  members,  of  whom  the</span><span>  Mayor  was  a  member  by  right  of  office,  and</span><span>  the  others  were  nominated  by  thc  Govern-</span><span>  ment  mid  insurance  companies  respectively.</span><span>  With  regard  to  thc  rate  paid  hy  them,  2s.

From  his  ex-</span><span>  perience  of  thc  working  of  the  Brigade  in</span><span>  Brisbane  under  the  Act,  it  was  a  great  im-</span><span>  provement  on  the  previous  [system.

Th»  safest  distanoo  from</span></p> <p><span>  the  tres  is  that  which  is  equal  to  its  height.</span><span>  To  remain  further  away  is  to  place  onosolf  in</span><span>  the  same  condition  of  isolation  as  the  tree.</span><span>  When  thorc  are  many  trecB  together  their</span><span>  collective  conductivity  is  often  sufficient  to</span><span>  cause  an  indestrnctivo  discharge  of  electricity,</span><span>  especially  when  wet  with  rain,  but  then  their</span><span>  surfaces  are  covered  with  a  film  of  water,</span><span>  whisk  is  a  good  conductor.  Hence  danger</span><span>  from  lightning  is  much  less  after  rain  has</span><span>  begun  to  fall  than  when  everything  is  dry.</span><span>  Tlie  safest  situation  therefore  during  a</span><span>  thunderstorm  is  in  thc  midst  of  a  number  of</span><span>  trees,  but  particularly  avoid  the  neighbour-</span><span>  hood  of  thc  tallest  trees.  The  greatest  risk</span><span>  ^rom  lightning  is  incurred  l>y  persons</span><span>  travelling  over  a  wide  and  very  flat  plain  ;</span><span>  because  in  such  a  situation  they  are  thc  only</span><span>  elevated  cujéete.

An  additional  loan  of  ,£7000</span><span>  was  obtained  for  the  purpose  of  this  ex-</span><span>  tension,  and  certain  of  our  townsmen,</span><span>  who  are  impatiently  waiting  the  oppor-</span><span>  tunity  of  laying  on  the  water  to  their</span><span>  premises,  are  under  the  impression  that</span><span>  the  delay  in  thc  completion  of  this  useful</span><span>  work  is  owing  to  the  general  account  of</span><span>  the  Municipality  being  overdrawn  at  the</span><span>  Bank,  the  balance  to  credit  on  Water</span><span>  Supply  account  being  held  as  a  set  off</span><span>  against  the  overdraft  on  the  general</span><span>  account.  It  is  also  alleged  that  this</span><span>  arrangement  not  only  delays  the  water</span><span>  supply  being  made  generally  available,</span><span>  but  in  effect  charges  it  with  interest</span><span>  accruing  on  the  municipal  overdraft.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Rockhampton  Council  for  many</span><span>  years  scrupulously  distinguished  special</span></p> <p><span>  funds  from  the  General  Account  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Municipality-dating  from  the  time  when</span><span>  Mr.  Livermore  as  Mayor  straightened  the</span><span>  finances  and  caused  them  to  be  dealt</span><span>  with  in  a  business  manner;  and  we  should</span><span>  be  very  sorry  to  find  that  any  laxity  in</span><span>  the  matter  had  begun  to  manifest  itself.</span><span>  We  have  therefore  made  inquiries  into</span><span>  the  facts  of  the  case,  and  are  in  a  posi-</span><span>  tion  to  relieve  the  minds  of  those  of  our</span><span>  fellow-townsmen  who  have  been  troubled</span><span>  with  suspicions  of  irregularities  in  con-</span><span>  nection  with  thc  management  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  civic  funds.</span></p> <p><span>  The  loan  of  .£7000  to  complete  the</span><span>  water  supply  has,  it  seems,  already  been</span><span>  pledged  for  the  furtherance  of  its  legiti-</span><span>  mate  object.

The  order  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  pipes  was  sent  in  July,  arid  £i$oo  was</span><span>  remitted  last  month,  in  time  to  meet  the</span><span>  bills  of  lading  on  the  first  shipment.  A</span><span>  second  remittance  of  ¿1500  will  be</span></p> <p><span>  made  when  advice  is  received  that  the</span><span>  second  instalment  of  pipes  is  ready  for</span></p> <p><span>  shipment;  and  the  balance  of  ¿779,</span><span>  which  includes  freight  and  other  charges,</span><span>  will  be  paid  on  delivery  at  Rockhampton</span><span>  of  the  remainder  of  the  order.

Burns</span></p> <p><span>  and  Twigg,  for  the  supply  of  new  pumps</span><span>  for  the  the  old  engine,  and  this  contract</span><span>  which  is  near  completion,  and  will  have</span><span>  to  be  paid  for  within  a  few  weeks  of  pre-</span><span>  sent  date,  amounts  lo  about  .£750,</span><span>  There  will  also  be  the  cost  of  laying  the</span><span>  pipes,  and  with  this  item  added,  the</span><span>  whole  loan  of  £1000  to  Water  Supply</span><span>  is  disposed  of.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  also  to  be  observed  that  no  por-</span><span>  tion  of  this  money  has  been  kept  from</span><span>  its  proper  object  for  a  single  day.

We</span><span>  have  reason  to  believe  that,  as  a  rule,</span><span>  this  distinction  has  been  observed,  but</span><span>  there  has  probably  been  a  little  confusion</span><span>  in  reference  to  interest,  owing  to  circum-</span><span>  stances  such  as  we  have  just  referred  to.</span><span>  But  in  the  particular  case  under  notice,  il</span><span>  cannot  be  said  that  the  Water  Supply</span><span>  account  has  unjustly  suffered  loss.  We</span><span>  are  aware  that  a  sum  equal  to  the  over-</span><span>  draft  on  General  account  was  allowed  to</span><span>  remain  unproductive,  as  a  set  off  against</span><span>  said  overdraft,  whereas  it  might  other-</span><span>  wise  have  been  placed  at  interest  as  afixed</span><span>  deposit.  In  fact,  ,£2000  of  the  Water</span><span>  Supply  loan  was  so  dealt  with,  and  had</span><span>  the  General  account  not  fallen  in  arrear,</span><span>  it  is  probable  that  instead  of  £zooo</span><span>  only,  the  whole  of  the  .£7000  might  for</span><span>  a  short  period  have  been  earning  in-</span><span>  terest  at  fixed  deposit  rates.  Whatever</span><span>  amount  might  have  so  accrued</span><span>  to  the  Water  Supply  account,  is  there-</span><span>  fore  due  to  it  from  the  General  account.</span><span>  But,  on  the  other  hand,  we  find  that</span><span>  interest  amounting  to  about  .£750,  due</span><span>  on  Water  loan,  was  recently  stopped  by</span><span>  the  Government  out  of  the  rates</span><span>  endowment  due  to  the  Council,</span><span>  so  that  the  Water  account  is</span><span>  actually  in  debt  to  the  General</span><span>  account,  lt  is  also  to  be  stated  that  a</span><span>  considerable  sum  was  advanced  from  the</span><span>  General  funds  to  Water  account  when</span><span>  the  works  were  in  course  of  construction,</span><span>  and  although  those  advances  have  been</span><span>  repaid  there  was  no  consideration  for</span><span>  interest  on  thc  temporary  loan,  whilst</span><span>  the  Council  were  deprived  of  thc  usc  of</span><span>  the  money  on  General  account  during</span><span>  the  time  it  was  so  lent  But  the  receipt</span><span>  of  ^5000  from  tlie  Government  this</span><span>  week,  as  a  moiety  of  the  additional  loan</span><span>  promised  to  thc  Municipality  for  certain</span><span>  objects  of  a  general  character,  has</span><span>  cleared  off  the  overdraft,  and  thc  balance</span><span>  to  the  credit  of  Water  account  is  now</span><span>  under  no  lien  of  any  kind.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  no  idea  of  contending  that</span><span>  the  small  sum  which  has  indirectly</span><span>  i  been  paid  from  the  General  funds  towards</span><span>  I  the  cost  of  the  Water  Supply  has  inflicted</span></p> <p><span>  any  injustice  on  the  general  ratepayer.</span><span>  On  the  contrary,  we  consider  that  the</span><span>  Water  Supply  not  only  benefits  the</span><span>  properties  along  which  the  pipes  are</span><span>  laid,  but  the  town  as  a  «hole  derives</span><span>  important  advantages  from  it  as  one  of</span><span>  the  prime  necessaries  of  life.  It  is  also</span><span>  beneficial  in  other  ways-for  promoting</span><span>  cleanliness  and  sanitary  improvement,</span><span>  for  laying  dust  in  the  streets,  and  for  the'</span><span>  extinction  of  fires.  A  contribution</span><span>  towards  such  an  object  as  the  pro-</span><span>  vision  of  Water  Supply  might  there-</span><span>  fore  with  perfect  fairness  be  made</span><span>  from  the  general  funds-even  a</span><span>  considerable  portion  of  the  cost.  How-</span><span>  ever,  as  thc  interest  on  the  Water  loan  is</span><span>  met  by  a  special  rate  leviable  only  upon</span><span>  properties  directly  benefited  by  thc</span><span>  expenditure  of  the  loan,  it  is  obviously</span><span>  desirable  that  a  separate  fund  should  be</span><span>  kept,  and  that  care  should  be  taken  to</span><span>  prevent  the  different  accounts  of  the</span><span>  municipality  being  confused  one  with  the</span></p> <p><span>  other.  Indeed  the  new  Local  Govern-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  Act  distinctly  requires  that  the</span><span>  proceeds  ""f  loans  and  of  special  rates</span><span>  shall  be  kept  in  separate  accounts  to</span><span>  ensure  their  being  held  sacred  to  the</span><span>  specific  object  for  which  they  were</span><span>  respectively  intended.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  consoling  to  find  that  in  the</span><span>  Municipality  of  Rockhampton  this  whole-</span><span>  some  rule  of  keeping  distinct  accounts</span><span>  has  been  substantially  adhered  to  whilst</span><span>  no  law  existed  to  compel  its  observance,</span><span>  and  the  passing  of  the  new  Act  will  not</span><span>  therefore  require  our  Council  to  alter</span><span>  their  plans  in  this  respect.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court  yesterday,  a  wages  case</span><span>  in  which  neither  party  appeared  personally,</span><span>  wasadjourned  until  Friday  upon  theapplication</span><span>  of  Mr,  Milford;  who  appeared  for  thc  com-</span><span>  plainant.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Amateur  Dramatic  Club  connected</span><span>  with  the  Catholic  Total  Abstinence  Society</span><span>  will  give  their  monthly  entertainment  in  the</span><span>  Derby-street  School-room  this  evening.

There  were  but  few  electors</span><span>  present,  and  little  interest  was  evinced  in  thc</span><span>  proceedings  hy  the  public.</span></p> <p><span>  AATE  arc  informed  that  a  dinner  was  given  to</span><span>  Mr.  Fox,  M.L.A.,  in  Hatfield's  Commercial</span><span>  Hotel,  St.  LawTcucc,  on  tho  27th  ultimo.</span></p> <p><span>  Thc  principal  residents  of  thc  township  and</span><span>  immediate  district  assembled  in  strong  force,</span><span>  considering  the  short  notice  given,  owing  to</span><span>  Mr.  Fox's  necessarily  brief  stay.  Over</span><span>  twenty  gentlemen  were  present,  and  letters</span><span>  were  read  from  several  others  expressive  of</span><span>  cordiabty  and  regretting  their  inability  to</span><span>  attend.  The  dinner  was  one  of  the</span><span>  best  ever  held  in  thc  district,  and</span><span>  the  expressions  of  esteem  for  thc</span><span>  guest,  and  of  confidence  in  him  as</span><span>  their  Parliamentary  representative,  were  warm</span><span>  and  enthusiastic.  Mr.  Fox  certainly  had  good</span><span>  reason  lo  feel  gratified  at  thc  hearty  manner</span><span>  in  which  his  public  services  were  recognised,</span><span>  as  well  as  at  thc  general  desire  that  he  would</span><span>  come  forward  for  re-election.  Ho  did  not,  wu</span><span>  are  informed,  set  at  rest  all  doubts  as  lo  his</span><span>  future  candidature,  but  went  so  far  as  to</span><span>  say  that  he  would  endeavour,  if  possible,</span><span>  to  comply  willi  their  a-eijncst.  In</span><span>  thc  interests  of  his  constituents,  as  well  as</span><span>  of  thc  colony  generally,  he  wished  success  to</span><span>  the  party  with  which  he  had  been  identified</span><span>  during  his  rather  brief  political  career,  ami  bc</span><span>  hoped  to  be  able  again  lo  place  his  serviced</span><span>  at  their  disposal;  but  >m  that  point  they</span><span>  should  bear  fruin  bim  dcGnitelv,  &lt;m  an  early</span><span>  date.  Mr.  Fox  doubtless  feels  thc  duties  of</span><span>  a  member  with  residence  at  capital  during</span><span>  half  tho  year,  a  heavy  tax  on  his  time  ;  but  his</span><span>  retirement  would  be  a  cause  for  sincere  regret,</span></p> <p><span>  and  we  shall  in  the  meantime  assume  that  Kc</span><span>  will  stand  for  re-election.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  usual  monthly  meeting  of  the  Com-</span><span>  mittee  of  thc  Benevolent  Society  will  be  held</span><span>  at  thc  School  of  Arts  this  afternoon  at  the</span><span>  customary  hour.</span></p> <p><span>  Tm:  Confederate  Diorama  seems  to  be</span><span>  losing  little  of  its  interest,  to  judge  from  the</span><span>  large  attendance  which  again  assembled,  last</span><span>  night,  to  witness  it.  Lieutenant  Herman</span><span>  introduced  some  novelties  in  ventriloquism,</span><span>  and  received  thc  repeated  applause  of  the</span><span>  audience.  Miss  Spalding  won  the  gold  watch,</span></p> <p><span>  and  Mr.  Cahill  thc  tea  .Hid  coffee  cervice.</span></p> <p><span>  WK  observed  that  ii  notice  of  motion  by</span><span>  M  r.  Groom  is  set  doun  ou  thc  business  paper</span><span>  of  tho  legislative  Assembly  for  Thursday</span><span>  next,  for  a  grant  of  £1000  to  the  widow  of  the</span><span>  late  Kev.  Dr.  Lang,  as  a  testimony  of  his</span><span>  public  services  in  promoting  the  erection  of</span><span>  Queensland  into  a  separate  colony.  A  motion</span><span>  for  a  grant  of  £1000  to  the  worthy  Doctor</span><span>  himself  was  voted  in  the  Assembly  some  years</span><span>  ago,  but  he  resented  the  proposal  in  language</span><span>  more  forcililc  than  polite,  considering  the</span><span>  amount  ridiculously  small  as  an  acknowledg-</span><span>  ment  of  his  public  services  to  thc  colony,  and</span><span>  tlic  amount  was  accordingly  never  placed  on</span><span>  the  Estimates.  A  vote  to  the  widow  might,</span></p> <p><span>  however,  bc  made  with  good  grace,  and  we  j</span><span>  think  that  Mr.  Groom's  motion  should  receive</span></p> <p><span>  the  general  support  of  the  House.  j</span><span>  \/A  WEKTiNß  for  thc  election  of  three  Trustees!</span></p> <p><span>  iiy-tho  subscribers  to  the  proposod  Grammar</span><span>  School  in  Rockhampton  was  held  yesterday</span><span>  evening,  at  eight  o'clock,  in  the  School  of</span><span>  Arts.  The  meeting  was  well  attended,  and  a</span><span>  warm  interest  was  manifested  in  the  proceed-</span><span>  ings.  Mr.  J.  Macfarlane,  M.L.A.,  was  voted</span><span>  to  thc  chair,  and  having  read  tho  advertise-</span><span>  ment  convening  the  meeting,  stated  that  lie</span><span>  had  made  inquiries  as  to  thc  working  of  the</span><span>  Grammar  School  Act,  and  he  was  told  by  all</span><span>  conversant  with  the  working  of  the  other</span><span>  Grammar  Schools  in  thc  colony  that  to  make</span><span>  the  institution  a  success  sullicicnt  money</span><span>  Bhould  be  locally  subscribed  to  entitle  them</span></p> <p><span>  to  receive  an  annual  endowment  of</span></p> <p><span>  £1000.  Ii«  illustrated  thia  remark  by</span><span>  referring  to  thc  circumstances  of  the</span><span>  Toowoomba,  Ipswich,  and  Brisbane  Gram-</span><span>  mar  Schools,  having  received  information</span><span>  from  gentlemen  connected  with  each  of  those</span><span>  institutions.  With  regard  to  their  own  school,</span><span>  the  money  subscribed  at  present  would</span><span>  entitle  them  to  an  annual  endowment  of  £500,</span><span>  but  if  a  beginning  was  made  it  was  probable  a</span></p> <p><span>  further  sum  would  be  subscribed.  Mr.  L.</span><span>  Sandel  said  it  was  known  there  was  a</span><span>  deference  of  opiuian  as  to  the  best  site  for  the</span><span>  school,  and  it  might  be  well  if  thc  nominated</span><span>  candidates  expressed  their  views  on  thc  ques-</span><span>  tion.  Mr.  Livermore  said  he  was.  decidedly</span></p> <p><span>  in  favour  of  a  suburban  site.  Tho  school</span></p> <p><span>  could  not  be  successfully  conducted  with  a</span><span>  small  piece  of  ground.  They  must  look</span><span>  forward  to  having  two  schools,  one  for  girls  as</span><span>  well  as  one  for  boys,  and  they  could  not  get  a</span><span>  sufficient  area  of  play-ground  in  tho  town.</span></p> <p><span>  Thc  health  of  the  children  was  another  con-</span></p> <p><span>  sideration,  and  in  this  respect  a  suburban  site</span><span>  woujd  be  preferable.  They  should  not  look  at</span><span>  the  town  merely  as  it  is  now,  but  as  it  would</span><span>  he  teu  or  twenty  years  hence.  He  was  not</span><span>  wedded  to  the  Range,  but  he  certainly  favoured</span><span>  a  suburbau  site.  The  Kew  Mr.  Hay  said  he</span><span>  had  no  hesitation  in  stating  his  views.  Thc</span><span>  question  presented  itself  to  his  mind  both  in</span><span>  the  abstract  and  in  its  practical  bearings.  In</span><span>  the  abstract  he  was  decidedly  in  favour  of</span><span>  a  suburbau  site-the  top  of  the  Hange,  for</span><span>  instance  ;  but  on  the  whole  question  he  was</span><span>  not  clear  winch  site  would  be  best.  A  girls'</span><span>  school  could  not  bc  long  delayed,  and  they</span><span>  must  take  into  consideration  thc  question  of</span><span>  girls  travelling  a  long  distance.  He  would  not</span><span>  pledge  himself  to  support  any  particular  site,</span><span>  but  would  examine  thc  whole  question  care-</span><span>  fully  and  decide  which,  in  his  opinion,  was  thc</span><span>  best.  Dr.  Callaghan  would  not  pledge  him-</span><span>  self  to  either  site.  Mr.  Risien  said  he  was  in</span><span>  favour  of  the  original  site.  Mr.  fl.  B.  Shaw</span><span>  oxprcssed  himself  forcibly  in  favour  of  a</span><span>  town  site.  Mr.  J.  J.  Wood  said  he  agreed</span><span>  with  Mr.  Shaw,  and  was  in  favour  of  tho  town</span><span>  site.  Messrs.  W.  G.  Jackson  and  Stanley  (5.</span><span>  Hill  having  boen  appointed  scrutineers,  the</span><span>  following  gentlemen  were  chosen  :-Mr.  II.  W.</span><span>  Risien,  Rev.  A.  Hay,  and  Dr.  Callaghan,  the</span><span>  first  gentleman  obtaining  twenty-three  votes,</span></p> <p><span>  and  the  two  latter  nineteen  each.  The  Chair-</span></p> <p><span>  man  declared  these  gentlemen  duly  elected.</span><span>  On  the  suggestion  of  Mr.  J.  Ferguson,  and  on</span><span>  motions  moved  and  seconded  hy  various  gen-,</span><span>  tleinen,  thc  following  names  were  proposed  to</span><span>  be  submitted  to  the  Government  for  their  con-</span></p> <p><span>  sideration  in  appointing  the  remaining  four</span><span>  Trustees  :-Messrs.  .1.

Itain  is  thus  much</span><span>  wanted.  Another  effort  is  being  made  by  the</span><span>  diggers  to  get  possession  of  the  well  situated</span><span>  in  Small's  selection.  A  petition  for  this</span><span>  object  was  got  up  Boluc  time  ago,  and  pre-</span><span>  sented  to  the  Goldfields  Commissioner  (Mr.</span><span>  A.  Henry),  and  tho  arrangement  wliich</span><span>  followed  seemed  to  bc  a  final  settlement  of</span><span>  the  question.  Mr.  Small  retaiucl  the  well,</span><span>  but  gave  up  a  considerable  portion  of  water</span><span>  frontage  on  the  cerck,  and  was  allowed,  by  way</span><span>  (  of  compensation,  to  select  a  piece  of  land  else-</span><span>  where.  All  parties  seemed  satisfied  at  the</span><span>  time,  and  thc  arrangement  has  probably  hy</span><span>  this  time  been  ratified  by  the  authorities</span><span>  below.  In  addition  to  thc  line  of  front-</span><span>  age  on  thc  creek,  thc  diggers  have</span><span>  a  well  on  thc  reserve.  Opinion  is</span><span>  divided  as  to  the  permanent  character  of  the</span><span>  water  ;  but  one  mau  has  so  much  faith  in  it</span><span>  that  he  has  applied  for  a  water  right,  and</span><span>  means  to  sink  a  large  trench.  This  is  the</span><span>  history  of  the  case  so  far  ;  and  the  diggers,</span><span>  apparently  dissatisfied  with  their  bargain,</span><span>  have  again  petitioned  the  Goldfields  Commis-</span><span>  sioner  to  give  them  Mr.  Small's  well.  The</span><span>  petitioners,  numbering  71,  request  Mr.  Henry</span><span>  ""  to  mark  off  the  boundaries  of  this  goldfield</span><span>  so  as  to  include  thc  northern  portion  of</span><span>  laud  known  as  a  water  course  running  into</span><span>  Gowrie  Creek,  on  the  northern  boundary  of</span><span>  which  is  situated  a  well,  being  the  only  water</span><span>  supply  available  for  the  use  of  the  residents  of</span><span>  tins  goldfield.""  Thc  petitioners  further  state</span><span>  ""  thc  well  was  originally  sunk  by  miners  for</span><span>  gold-washing  purposes,  and  was  held  by  virtue</span><span>  of  a  water  right  by  William  Cunningham  and</span><span>  party  for  a  term  of  five  years.""

Bailen  and  work  of  a  similar</span><span>  description  are  ia  considerable  demand,  espe-</span><span>  cially  an  improved  water  cart,  containing  à</span><span>  circufax  .iron  tank,  capable  of  holding  from</span><span>  20Í)  to  -30O  gallons,  as  required.  Tho</span><span>  foundry;  department  is  very.  interesting  to</span><span>  a  stranger.  Only  a  day  or  two  ago  a</span><span>  four-ton  casting,  the  bed  for  tho  new</span><span>  pump,  was  completed.  When  it  is  recollected</span><span>  tliat  -  thia  quantity  of  iron  was  poured  in  a</span><span>  liquid  state  into  the  mould,  some  idea  may  be</span><span>  formed  of  the  appliances  at  the  command  of</span><span>  tho  shops.  The  melted  metal  is  poured  out</span><span>  ot  the  furnace  into  ladles  ol  various  sizes,</span><span>  capable  of  holding  from  four  tous  to  fifty</span><span>  pounds  weight.  Tho  variety  of  castings  made</span><span>  here  is  bewildering  to  the  unskilled  visitor,</span><span>  but  amongst  them  may  be  mentioned  plumber</span></p> <p><span>  blócks,:*Tráfer-p¡pe  connections,  twee  Irons,""</span><span>  bridge  girders,  and  winch  castings.  Of  course</span><span>  tho  same  appliances  are,  suitable  for  brass  and</span><span>  copper  castings,  which  arc  frequently  re-</span><span>  quired.  The  sand  in  .  the  foundry  floor</span><span>  is  upwards  of  six  feet  deep,  but  sometimes</span><span>  tlio  moulds  require  to  be  made  of  ground</span><span>  charcoal,  and  a  crushing  machine  is  employed</span><span>  which  reduces  it  as  fine  as  flour.  Connected</span><span>  with  the  foundry  is  a  stove  in  which  is  most</span><span>  carefully  dried  all  the  ""cores,""  otherwise</span><span>  moulds  of  sand  used  iu  making  pipes  and</span><span>  hollow  castings.  If  there  was  thc  least  mois-</span><span>  ture  the  melted  iron  would  convert  it  into</span><span>  steam,  which  would  explode  and  send  tho</span><span>  liquedironsplasliingabout  tile  workers  like  hot</span><span>  water  ;  therefore,  thc  utmost  care  is  necessary</span><span>  to  avoid  accidents.  Under  Mr.  Twigg's</span><span>  superintendence  is  the  pattern  shop,  where  thc</span><span>  shapes  of  all  the  castings  must  first  be  made</span><span>  in  wood.  Cedar  and  hoop-piuc  are  generally</span><span>  used  for  this  purpose.  Tho  patterns  are</span><span>  carefully  kept  after  they  arc  used,  for</span><span>  in  thc  course  of  years  they  may  bc  of</span><span>  service  again.  Thc  upper  story  of  a  large  build-</span><span>  ing  is  full  of  these  patterns,  which  comprise</span><span>  shapes  of  all  descriptions  of  machinery,  from</span><span>  thc  propeller  of  a  steamboat  to  thc  simplest</span><span>  cog-wheel.  An  interesting  ¡tom  of  the  con-</span><span>  tents  of  this  room  is  Iialf-a-ton  of  copper  in</span><span>  141b.  ingots,  bought  from  the  1'cak  Downs</span><span>  Company,  £2  a  ton  cheaper  than  that  ruling</span><span>  in  tho  English  market.  Thus  thc  mineral</span><span>  resources  of  thc  colony  aro  already  enabling</span><span>  manufacturers  to  compete  successfully  with</span><span>  imported  articlcB.  Mr.  Burns  assures  us  there</span><span>  is  iron  of  good  quality  in  the  Cawarral  district</span><span>  and  limestone  alsn.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  AUGUST  14,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  honorable  the  Attorney-General</span><span>  energetically  resents  thc  imputation  that</span><span>  the  Opposition  are  ruling  the  country.</span><span>  It  is  a  parrot  cry,  he  declares,  for  the</span><span>  bills  passed  this  session  show  less  alter-</span><span>  ation  than  almost  any  Government  mea-</span><span>  sures  within  Iiis  experience.  This  style</span><span>  of  defence  is  admittedly  courageous  ;  it</span><span>  evinces  a  lofty  disregard  of  notorious</span><span>  facts  ;  and  it  proves  that  there  is  at  least</span><span>  one  Minister  in  the  Cabinet  who  inherits</span></p> <p><span>  the  traditional  Englishman's  insensibility</span><span>  to  defeat.  The  only  measure  introduced</span><span>  this  session  which  could  be  treated  as  a</span><span>  party  question  was  the  Electoral  Dis-</span></p> <p><span>  tricts  Bill.  The  Local  Government  and</span></p> <p><span>  Lands  Resumption  Bills  were  in  no  sense</span></p> <p><span>  measures  that  could  excite  contention</span><span>  between  opposite  sides  of  the  House.</span><span>  The  only  other  item  on  the  Ministerial</span><span>  programme  calculated  to  excite  a  warm</span><span>  contest  was  the  Polynesian  Hill,  but  thc</span><span>  opponents  of  that  measure  were  found  on</span><span>  both  sides,  and  it  may  bc  doubled</span><span>  whether  the  Government  ever  had  any</span><span>  serious  intention  to  pass  it.  Lit  us</span></p> <p><span>  therefore  take  the  Electoral  Bill  as  a  test</span><span>  of  thc  truth  of  Mr.  Griffith's  .assertion.</span></p> <p><span>  That  bill  when  introduced  embodied</span><span>  two  striking  features.  It  affirmed  that</span><span>  thc  people  ol  Queensland  should  be</span><span>  represented  on  what  was  termed  the</span><span>  basis  of  m  Mn  population  ;  it  also  pro-</span><span>  vided  a  self-adjusting  scheme  by  which</span></p> <p><span>  to  the  end  of  all  time  redistributions  of</span></p> <p><span>  electorates  were  to  bc  carried  out  by</span><span>  Mr.  Speaker  without  legislative  interven-</span><span>  tion.  It  is  true  that  the  actual  redistri-</span><span>  bution  proposed  by  the  bill  did  nut</span></p> <p><span>  Start  on  the  basis  of  mean  population,</span><span>  but  strictly  on  that  of  adult  males,  that</span><span>  latter  having  been  the  basis  of  Mr.</span><span>  Palmer's  bill  of  1872,  and  the  basis  con-</span></p> <p><span>  tended  for  by  Opposition  speakers  ever  ¡</span></p> <p><span>  since  that  date.  The  Government  side,</span><span>  however,  then  all  contended  for  the  gross</span></p> <p><span>  population  basis,  and  avowedly  adopted  .</span><span>  the  mean  population  as  a  compromise.</span><span>  But  how  did  the  bill  emerge  from  Com-</span><span>  mittee  of  the  Whole  ?  The  self-adjusting</span><span>  clauses  which  formed  the  permanent</span><span>  portion  of  the  measure  had  been  excised</span><span>  in  their  entirety,  the  mean  population</span><span>  basis  was  no  longer  recognised  within</span><span>  its  four  corners,  and  thc  redistribution</span><span>  clause  was  materially  altered  by  lessening</span><span>  the  representative  power  of  the  metropolis</span><span>  and  by  augmenting  that  of  the  far-western</span><span>  interior.  Clauses  had  also  been  inserted</span><span>  at  the  dictation  of  the  Opposition  mem-</span><span>  bers  providing  for  the  preparation  of</span><span>  temporary  electoral  rolls.  The  bill  at  the</span><span>  third  reading  was  therefore  as  unlike  its</span><span>  original  self  as  anything  that  is  possible</span><span>  to  conceive  of;  and  seeing  that  it  had</span><span>  been  produced  ¿is  the  chief  Government</span><span>  measure  of  the  session,  and  that  as</span><span>  passed  it  embodied  the  well-known</span><span>  Opposition  policy  in  regard  to  electoral</span><span>  distribution,  the  contention  of  Mr.</span><span>  Griffith  verges  upon  the  sublime.</span></p> <p><span>  Again,  if  lhere  is  one  duty  more  than</span><span>  another  for  which  a  Ministry  must  be</span><span>  held  responsible,  that  duty  is  the  protec-</span><span>  tion  ol'the  public  Treasury.  Thc  Colonial</span><span>  Treasurer,  assisted  by  the  highly  paid</span><span>  experts  of  his  department,  prepares  his</span></p> <p><span>  annual  estimates  of  revenue  and  ex-</span><span>  penditure.  From  all  other  depart-</span><span>  ments  of  the  Government  he  obtains</span><span>  the  fullest  possible  information  as</span><span>  to  thc  prospects  ol  revenue  and  the</span><span>  necessities  of  the  country  in  regard  to</span><span>  expenditure.  Thus  seized  of  the  whole</span><span>  facts  of  thc  case  he  allocates  tile  funds</span><span>  prospectively  at  his  disposal,  and  then</span><span>  presents  to  the  Legislative  Assembly  a</span><span>  budget  exhibiting  a  small  nominal</span><span>  surplus.  Thc  presumption  is  that  the</span><span>  public  money  lias  been  judiciously  and</span><span>  fairly  apportioned.  Of  course  every</span><span>  member  cannot  be  satisfied  that  his  con-</span><span>  stituents  have  been  liberally  dealt  with,</span><span>  and  it  is  the  business  of  the  Opposition</span><span>  as  a  party  to  critically  scrutinize  every</span><span>  item  with  the  view  to  curtail  expenditure</span><span>  wherever  undue  provision  appears  to</span><span>  have  been  asked.  It  is  quite  open  to</span><span>  the  Minister  in  charge  of  an  estimate  to</span><span>  accept  suggestions  from  Opposition</span><span>  members  for  reducing  the  charges  upon</span><span>  the  people,  and  he  may  also  promise</span><span>  to  supply  omissions  by  placing  new  items</span><span>  on  the  supplementary  estimates.  He</span><span>  may  also  accept  defeat  when  the  majority</span><span>  determine  that  some  specific  appropria-</span><span>  tion  is  not  necessary.  But  he  is</span><span>  bound  to  resist  all  motions  from  private</span><span>  members  which  are  calculated  to  disturb</span><span>  the  equilibrium  of  the  budget,  and  it  is</span><span>  the  plain  duty  of  the  Government  when</span><span>  log-rolling  combinations  are  formed  to</span><span>  make  a  firm  stand  against  their  assaults</span><span>  upon  the  Treasury.  If  supporters  of  the</span><span>  Government  desert  them  in  order  to</span></p> <p><span>  join  in  the  assaults,  the  duty  of  Ministers</span><span>  is  clear.  Instead  of  pathetically  appeal-</span><span>  ing  to  the  House  for  protection,  they</span><span>  should  make  these  illegitimate  motions</span><span>  party  questions,  and  intimate  in  unmis-</span><span>  takeable  terms  their  determination  tc</span><span>  protect  their  own  estimates  and  the</span><span>  Treasury.  Robust  treatment  of  this  kind</span><span>  would  soon  put  a  stop  to  what  has  lately</span><span>  become  known  as  Thursday  evening's</span><span>  plundering.  But  the  present  Governmenl</span><span>  have  never  assumed  such  a  stand,  and</span><span>  Thursday's  sittings  have  become  chiefly</span><span>  noticeable  for  a  scries  of  Opposition</span><span>  triumphs  and  Ministerial  defeats  01</span><span>  retreats.  Whenever  the  Opposition</span><span>  consider  a  private  member  has</span><span>  made  out  a  claim,  they  vote  for  his</span><span>  motion  and  it  is  invariably  carried  ;  bul</span><span>  whenever  the  Opposition  join  in  resisting</span><span>  the  claims  of  Government  supporters  the</span><span>  motions  emanating  from  them  are  lost.</span><span>  The  result  of  the  present  session  in  this</span><span>  respect  is  that  unless  the  Treasurer's</span><span>  estimate  of  revenue  is  exceeded,  thc</span><span>  current  year  will  close  with  a  deficil</span><span>  instead  of  the  anticipated  surplus.  This</span></p> <p><span>  is  what  we  call  Government  of  thc</span></p> <p><span>  country  by  an  irresponsible  Opposition</span><span>  it  is  certainly  not  Government  by  thc</span><span>  responsible  Ministry  of  the  day.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  shown  that  in  their  leading</span><span>  measure  of  reform,  as  well  as  in  theil</span><span>  allocation  of  votes,  Ministers  have  beer</span><span>  unable  to  carry  their  proposals.  It  ii</span><span>  equally  easy  to  show  that  the  Govern</span><span>  ment  have  been  compelled  to  take  theil</span><span>  loan  policy  from  the  Opposition</span><span>  Starting  the  session  with  the  announce-</span><span>  ment  that  a  loan  was  not  required  this</span><span>  year,  the  Treasurer  was  afterward;</span><span>  forced  by  the  arguments  of  the  Opposi</span><span>  tion  leader  to  admit  that  a  small  loar</span><span>  would  be  required.  After  a  furthci</span><span>  interval,  the  hostile  ^3,000,000  loar</span><span>  motion  evoked  the  admission  that  i</span><span>  would  be  desirable  to  borrow  one-thirc</span><span>  of  that  sum.  At  the  same  time  lhrc&lt;</span><span>  Ministers  successively  affirmed  that  th&lt;</span><span>  policy  of  the  country  in  regard  to  rail</span><span>  way  construction  must  be  changed  ;  tba</span><span>  trunk  lines  must  bc  no  longer  carriec</span><span>  out  by  increasing  the  charge  upon  th&lt;</span><span>  funded  debt,  ami  that  future  loans  mus</span><span>  be  devoted  to  the  construction  of  brand</span><span>  railways.  This  was  a  definite  policy</span><span>  and  would  have  claimed  a  certain  amoun</span><span>  of  respect  if  consistently  adhered  to</span></p> <p><span>  But  what  was  the  character  of  theil</span><span>  loan  estimate?  Thc  Government  in</span><span>  definitely  postponed  their  new  loai</span><span>  policy,  and  asked  authority  to  borrov</span><span>  nearly  a  million  of  money  for  the  furthe</span><span>  extension  of  trunk  lines.  Thus,  whih</span><span>  pledging  their  faith  to  one  line  of  policy</span><span>  they  deliberately  adopted  a  diametrical!;</span><span>  opposite  one,  namely,  that  contended  fo</span><span>  by  thc  leader  of  thc  Opposition  and  hi</span><span>  party.  This,  too,  we  presume,  is  nba</span><span>  Mr.  Criliuh  calls  the  Government  oí  lin</span><span>  country  by  Ministers.</span></p> <p><span>  As  a  matter  or  Qct,  every  contestée</span><span>  question  of  importance  has  been  setllec</span><span>  in  accordance  willi  Opposition  demands</span><span>  Wt:  shall  continue  tu  bold,  therefore</span><span>  despile  thc  dictum  of  the  Attorney</span><span>  General,  that  duringthepresentieuiarkabl</span><span>  session  the  Opposition  have  been  rcall</span><span>  governing  the  country.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  JANUARY  25,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  IT  is  always  our  desire  to  strengthen  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  hands  of  public  officers  and  protect  them</span><span>  from  wanton  attacks.  But  the  best  of</span><span>  men  sometimes  make  mistakes,  and  we</span><span>  believe  one  has  lately  been  committed</span><span>  by  the  Engineer  of  Roads,  C.D.  We</span><span>  have  already  invited  public  attention  to</span><span>  the  matter,  without  effect  ;  but  represen-</span><span>  tations  have  since  reached  us  which  com-</span><span>  pel  another  reference  to  the  subject,  as</span><span>  it  bears  in  an  important  manner  upon</span><span>  the  question  of  internal  commu-</span><span>  nication.  We  allude  to  the  road</span><span>  that  is  being  opened  between  the</span><span>  Comet  railway  station  and  Spring-</span><span>  sure,  which  passes  through  a  great  deal  of</span><span>  bad  scrubby  country,  and  cannot</span><span>  be  utilised  until  a  traffic  bridge,</span></p> <p><span>  for  which  £1600  is  available,  has</span><span>  been  thrown  across  the  Comet  River.</span><span>  The  contention  of  many  well  informed</span><span>  persons  is  that  the  cost  of  the  bridge</span><span>  ought  to  have  been  saved,  and  that  a</span></p> <p><span>  road  should  be  cleared  from  the  Comet</span><span>  railway  station  to  the  Springsure  and</span><span>  Blackwater  road  where  it  passes  Comet</span><span>  Downs  head  station.  This  involves  the</span><span>  clearing  of  not  more  than  eighteen  or</span><span>  twenty  miles,  principally  of  lightly</span><span>  timbered  country,  and  the  distance  to</span><span>  Springsure  by  that  route  is  about  eight</span><span>  miles—certainly  not  above  ten—beyond</span><span>  the  so-called  direct  road  across  the  river.</span><span>  The  expense  of  opening  the  eighteen</span><span>  miles  of  road  would  not  have  exceeded</span></p> <p><span>  £150  to  £200,  and  it  would  have  served</span><span>  every  temporary  purpose.  The  proposed</span><span>  new  bridge  will,  in  fact,  be  almost  useless</span><span>  in  another  year,  because  there  is  every</span><span>  reason  to  believe  that  the  Comet  railway</span><span>  station  will  be  shifted  to  the  western</span><span>  side  of  the  river  so  soon  as  the railway</span><span>  bridge  is  completed  over  it.  As  it  is,  great</span><span>  doubt  is  expressed  whether  the  traffic</span><span>  bridge  will  be  ready  by  March,  in  which</span><span>  case  the  railway  station  will  be  unap-</span><span>  proachable  by  drays,  and  Blackwater</span><span>  will  still  remain  the  practical  terminus.</span><span>  If  the  station  remains  on  the  east  side</span><span>  of  the  river  another  traffic  bridge  will  be</span><span>  needed  for  the  Clermont  crossing,  or</span><span>  carriers  must  go  a  considerable  distance</span><span>  out  of  the  way  to  get  to  the  Springsure</span><span>  traffic  bridge.  There  is  no  doubt</span><span>  that  the  Springsure  people  are  entitled</span><span>  to  the  directest  possible  access  to</span><span>  the  railway,  but  if  the  station  be,—as</span><span>  almost  everyone  acquainted  with  the</span><span>  subject  is  satisfied  it  must,—removed  to</span><span>  the  western  side  of  the  river,  the  un-</span><span>  necessary  bridge  will  be  considerably</span><span>  out  of  the  direct  line.  The  road  from</span><span>  Comet  Downs  also  would  be  of  perma-</span><span>  nent  use  to  the  stations  in  that  neighbour-</span><span>  hood,  and  we  hope  it  is  not  yet  too  late</span><span>  to  open  up  the  track.  It  would  be  folly</span><span>  to  spend  £1600  to  £2000  on  a  bridge</span></p> <p><span>  that  will  be  useless  in  twelve  months.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  but  fair  to  Mr.  Jardine  to  say</span><span>  that  he  has  reported  fully  upon  the  rival</span><span>  routes  to  the  head  of  his  department,</span></p> <p><span>  and  that  the  road  of  his  choice  was  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  supported  by  a  petition  from  the  Spring-</span><span>  sure  people.  But  we  have  reason  to</span><span>  believe  that  Mr.  Jardine  was  furnished</span><span>  with  incorrect  figures,  which  led  him</span><span>  astray  in  making  a  comparison  of  the</span><span>  distances.  The  road  adopted  is  shown</span><span>  in  the  official  report  to  be  only  forty-</span><span>  seven  miles  in  length,  whereas  we  are  in-</span><span>  formed  that  through  deviations  from  the</span><span>  surveyed  line  it  will  be  fifty  miles.  On</span><span>  the  other  hand,  Mr.  Jardine  makes  the</span><span>  road  via  Comet  Downs  sixty-three  miles,</span><span>  whereas  it  is  declared  by  those  who</span><span>  know  the  country  to  not  ex-</span><span>  ceed  fifty-eight.  Pugh's  Almanac</span><span>  gives  the  distances  thus  :—Springsure</span><span>  to  Lagoons,  15  miles;  thence  to</span><span>  Burke's,  12  miles;  thence  to  Comet</span><span>  Downs,  12  miles  ;  total,  39  miles.</span><span>  Adding  19  miles  as  the  distance  from</span><span>  Comet  Downs  to  the  Comet  Railway</span><span>  Station,  the  entire  distance  from  Spring-</span><span>  sure  is  58  miles,  as  before  stated.  Now,</span><span>  between  Comet  Downs  and  Springsure</span><span>  the  river  is  crossed  by  a  low  level  bridge,</span><span>  which  serves  for  laden  drays  at  any  time</span><span>  except  in  high  floods.  It  is  alleged  that</span><span>  the  country  on  the  Comet  Downs  track</span><span>  is  scrubby  and  eaten  out,  but  so  is  a</span><span>  great  portion  of  the  new  track  via</span></p> <p><span>  Minerva  Creek.</span></p> <p><span>  It  may  be  admitted  that,  were  the</span><span>  present  Comet  station  the  permanent</span><span>  nearest  point  of  approach  from  Spring-</span><span>  sure,  £2000  would  be  well  spent  in</span><span>  building  a  traffic  bridge  over  the  river</span><span>  as  proposed.  But  seeing  that  the  present</span><span>  station  Comet  is  not  by  any  means  such</span><span>  nearest  point  on  the  railway  line,</span><span>  we  cannot  but  hold,  in  opposition  to</span><span>  official  opinion,  that  the  money  spent  on</span><span>  the  bridge  will  be  so  much  wasted.  It</span><span>  must  not  be  understood  that  we  set  up  a</span><span>  mere  editorial  or  unprofessional  opinion</span><span>  against  the  official  decision,  which  is  pre-</span><span>  sumedly  based  upon  surveys  and  personal</span><span>  examination  by  the  Engineer  for  Roads.</span><span>  For  we  have  facts  presented  to  us  by</span><span>  experienced  bushmen,  some  of  whom,  at</span><span>  least,  are  entirely  disinterested,  and  their</span><span>  testimony  unanimously  supports  the</span><span>  position  we  have  assumed.  We  regret</span><span>  the  difference  of  opinion  with  Mr.  Jardine,</span><span>  and  repeat  that  nothing  but  regard  for  the</span><span>  public  interest  would  have  impelled  us</span><span>  to  make  these  repeatedly  unfavourable</span><span>  references  to  his  action  in  the  matter.</span></p> <p><span>  EVERY  little  township  must  have  a  news-</span><span>  paper  ;  but  Port  Douglas,  which  has  just</span><span>  made  a  start,  is  ambitious,  and  is  going  to</span><span>  have  two.  The  Salisbury  Gazette  is  first  in  the</span><span>  field  ;  the  plant  has  reached  its  destination,</span><span>  and  the  paper  will  appear  forthwith.  Its</span><span>  competitor  will  be  the  Port  Douglas  Times,</span><span>  the  first  number  of  which  is  promised  for  the</span><span>  2nd  proximo.  The  proprietors  of  the  latter</span><span>  venture—both  known  in  Rockhampton—are</span><span>  Mr.  R.  H.  Pearce  and  Mr.  W.  M.  Welsh, the</span><span>  latter  being  a  printer.</span></p> <p><span>  A  SCRAP  of  news  comes  from  Mount</span><span>  Wheeler.  Messrs.  Davis,  Clements,  and</span><span>  Grey,  the  lucky  finders  of  the  rich  ""pocket""</span><span>  mentioned  the  other  day,  have  sent  a  trial</span><span>  crushing  from  their  claim  to  Mr.  Chalmers'</span><span>  machine  at  New  Zealand  Gully,  the  stone  con-</span><span>  sisting  of  quartz  and  tailings.  The  machine</span><span>  is  fully  eight  miles  from  Mount  Wheeler,  and</span><span>  the  item  of  carriage  alone  over  that  distance</span><span>  might  render  an  otherwise  payable  yield  un-</span><span>  remunerative,  The  object,  however,  is  merely</span><span>  to  test  the  ground,  and  the cartage, whatever it</span><span>  may  cost,  can  be  allowed  for.  A  claim  im-</span><span>  mediately  adjoining  that  of  Davis  and  party</span><span>  has  been  taken  up  by  a  miner  named  Lenden.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  regret  to  hear  that  there  is  a  probability</span><span>  of  the  forthcoming  boat  race  falling  through,</span><span>  The  teams  are  both  tired  with  natural  emu-</span><span>  lation  and  desire  to  seize  every  available</span><span>  opportunity  of  practising,  but  obstacles  are</span><span>  throw  n  in  their  way  by  members  of  the  club</span><span>  who  might  be  expected  to  give  the  athletes</span><span>  every  passible  encouragement.  On  Wednes-</span><span>  day  afternoon,  when  one  of  the  crews  went  to</span><span>  practise,  pursuant  to  arrangement,  they  found</span><span>  competitors  for  the  use  of  the  only  boat  avail-</span><span>  able,  and  these  declined  the  usual  courtesy  of</span><span>  giving  way  to  the  racing  crew.  This  circum-</span><span>  stance  has  given  rise  to  an  amount</span><span>  of  irritation  that  it  is  feared  will</span><span>  be  fatal  to  the  consummation  of  the</span><span>  race,  but  we  hope  means  will  be  adopted  to</span><span>  advert  such  a  misfortune  to  the  club.</span></p> <p><span>  Nothing  would  be  more  likely  to  popularise</span></p> <p><span>  the  Boat  Club  than  races  in  which  well-known</span></p> <p><span>  men  take  part,  and  we  trust  the  young  gentle-</span><span>  men  whose  conduct  gave  offence  on  Wednes-</span><span>  day  will  have  too  much  good  sense  to  repeat</span></p> <p><span>  it.</span></p> <p><span>  ON  Tuesday  last  the  Police  Magistrate  gave</span><span>  judgment  in  the  matter  of  Brooks  v.  West-</span><span>  head,  a  case  in  which  the  decision  had  been</span><span>  reserved  from  the  last  sittings  of  the  Petty</span><span>  Debts  Court.  Mr.  Mackay  (from  Messrs.  Rees</span><span>  R.  Jones  and  Brown's  office)  appeared  for  the</span><span>  plaintiff;  and  Mr.  Melbourne  for  the  defen-</span><span>  dant.  The  plaintiff  claimed  £4  0s.  6d.,</span><span>  balance  due  on  purchase  money  of  a  horse.</span><span>  The  defendant  paid  fivepence  into  court,  and</span><span>  pleaded  a  set-off  on  the  whole  account.  The</span><span>  dispute  between  the  parties  was  simply  with</span><span>  regard  to  the  first  item  in  the  set-off,</span><span>  amounting  to  £3  15s.,  and  also  to  5s.  cash</span><span>  paid,  which  the  plaintiff  did  not  acknowledge.</span><span>  The  item  of  £3  15s,  was  for  money  alleged to</span><span>  have  been  paid  by  defendant  on  behalf  of</span><span>  plaintiff  in  June,  1874,  for  the  repair  of  a cart</span><span>  belonging  to  defendant,  which  had  been</span><span>  damaged  by  the  alleged  careless  driving  of</span><span>  plaintiff,  to  whom  it  had  been  lent.  Mr.</span><span>  Mackay  claimed  that  the  set-off  was  barred  by  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  statute,  being  over  the  limit  of  three</span><span>  years  ;  Mr.  Melbourne  maintained  that  the</span><span>  limitation  did  not  bar  claims  by  way  of  a</span><span>  set-off,  though  it  would  not  permit  of  a</span><span>  plaintiff  prosecuting  a  claim  over  three  years</span><span>  old.  In  giving  judgment  on  Tuesday,  the</span><span>  Police  Magistrate  held  that,  in  his  opinion,  a</span><span>  defendant  was  just  as  much  barred  from  pre-</span><span>  ferring  a  counter-claim  beyond  the  limits</span><span>  prescribed  by  the  Small  Debts  Act,  as  a</span><span>  plaintiff  was  from  preferring  an  ordinary  claim</span><span>  beyond  those  limits  ;  and  he  should  disallow</span><span>  the  set-off  of  £3  15s.  accordingly.  His</span><span>  Worship  added  that,  oven  if  he  had  not</span><span>  arrived  at  that  conclusion,  be  should  have</span><span>  struck  out  the  counter-claim  for  other  reasons.</span><span>  The  evidence  was  most  conflicting  as  to  the</span><span>  damage  done  to  the  cart,  and  was,  on  the</span><span>  whole,  in  favour  of  plaintiff;  and  it  was</span><span>  significant  that  defendant  had  never  preferred</span><span>  this  claim  for  repairs  against  plaintiff  until</span><span>  about  two  months  ago,  although  the  former</span><span>  had  been  paying  for  the  horse  by  instalments</span><span>  up  to  the  end  of  July  last.  The  verdict  would</span><span>  therefore  be  for  the  plaintiff,  for  £3  15s.  5d.,</span><span>  (giving  the  defendant  the  benefit  of  the  5s.)</span><span>  with  costs  of  court  and  witnesses,  amounting</span><span>  to  £1  1s.  On  the  application  of  Mr.  Mel-</span><span>  bourne,  the  defendant  was  allowed  to  pay  the</span><span>  amount  by  monthly  instalments  of  £1,  the</span><span>  first  to  be  paid  forthwith.</span></p> <p><span>  BEFORE  the  Police  Magistrate  one  drunkard</span><span>  was  admonished  and  discharged.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Fitzroy  Lodge  of  Good  Templars  meet</span><span>  this  evening  at  the  Oddfellows'  Hall,  at  a</span><span>  quarter  to  eight  o'clock.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  sale  of  Dr.  Thon's  furniture  and</span><span>  effects  commences  this  day  at  eleven,  Mr.</span><span>  Curtis  being  the  auctioneer.  There  are  many</span><span>  valuable  articles,  including  a  piano,  buggy,</span><span>  drawing-room  suite,  library,  &c.—ADVT.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  were  informed  last  evening  at  the  Tele-</span><span>  graph  Office  that  the  overland  line  (or  cable)</span><span>  was  again  interrupted  yesterday  afternoon.</span><span>  The  presumption  is  that  something  of  un-</span><span>  common  interest  has  or  is  about  to  happen  in</span><span>  Europe.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  WE  hear  that  on  Tuesday  night  a  tornado</span><span>  visited  Emu  Park,  taking  the  roof  off  Mr.</span><span>  Fulton's  hotel,  and  smashing  up  the  furniture</span><span>  in  a  frightful  manner  ;  but,  strange  to  say,</span><span>  doing  not  the  slightest  damage  to  Mrs.  Pear-</span><span>  son's  house,  which  is  situated  within  a  hun-</span><span>  dred  yards  of  Fulton's.</span></p> <p><span>  A  MEETING  of  the  Committee  of  the  Fitzroy</span><span>  Pastoral  Society  takes  place  this  afternoon,  at</span><span>  four  o'clock,  at  the  Council  Chambers,  the  busi-</span><span>  ness  being  the  preparation  of  the prize schedule</span><span>  for  the  ensuing  show.  The  Central Queensland</span><span>  Graziers'  and  Fanners'  Society  hold  their</span><span>  quarterly  meeting  on  Saturday  (to-morrow)</span><span>  afternoon,  at  2.30,  at  the  Normanby  Hotel,</span><span>  the  business  in  this  case  being  also  the  arrange-</span><span>  ment  of  the  prize  schedule  for  the  next  show.</span></p> <p><span>  MR.  DUSTER'S  numerous  patrons  will  be</span><span>  pleased  to  learn  that  the  Turkish  Bath  will  be</span><span>  re-opened  in  a  fortnight.  The  new  premises</span><span>  will  be  much  more  convenient  for  the  purpose</span><span>  than  those  which  they  supersede.  On  visiting</span><span>  the  place  yesterday,  we  found  the  brick-work</span><span>  finished,  the  roof  on  and  ceiled,  and  the</span><span>  plasterers  nearly  done  with  the  walls  on  the</span><span>  upper  floor.  The  flooring,  staircases,  and</span><span>  other  wood-work  will  be  taken  in  hand  after</span><span>  the  plastering  and  colouring  are  at  an  end,</span><span>  and  every  effort  is  being  made  to  get  the</span><span>  bathing  portion  of  the  establishment  ready.</span><span>  A  brick  partition  runs  through  the  building</span><span>  longitudinally,  thus  adding  to  the  security</span><span>  and  privacy  of  the  rooms.  The  dressing</span><span>  room  will  be  down-stairs  to  the  left,  and  out</span><span>  of  it  the  bathers  go  into  the  champooing  and</span><span>  hot  rooms.  The  cooling  room  will  be  up-stairs,</span><span>  in  the  old  site  ;  but  the  new  one  will  be</span><span>  broader  than  its  predecessor,  besides  having  a</span><span>  window  at  each  end,  as  well  as  the  usual</span><span>  number  of  casements  in  front.  The  bathing</span><span>  portion  of  the  establishment  will  now  be</span><span>  quite  distinct  from  the  other,  and  we  see  that</span><span>  Mr.  Duster  is  preparing  to  add  a  new  ap-</span><span>  pliance,  viz.,  a  sulphur  bath,  which  is  some</span></p> <p><span>  times  used  for  colds.  It  will  be  kept  in  a</span><span>  room  by  itself,  and  will  not  interfere  with</span><span>  the  other  arrangements.  Altogether,  our  new</span><span>  Turkish  Bath  promises  to  surpass  any  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  colonies—but  we  shall  see.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  central  and  northern  districts  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  colony  will  ere  long  be  tolerably  well  supplied</span><span>  with  gaol  accommodation.  The  Townsville</span><span>  Gaol,  as  will  be  seen  from  an  extract  in</span><span>  another  column,  is  approaching  completion.</span><span>  It  is  designed  to  tap  the  north,  and  it  will</span><span>  curtail  the  pleasant  trips  prisoners  now  make  &nbsp;</span><span>  by  steamer,  both  before  and  after  sentence.</span><span>  There  will  be  thus  a  saving  under  this  head  ;</span><span>  besides,  a  separate  gaol  establishment,  though</span><span>  a  costly  affair,  was  needed,  as  the  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  Gaol  is  generally  overcrowded.  The</span><span>  erection  of  our  own  now  penal establishment has</span><span>  been  commenced.  The  concrete  foundations</span></p> <p><span>  have  been  laid,  and  a  course  of  masonry,  one</span><span>  foot  in  depth,  to  cover  the  concrete,  and  form</span><span>  the  foundation  of  the  brickwork,  is  in  progress.</span><span>  The  best  Stanwell  stone  is  used,  and  contrasts</span><span>  favourably  with  the  soft  stuff  to  be  met  with</span><span>  from  the  same  neighbourhood.  A  number  of</span><span>  hands  are  employed  in  dressing  and</span><span>  building.  Meanwhile,  the  contractor  (Mr.</span><span>  J.  Ferguson)  is  accumulating  the  neces-</span><span>  sary  material  for  the  superstructure.</span><span>  There  are  now  about  200,000  bricks  on  the</span><span>  ground,  and  by  the  1st  of  March,  when  the</span><span>  bricklayers  will  be  set  to  work,  another</span><span>  100,000  will  have  been  delivered.  This  will</span><span>  be  about  half  the  quantity  required  for  the</span><span>  work.  The  object  is  to  get  enough  building</span><span>  material  on  the  ground  at  first,  so  that  the</span><span>  bricklayers  may  be  kept  going  when  once  they</span><span>  have  made  a  start.  The  bricks  are  supplied</span><span>  from  three  local  brickyards,  where  work  goes</span><span>  on  incessantly.</span></p> ",Article,1878-01-25,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  FEBRUARY  8,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  despatches  received  by  Sir  George</span><span>  Bowen  appear  to  have  been  placed  to</span><span>  the  credit  of  the  Berry  party.  And  there  &nbsp;</span><span>  is  no  doubt  but  that  they  do  not  support  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  high-handed  course  taken  by  the</span><span>  Council.  It  must  be  recollected,  how-</span><span>  ever,  that  the  despatches  cannot  be  &nbsp;</span><span>  dated  later  than  the  21st  December,  and</span><span>  that  all  the  facts  could  not  possibly  have  &nbsp;</span><span>  been  before  Lord  Carnarvon  when  he</span><span>  wrote.  The  Conservative  party  in  &nbsp;</span><span>  Victoria  will  be  bitterly  disappointed  at  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  Imperial  approval  being  given  to  the</span><span>  inclusion  of  the  Payment  of  Members</span><span>  item  in  the  Appropriation  Bill.  But  as  the</span><span>  facts  were  placed  before  her  Majesty's</span><span>  Crown  Law  officers—for  no  doubt</span><span>  the  Secretary  of  State  wrote  under  their</span><span>  advice—we  should  have  been  surprised</span><span>  had  the  decision  been  otherwise.</span><span>  It  must  be  recollected  that</span><span>  payment  of  members  had  been  authorised</span><span>  by  statute,  had  been  practised  for  six</span><span>  years,  and  had  never  been  abolished  by</span><span>  legislation.  It  was  true  that  the  Act</span><span>  expired  at  the  end  of  the  first  session  of</span><span>  the  existing  Parliament,  but  it  was  &nbsp;</span><span>  actually  the  law  of  the  land  when  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  Governor  sent  down  his  message  &nbsp;</span><span>  recommending  that  the  vote  be  placed  &nbsp;</span><span>  on  the  Estimates.  How  were  the  Crown  &nbsp;</span><span>  Law  officers  to  know  that  Parliament</span><span>  would  not  revive  the  Act  before  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  money  was  actually  drawn?  The  repre-  &nbsp;</span><span>  sentative  chamber  has  an  absolute  right</span><span>  to  vote  any  money  it  chooses  for  a</span><span>  lawful  purpose.  And  even  if  the  Payment  &nbsp;</span><span>  of  Members  Act  was  about  to  expire,  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  Legislative  Council  had  no  right  to</span></p> <p><span>  assume  that  the  vote  would  be  unlaw-</span><span>  fully  spent.  That  was  a  responsibility</span><span>  that  lay  with  the  Cabinet,  as  a  body  &nbsp;</span><span>  responsible  to  the  representative  House,  &nbsp;</span><span>  which  in  turn  was  responsible  to  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  constituencies.  Besides,  if  Ministers  &nbsp;</span><span>  paid  and  members  drew  stipends  con-  &nbsp;</span><span>  trary  to  law,  they  might  be  got  at  through  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  Supreme  Court,  under  the  Constitu-  &nbsp;</span><span>  tion  or  Legislative  Assembly  Acts.  In</span><span>  so  far,  therefore,  as  the  Governor's  action</span><span>  in  the  sending  down  a  message  recom-</span><span>  mending  the  appropriation  of  an  amount</span><span>  for  payment  of  members  is  concerned,</span><span>  there  can  be  no  reasonable  doubt  that</span></p> <p><span>  the  Governor  did  his  simple  duty.  Had</span><span>  he  sent  down  the  message  subsequently</span><span>  to  the  laying  aside  of  the  Payment  of</span><span>  Members  Bill,  the  Legislative  Council's</span><span>  case  might  have  been  strengthened,  but  &nbsp;</span><span>  even  then  we  fail  to  see  that  it  was  his  &nbsp;</span><span>  Excellency's  duty  to  forecast  the  action</span><span>  of  the  Legislature  by  assuming  that  the</span><span>  bill  would  not  be  re-passed.  And  there</span><span>  is  the  more  force  in  this  consideration  &nbsp;</span><span>  when  it  is  recollected  that  the  Council</span></p> <p><span>  did  not  negative  the  bill,  but  merely  laid</span></p> <p><span>  it  aside.</span></p> <p><span>  But  because  up  to  the  21st  December</span><span>  Lord  Carnarvon  approved  of  the  course</span><span>  taken  by  the  Governor,  it  does  not  follow  &nbsp;</span><span>  that  he  will  also  endorse  the  proceeding</span><span>  which  resulted  in  the  coup  d'etat.  So</span><span>  astute  a  politician  as  Sir  George  Bowen</span></p> <p><span>  could  not  possibly  have  been deceived</span><span>  by  the  pretence  that  the  wholesale</span><span>  dismissals  of  public  servants  was  a</span><span>  measure  of  economy.  And  even  if  at</span><span>  first  he  were  under  such  a  misappre-</span><span>  hension,  Mr.  Berry's  Geelong  speech  &nbsp;</span><span>  must  have  undeceived  him.  After  de-  &nbsp;</span><span>  fending  the  dismissals,  and  arguing  that  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  amount  of  compensation  to  be  paid  &nbsp;</span><span>  to  officers  dispensed  with  proved  that</span><span>  they  had  suffered  no  hardship,  Mr.</span><span>  Berry  used  these  remarkable  words  :—  &nbsp;</span><span>  ""  Even  apart  from  the  amounts  of  com-</span><span>  pensation  I  have  read  to  you,  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  Government  would  be  glad  if  to-morrow  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  they  could  be  in  a  position  to  say  this  &nbsp;</span><span>  matter  is  ended,  to  restore  to  office</span><span>  those  absolutely  necessary  to  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  public  service,  and  enable  things  to</span><span>  go  on  satisfactorily.""  What  is  this</span><span>  but  a  confession,  that  economy  was  not</span></p> <p><span>  the  ruling  motive  for  the  dismissals  ?  But</span><span>  the  Governor  cannot  plead  ignorance  of</span></p> <p><span>  what  the  real  motive  of  his  Ministers</span><span>  was.  He  had  only  to  refer  to  their  &nbsp;</span><span>  public  speeches,  and  read  the  avowal  in   </span><span>  their  own  organ  that  the  dismissals  were  &nbsp;</span><span>  revolutionary,  and  an  outcome  of  a  coup</span><span>  d'etat.  This  was  stated authoritatively</span><span>  by  The  Age,  and  it  was  never  con-  &nbsp;</span><span>  tradicted.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  The  question  before  Lord  Carnarvon</span><span>  now,  therefore,  is  whether  the  Queen's</span></p> <p><span>  representative  was  justified  in  giving  the</span><span>  royal  sanction  to  a  breach  of  the  law  and</span><span>  an  infringement  upon  the  constitution,  &nbsp;</span><span>  or,  as  The  Age  puts  it,  to  a  revolutionary  &nbsp;</span><span>  act—a  coup  d'etat.  The  Governor  is</span><span>  undoubtedly  bound  to  follow  the  lawful  &nbsp;</span><span>  advice  of  his  responsible  advisers,  but  &nbsp;</span><span>  Lord  Carnarvon  will  certainly  not  ap-</span><span>  prove  of  his  following  advice  which  is  &nbsp;</span><span>  confessedly  reckless,  unlawful,  and  revo-  &nbsp;</span><span>  lutionary.  Mr.  Berry,  however,  evidently  &nbsp;</span><span>  presumes  that  he  has  the  Secretary  of</span><span>  State  as  well  as  Sir  George  Bowen  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  majority  of  the  electors  on  his  side,  &nbsp;</span><span>  and  hence  he  now  proposes  to  pay  away</span><span>  the  public  moneys  on  a  resolution  of  the</span><span>  Assembly  alone.  Well,  we  are  not</span><span>  acquainted  with  the  precise  terms  of  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  Audit  Act  of  Victoria,  and  therefore  &nbsp;</span><span>  cannot  pronounce  decisively  upon  the</span><span>  question  ;  but  unless  such  payment  be  &nbsp;</span><span>  expressly  prohibited  by  that  Act,  we</span><span>  think  Mr.  Berry's  contention in this respect</span><span>  affirms  a  sound  principle.  The  manage-  &nbsp;</span><span>  ment  of  the  public  finances  constitu-  &nbsp;</span><span>  tionally  rests  with  the  Legislative</span><span>  Assembly  alone,  and  unless  that  body  &nbsp;</span><span>  has  surrendered  such  right  by  sanctioning  &nbsp;</span><span>  an  express  statutory  prohibition,  we  &nbsp;</span><span>  cannot  blame  Mr.  Berry  for  resolving  to</span><span>  exercise  it  apart  from  the  Council.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  We  also  approve  cordially  of  the  pro-  &nbsp;</span><span>  posal  to  abolish  the  elective  Upper</span><span>  House.  The  present  constitution  has  &nbsp;</span><span>  repeatedly  proved  unworkable,  and  men</span><span>  of  all  parties  have  affirmed  the  necessity  &nbsp;</span><span>  for  its  radical  amendment.  The  desidera-  &nbsp;</span><span>  tum  is  a  safety  valve,  and  we  fail  to  see</span><span>  how  it  can  be  provided  with  an  elective</span><span>  Upper  House,  unless  that  chamber  were</span><span>  elected  by  universal  suffrage  and  could</span><span>  be  dissolved  by  the  advice  of  Ministers.</span><span>  But  if  so  elected  it  would  no  longer  be  a</span><span>  Conservative  chamber,  but  a  weak  reflex</span><span>  of  the  Lower  House,  equally  impotent  for</span><span>  good  or  evil.  Nor  would  Mr.  Francis'</span><span>  old  scheme  for  averting  deadlocks  operate</span><span>  satisfactorily.  The  Norwegian  system  &nbsp;</span><span>  may  do  very  well  in  Norway,  but  it  &nbsp;</span><span>  would  be  a  farce  in  Victoria.  The  plan</span><span>  adopted  under  the  Norwegian  system  is,  &nbsp;</span><span>  when  the  chambers  disagree  for  both  to  &nbsp;</span><span>  sit  together  and  at  the  gross  majority</span><span>  decide  the  question.  But  that  practi-  &nbsp;</span><span>  cally  means  that  whenever  the  Houses</span><span>  differ  the  Lower  should  ride  roughshod</span><span>  over  the  Upper.  In  Victoria  at present</span><span>  the  Ministerial  majority  in  the  Assembly  &nbsp;</span><span>  is  about  equal  to  the  total  number  of</span><span>  members  in  the  Council.  If  they  were  &nbsp;</span><span>  ""  boxed,""  therefore,  the  first  division  &nbsp;</span><span>  would  settle  the  dispute  ;  but  such  a</span><span>  mode  of  settlement  could  not  possibly  &nbsp;</span><span>  be  satisfactory.  With  a  nominee  Upper  &nbsp;</span><span>  House  the  mere  threat  of  swamping  is</span><span>  the  practical  remedy  for  a  deadlock  ;  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  in  extreme  cases,  when  the  threat  needs</span><span>  to  be  carried  out,  it  can  only  be  done</span><span>  by  an  independent  and  impartial  &nbsp;</span><span>  authority—the  Crown.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  not  to  be  anticipated,  however,</span><span>  that  the  Legislative  Council  in  Victoria  &nbsp;</span><span>  will  accommodate  Mr.  Berry  by  amiably</span><span>  voting  their  own  extinction.  They  will,  &nbsp;</span><span>  at  any  rate,  require  that  the  constituencies</span><span>  be  first  appealed  to  on  the  question,  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  even  then  the  acquiescence  of veteran con-</span><span>  stitutionalists  of  the  Sir  Charles  Sladen  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  stamp  would  not  be  easily  obtained.</span><span>  Still,  in  proposing  a  nominee  House  we</span><span>  believe  Mr.  Berry  is  on  the  right  track,</span><span>  but  we  fear  that,  independent  of  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  personal  antagonism  he  will  encounter  &nbsp;</span><span>  after  the  late  events,  he  has  neither  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  tact  nor  temper  to  apply  so  ""  heroic  ""  a  &nbsp;</span><span>  remedy  to  the  body  politic.

The Fitzroy</span><span>  Lodge  of  Good  Templars  meet  at the customary</span></p> <p><span>  hour  this  evening  in  the  Oddfellows'  Hall.</span></p> <p><span>  A  VERY  heavy  shower  fell  in  the neigh-</span><span>  bourhood  of  Stanwell  and  the  Railway  Ten-</span><span>  mile  on  Wednesday  night,  starting  the  Deep</span><span>  and  Ten-mile  creek  with  a  turgid  current</span><span>  three  or  four  feet  in  depth.  Yesterday  after-</span><span>  noon  there  was  a  heavy  storm  to  the  west  and  &nbsp;</span><span>  north  of  Rockhampton,  and  as  the  atmosphere  &nbsp;</span><span>  has  been  warm  and  moist  for  several  days  &nbsp;</span><span>  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  the  rain  in  this  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  district  bas  been  pretty  general,  although  we</span></p> <p><span>  have  had  none  in  town.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  IN  mentioning  the  conversation  that</span><span>  occurred  at  the  proceedings  subsequent  to  the</span><span>  mayoral  election  on  Wednesday,  we  omitted</span><span>  to  say  that  Alderman  Sharples  first  brought</span><span>  up  the  subject  of  the  bridge  by  asking  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  Mayor  whether  it  was  the  duty  of  the</span><span>  Municipal  Council  or  the  Chamber  of  Com-</span><span>  merce  to  make  representations  with  respect  to  &nbsp;</span><span>  it.  The  Mayor  said  he  thought  that  the</span><span>  member  for  the  town  was  the  proper  medium</span><span>  of  communication  on  the  subject.  It  was  then  &nbsp;</span><span>  that  Aldermen  Feez  and  Higson  insisted  on</span><span>  the  necessity  of  measures  being  taken  to  bring  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  matter  under  the  notice  of  the Government,</span><span>  both  Aldermen  asserting  that,  judging  by  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  way  in  which  money  was  being  wasted,  the</span><span>  £38,000  voted  would  not  half  build  the  bridge.  &nbsp;</span><span>  Alderman  Bundy  said  he  happened  to  be  pas-</span><span>  sing  the  bridge  work  on  the  north  side  the</span><span>  other  day,  and  saw  three  men  employed  in  &nbsp;</span><span>  cutting  in  two  a  piece  of  ""3  x  2 quartering.""</span><span>  One  man  used  the  saw,  and  one  held  each  end</span><span>  of  the  timber.  Alderman  Feez,  bitterly  com-  &nbsp;</span><span>  plained  that  forty  good  men  had  been  thrown</span><span>  suddenly  out  of  work  by  the  suspension  of</span><span>  operations,  and  he  contended  that  the  appre-  &nbsp;</span><span>  hension  of  floods  ought  not  to  be  permitted  to</span><span>  bring  everything  to  a  standstill,  as  great  floods  &nbsp;</span><span>  were  of  only  rare  occurrence.  On  all  sides   </span><span>  extreme  dissatisfaction  was  expressed  at  the</span><span>  mode  of  conducting  the  works,  and  the</span><span>  unanimous  opinion  was  that  even  now  the</span><span>  bridge  ought  to  be  carried  out  by  contract.  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  THE  twelfth  monthly  meeting  of  the  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  Building  Society,  No.  6  was  held at</span><span>  the  Secretary's  offices  last  night.  The  sub-</span><span>  scriptions  received  amounted,  to  £243  17s.  4d.</span><span>  Two  advance  shares  were  sold  at  fourteen  per</span><span>  cent.  Messrs.  W.  F.  Walton  and  A.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.  j</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  MAJÎCII  20,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  crisis  in  Victoria  lias/  ended  unex-</span><span>  pectedly,  and  wc  may  almost  say</span><span>  ignominiously.  The  tender  is  that</span></p> <p><span>  with  suflh  a  solution  avail/ble  four  months</span><span>  ago  the\  deadlock  should  ever  have</span><span>  arisen.  Vhe  compromise  is  ridiculously</span><span>  simple,  ft  is  virtually/the  same  as  Thc</span><span>  Argus,  .SjVijfv  Mornmg  Herald,  and</span><span>  other  IcaduV;  journal*  urged  the  Legis-</span></p> <p><span>  lative  Cnumnl  to  acoept  three  montlis</span><span>  ago,  when  Mr.  Berny  at  the  eleventh</span><span>  hour  introdudM  the  temporary  Payment</span></p> <p><span>  of  Mcmbers'\\3ill  ap  a  concession  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  Council.V  And  a  substantial</span><span>  concession  it  was,  notwithstanding  the</span><span>  bluster  with  nhiah  ll  was  accompanied.</span></p> <p><span>  But  then  the  UpjW  House  refused  even</span></p> <p><span>  to  consider  the  rall,  because  they  de-</span></p> <p><span>  clared  that  an  attjwipt  to  coerce  them</span></p> <p><span>  was  involved  in  nil  mode  of  its  intro-</span></p> <p><span>  duction.  They  acrVmded  that  the  way</span><span>  should  be  made/clew  by.the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  withdrawing  the  item  for  payment</span></p> <p><span>  of  members  fro«i  the  Estimates.  This</span></p> <p><span>  possibly  they  liad  lh\  right  to  do,</span><span>  although  they  /were  noR  compelled  to</span></p> <p><span>  consider  the  Appropriation,  Bill  by  antici-</span></p> <p><span>  pation.  Surely  it  was  \uflicient  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  Council  that  ihey\  had  the</span><span>  unquestioned  power  to  \rcject  the</span><span>  Appropriation  Bill  if  il  did  not</span><span>  suit  them.  On  the  other  hand,  Mr.</span><span>  Berry  behaved  like  a  madman  in  threat-</span><span>  ening  the  Council  willi  extinction  if  they</span><span>  rejected  either  bill.  And  so  issue  was</span><span>  joined.  The  Council  would  sanction  no</span><span>  measure  under  coercion,  and  the  Min-</span><span>  istry,  as  a  means  of  intimidation,  inau-</span></p> <p><span>  gurated  chaos  on  ""  Black  Wednesday  '¡fi</span><span>  -the  day  of  wholesale/  dismissak^T</span><span>  public  xrvznls,ftr¡tkiÁ8tÍ&étvS  lan</span><span>  guage/í/e-ctar  dptffficoupAÚyiQAfáz</span></p> <p><span>  \AZm^^p^f^ß^^^  its  !</span></p> <p><span>  own,  .ind  Mibeférs/  Wave  not  daled  to  :</span><span>  carry  out  MeiT  thmsj^.t^Tfn;  Im-</span><span>  perial  Govcrnmepi'^has  ucen  appealed</span></p> <p><span>  to  and  refused  to  intervene.  And  after</span><span>  three  months  of  political  agitation,</span></p> <p><span>  social  disorder,  and  mercantile  and  '</span></p> <p><span>  industrial  paralysis,  both  parties  found  j</span><span>  the  situation  unchanged.  Tl«  knot  was  I</span><span>  less  amenable  to  treatment  t/an  before,  j</span></p> <p><span>  Force  had  »roved  inadequate  to  untie  it,</span><span>  and  it  became  clear  that  wh/ic  politicians</span><span>  quarrelled  healthful  progress  had  been  ex-</span></p> <p><span>  changed  forstagnation,  and  would  have</span><span>  been  quickly  lucceeded  fy  retrogression.</span><span>  So  that  oft-rccommenücd  instrument,</span><span>  compromise,  lira  at  length  to  be  resorted</span><span>  to,  and  when  \  quiakly  cut  the  knot,</span><span>  the  feeling  of  rehVf  «fas  accompanied  by</span><span>  a  sense  of  tile  rVh/ulous.  Thc  lesson</span><span>  taught  is  simply  wllpt  has  been  repeatedly</span><span>  demonstrated  in  jAcloria  and  elsewhere</span><span>  -that  where  /he\e  are  co-ordinate</span><span>  chambers  of  Legislature  neither  can  have</span></p> <p><span>  entirely  its  own/ivay,  and  thal  without  a  i</span><span>  spirit  of  mtituXl  concession  the  whole</span></p> <p><span>  machinery  off  government  must  soon</span><span>  come  lo  a  dcAd  stop.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  unsatisfactory  feature  about</span><span>  thc  compromise  is  thal  it  has  eventuated</span><span>  in  no  change  by  which  a  repetition  of</span><span>  the  deadlock  is  rendered  impracticable,</span></p> <p><span>  or  even  improbable.  AU  \hat  the</span><span>  people  of  Victoria  have  gained-  by  the</span><span>  crisis  is  costly  experience,  which  may  or</span><span>  mny  nol  serve  them  in  thc  future.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  JULY  22,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Parliament  of  Victoria  ts  again  in</span><span>  session,  and  its  proceedings  during  the</span><span>  ensuing  two  or  three  months  are  likely</span><span>  to  be  of  a  deeply  interesting  character.</span><span>  The  opening  speech  delivered  by  Sir</span><span>  George  Bowen  indicates  in  general</span><span>  terms  the  Ministerial  policy  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  session.</span></p> <p><span>  It  had  previously  been  understood  in</span><span>  official  circles  that  the  reform  of  the</span><span>  constitution  being  considered  by  Minis-</span><span>  ters  as  of  paramount  importance,  a  bill</span><span>  having  this  object  in  view  would</span><span>  be  dealt  with  at  once,  and  other  measures,</span><span>  excepting  any  of  an  urgent  character,</span><span>  would  stand  overuntil  the  Reform  Bill  had</span><span>  become  law.  It  appears,  however,  that</span><span>  in  addition  to  this  burning  constitutional</span><span>  question,  there  is  to  be  a  bill  to  authorise</span><span>  a  loan  of  almost  unprecedented  magni-</span><span>  tude.  The  Vice-regal  Speech,  touching</span><span>  upon  this  subject,  says  :</span></p> <p><span>  A  Railway  Construction  Bill,  embracing  the</span><span>  establishment  of  a  defined  state  system  of</span><span>  railways,  will  be  submitted  to  you.  The  in-</span><span>  creasing  demands  for  railway  facilities  now</span><span>  arising  from  extended  agricultural  settlement</span><span>  must  be  promptly  met,  if  that  settlement  is</span><span>  to  be  permanently  successful.  Main  trunk</span><span>  lines  also  to  the  junction  of  the  Barling  with</span><span>  the  Murray  and  to  tho  South  Australian</span><span>  border  are  imperatively  demanded  in  the</span><span>  interests  of  commerce.  The  increasing</span><span>  »venue  from  the  existing  lines-amounting  in</span><span>  the  last  year  to  one  million  two  hundred</span><span>  thousand  pounds-is  gratifying  evidence  of</span><span>  the  financial  soundness  of  the  policy  of  ex-</span><span>  tending  our  railways  to  meet  the  requirements</span><span>  of  the  agriculture  and  commerce  of  victoria.</span></p> <p><span>  The  amount  of  the  new  loan  is  not</span></p> <p><span>  stated,  but  it  is  currently  reported  that</span><span>  the  Government  proposals  contemplate</span><span>  the  construction  of  1000  miles  of  railway,</span><span>  which  at  ^6500  to  £7000  per  mile</span><span>  would  cost  from  £650,000  to  ,£700,000.</span><span>  This,  however,  is  not  the  only  item  in</span><span>  the  new  loan,  as  we  learn  from</span><span>  Sir  George  Bowen's  speech  that  pro-</span><span>  vision  is  also  to  be  made  for</span><span>  the  purchase  of  the  Melbourne  and</span><span>  Robson's  Bay  Railway,  the  extension  of</span><span>  waterworks,  the  further  erection  of  State</span><span>  Schools,  the  completion  of  the  Law</span><span>  Courts  and  of  the  Houses  of  Parliament,</span><span>  «nd  the  carrying  out  of  various  other</span><span>  public  works.  The  loan  will,  therefore,</span><span>  scarcely  fall  short  of  ;£  10,000,000.</span></p> <p><span>  The  length  of  railway  at  present  open</span><span>  for  traffic  in  Victoria,  is  967  miles,</span><span>  and  it  is  proposed  at  one  bound</span><span>  to  raise  the  total  mileage  to  more</span></p> <p><span>  han  double  that  amount.  The  area  of</span><span>  Victorian  territory  is  limited,  and  by  thc</span></p> <p><span>  time  this  scheme  is  carried  out  to  com-</span></p> <p><span>  pletion,  that  colony  should  be  completely</span><span>  covered  with  a  network  of  railways,</span><span>  providing  every  locality  of  importance</span><span>  with  railway  communication.  We  are</span><span>  not  prepared  to  condemn  the  scheme</span><span>  simply  on  account  of  its  magni-</span><span>  tude,  as  the  population  of  Victoria  is</span><span>  dense  in  comparison  with  that  of  other</span><span>  parts  of  Australia.  But  there  is  danger</span><span>  that  the  large  expenditure  in  contem-</span><span>  plation  will  not  be  carried  out  in  the  way</span><span>  best  calculated  to  benefit  the  colony.</span><span>  We  read  in  the  Victorian  papers  that  thc</span><span>  factories  in  that  colony,  many  of  which</span><span>  are  of  forced  growth,  are  partially  idle,</span><span>  and  industry  generally  is  greatly  para-</span><span>  lysed.  The  Ministerial  organs  have  been</span><span>  demanding  as  a  remedy  for  this  unsatis-</span><span>  factory  state  of  things  the  initiation  of  a</span><span>  grand  scheme  of  public  works,  and  an</span><span>  increase  in  the  Customs  tariff  on  im-</span></p> <p><span>  ports  to  a  prohibitive  point.  The</span><span>  rolling  stock  for  the  new  railways,</span><span>  it  is  urged,  should  all  be  made  in</span><span>  the  colony,  and  the  duties  on  imported</span><span>  articles  should  be  increased  so  as  to  give</span></p> <p><span>  the  local  manufacturer  full  command  of</span><span>  the  market.  The  Government  have  not</span></p> <p><span>  intimated  their  intention  to  propose  any</span><span>  alteration  in  the  tariff  during  the  present</span><span>  session,  but  they  have  so  far  complied</span><span>  with  the  demands  of  their  supporters  as</span><span>  to  bring  forward  a  comprehensive</span><span>  scheme  of  public  works,  and  taking</span><span>  into  consideration  their  protectionist</span></p> <p><span>  proclivities,  we  may  safely  assume  that  i</span><span>  the  loan  will  be,  as  far  as  possible,  ex-</span><span>  pended  in  the  colony,  and  colonial</span></p> <p><span>  manufacturers  will  be  favoured  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  expense  of  other  classes  in  the  commu-</span><span>  nity.  The  expenditure  will  give  a</span><span>  new  lease  of  power  to  the  Berry</span><span>  Ministry,  and  local  manufacturers  will</span><span>  grow  rich;  but  the  prosperity  thus</span><span>  created  will  haye  no  substantial  founda-</span><span>  tion,  and  cannot  be  expected  to  prove</span><span>  other  than  temporary.  The  public  works,</span><span>  if  judiciously  planned  in  accordance  with</span><span>  public  requirements,  will  doubtless  be  of</span><span>  permanent  service  to  the  colony,  but</span><span>  their  cost  will  be  enhanced  beyond  their</span><span>  real  value  by  the  Government  declining</span><span>  to  take  advantage  of  an  open  market,</span><span>  and  a  needless  charge  will  be  thrown</span><span>  upon  the  future  taxation  of  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  Ia  reference  to  the  Constitutional</span><span>  question,  Sir  George  Bowen,  with  the</span><span>  advice  of  his  Ministers,  indulges  in  the</span><span>  following  well-rounded  sentences  :</span></p> <p><span>  The  Constitution  established  in  this  country</span><span>  nearly  a  quarter  of  a  century  ato  was,  without</span><span>  doubt,  intended  to  be  fashioned  on  the  model</span><span>  of  the  British  Constitution.  Unhappily  the</span><span>  attempt  to  embody  tn  comparatively  rigid</span><span>  statute  law  the  elasticity  inherent  in  the</span><span>  principles  and  practice  of  that  Constitution</span><span>  not  been  completely  succeisf  ul,  and  differences</span><span>  in  the  interpretation  of  our  Constitution  Act</span><span>  have  resulted  in  bringing  the  legislative</span><span>  machinery  of  the  state  to  a  temporary  stand-</span></p> <p><span>  still  on  no  less  than  four  different  occasions,</span></p> <p><span>  A  measure  of  Constitutional  Reform,  aiming  at</span><span>  a  final  adjustment  of  the  legislative  functions</span><span>  of  both  the  Council  and  the  Assembly,  will  be</span><span>  immediately  laidljclore  you,  anrt-untioutrtcdlT</span><span>  will  be  considered  from  a  patriotic  point  of</span><span>  view  by  the  members  of  both  Houses,</span><span>  irrespective  of  party.  Its  acceptance  will  put</span><span>  an  end  for  all  time  to  the  recurrence  of  thoBe</span><span>  periodical  ""deadlocks""  which  are  so  injurious</span><span>  to  trade  and  commerce,  and  a  standing  dis-</span><span>  grace  to  the  constitutional  institutions  of</span></p> <p><span>  Victoria.</span></p> <p><span>  We  are  almost  warranted  in  gathering</span><span>  from  these  utterances,  that  the  great</span><span>  question  of  the  reform  of  the  Legislative</span><span>  Council  has  been  reduced  within  a  small</span><span>  compass,  and  the  Government  now</span><span>  merely  contemplate  the  introduction  of  a</span><span>  measure  aiming  at  a  final  adjustment  of</span><span>  the  legislative  functions  of  the  Council</span><span>  and  Assembly.  The  adjustment  will</span><span>  probably  be  attained  by  vesting  in  the</span><span>  Assembly  the  sole  control  of  the  public</span></p> <p><span>  finances.</span></p> <p><span>  TBS  magisterial  inquiry  into  the  death  of</span><span>  Michael  O'Donogbue,  at  the  Lake's  Creek</span><span>  Quarry,  was  resumed  before  the  Police  Magis-</span><span>  trate  on  Saturday,  and  the  evidence  of  Dr.</span><span>  Salmond  and  Constable  Slacking  heard.  No</span><span>  additional  particulars  beyond  those  already</span><span>  published  were  elicited.  The  depositions  will</span><span>  bs  forwarded  in  the  usual  manner  to  the</span><span>  Attorney-General.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Committee  of  the  Fitzroy  Pastoral  and</span><span>  Agricultural  Society  have,  we  think,  acted</span><span>  wisely  in  increasing  the  priée  they  propose  to</span><span>  offer  for  the  best  managed  farm  from  thirty  to</span><span>  fifty  guineas.  The  district  around  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  is  admittedly  backward  in  agricultural</span><span>  pursuits,  and  a  stimulus  such  as  that  proposed</span><span>  to  be  given  by  the  prize  above-mentioned,</span><span>  should  have  the  effect  of  inducing  our  farmers</span><span>  to  vie  with  each  other  in  friendly  rivalry  for</span><span>  the  attainment  of  excellence  in  an  occupation</span><span>  upon  the  successful  prosecution  of  which  the</span><span>  assured  prosperity  of  the  country  very  largely</span><span>  depends.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court,  on  Saturday,  the  case</span><span>  of  Charles  Plum  v.  Thomas  Henry  Cavanagh,</span><span>  was  brought  on,  the  magistrates  present  being</span><span>  Messrs.  T,  P.  Pugh  (P,  M.),  W.  J  Taylor,  and</span><span>  James  Thomson,  J.J.P.  It  appeared  that</span><span>  Cavanagh  had  been  summoned,  on  an  infor-</span><span>  mation  laid  by  complainant,  for  unlawfully</span><span>  refusing  to  pay  wages  due  to  him  as</span><span>  his  apprentice.  The  case  had  been  called</span><span>  on  the  previous  day,  but  Cavanagh  not</span><span>  answering  to  the  summons,  a  warrant  was</span><span>  signed  by  the  Police  Magistrate  for  his</span><span>  apprehension.  The  warrant  was  not  executed</span><span>  until  Saturday  morning,  when  the  defendant</span><span>  was  waited  upon  by  a  constable  and  politely</span><span>  requested  to  accompany  him  to  the  lockup,</span><span>  which  he  did  accordingly,  and  was  confined  in</span><span>  the  cells  for  an  hour  until  the  Court  opened  at</span><span>  ten  o'clock.  The  case  being  called  on,  both</span><span>  parties  were  present,  and  the  evidence  of  com-</span><span>  plainant  was  proceeding  when  Mr.  Hill,  C.P.S.,</span><span>  handed  to  the  Bench  a  cheque  he  had  received</span><span>  from  the  defendant  through  the  post  for  the</span><span>  sum  of  25s.,  being  the  amount  claimed,  toge-</span><span>  ther  with  5s.  cost  of  summons.  The  cheque</span><span>  had  been  posted  on  the  previous  Wednesday,</span><span>  and  this  fact  was  accepted  by  the  Bench  as</span><span>  proof  that  defendant  was  not  disposed  to  con-</span><span>  test  the  case,  and  that  he  had  not  been</span><span>  guilty  of  intentional  contempt  of  Court  in</span><span>  failing  to  put  in  an  appearance  on  Friday,</span></p> <p><span>  when  the  case  was  first  called  on.  The</span><span>  Bench,  after  some  consultation,  decided  to</span><span>  accept  the  cheque  in  settlement  of  the  claim,</span><span>  and  dismissed  the  case.  Mr.  Cavanagh  has</span><span>  been  put  to  great  annoyance  in  this  matter,</span><span>  but  neither  the  officers  of  the  Court  nor  the</span><span>  Bench  appear  in  any  way  to  blame  for  it.

To  those  who  are</span><span>  unacrjiiainted  with  the  play,  it  will  suffice  to</span><span>  simply  state  that  the  moral  is  intended  to</span><span>  convey  the  many  evils  that  accrue  from  a  too</span><span>  free  use  of  intoxicating  drinks.  The  argu-</span><span>  ments  in  the  play  in  this  direction  are  many</span><span>  and  powerful,  and  that  the  majority  of  the</span><span>  audience  agreed  with  tho  sentiments  expressed</span><span>  was  ehown  by  the  frequent  and  genuine  ap-</span><span>  plause  that  invariably  followed  the  declaration</span><span>  of  such  opinions.  Mrs.  Horgan  is  not  a  strong</span><span>  cast  for  a  lady  of  Miss  Clara  Stephenson's</span><span>  ability,  but  shs  made  the  most  of  it,  and  was</span><span>  warmly  applauded  for  her  efforts.  The</span><span>  Jot  Horgan  of  Mr.  W.  Seagrave  was  a</span><span>  masterly  piece  of  acting,  bis  make-np  for  that</span><span>  drunken  sot  being  capital.  Mr.  G.  P.  Carey</span><span>  was  entrusted  with  the  partot  SamptlSaitehM,</span><span>  snd  to  say  that  he  played  it  well  is  to  put  it</span><span>  very  mildly.

Mr.  Thorpe  oho  did  well  by  Harvey</span><span>  Oreen.  The  success  of  an  actor  who  plays</span><span>  the  part  of  ""villain""  depends  in  a  great</span><span>  measure  on  whether  the  character  is</span><span>  made  sufficiently  detestable;  and  that</span><span>  Mr.  Thorpe  eminently  succeeded  may</span><span>  be  inferred  from  the  delight  expressed  by</span><span>  the  audience  at  hiB  capture.  Mr.  Vincent,  as</span><span>  the  landlord  Simon  Slade,  and  Mr.  Bolton,  as</span><span>  WUUt  Hammond,  were  also  clever  portrayals.</span><span>  JUaldtable  Oartieright  found  an  able  exponent</span><span>  in  Miss  Maggie  Ford,  and  the  other  minor</span><span>  characters  were  remarkably  well  rendered.</span><span>  In  conclusion,  Miss  Lilly  Vincent,  who  played</span><span>  the  part  of  Mary  Morgan,  can  scarcely  be</span><span>  too  highly  extolled  for  the  affecting  manner  in</span><span>  which  she  personated  the  sick  and  dying  girl  ;</span><span>  the  part  is  a  long  and  trying  one  for  a  child  of</span><span>  such  tender  years  (she  caa  scarcely  be  more</span><span>  than  seven),  yet  she  hardly  misBed  a  word,</span><span>  and  had  the  entire  audience  eagerly  listening</span><span>  for  every  sentence  that  fell  from  her  dying</span><span>  lips,  The  tableau  at  the  end  of  the  fifth  act,</span><span>  with  Mary  kneeling  in  the  background</span><span>  in  angelic  form,  was  strikingly  beautiful,  and</span><span>  the  curtain  fell  amidst  a  perfect  storm  of  ap-</span><span>  plause.

He  saw  de-</span><span>  ceased  alive  about  a  fortnight  ago,  and  as  he</span><span>  had  not  been  near  their  place  tor  hts  usual</span><span>  relief  on  Saturday  morning,  witnesB  and  a</span><span>  brother  eleven  years  of  age  were  sent  by  their</span><span>  mother  to  the  deceased's  lint,  to  see  if  be  was</span><span>  at  home.  On  looking  through  the  door  they</span><span>  saw  deceased  lying  on  a  stretcher,  and  witness</span><span>  thought  be  was  dead,  but  his  brother  fancied</span><span>  he  saw  him  move.  Tiley  returned  home,  and</span><span>  again,  at  bis  mother's  request,  returned  to</span><span>  deceased's  hut  and  spoke  to  him  ;  but,  getting</span><span>  no  answer,  witness  removed  the  body  to  the</span><span>  police  Btation.  Mounted  Constable  Gannon,</span><span>  of  Myers's  Flat,  said  there  were  no  clothing,</span><span>  bedding,  or  blankets,  or  any  other  covering</span><span>  in  the  hut,  but  a  lot  of  most  filthy  raga.  The</span><span>  left  cheek  and  part  of  the  nose  had  been</span><span>  eaten  away  by  some  animal.  The  body  was</span><span>  in  a  moat  filthy  condition,  and  the  de-</span><span>  ceased  appeared  not  to  have  been  washed</span><span>  for  months.  There  was  no  appearance</span><span>  of  a  struggle  in  the  hut,  and  witness  bad  no</span><span>  suspicion  of  foul  play.  The  hut  was  a  most</span><span>  wretched  hovel,  and  unfit  for  any  human</span><span>  being  to  occupy,  and  there  was  no  food  of  any</span><span>  kind  inside  it.  Dr.  Cheyne,  of  Eaglehawk,</span><span>  deposed  to  having  made  a  post-mortem  ex-</span><span>  amination  of  the  body  of  the  deceased,  which</span><span>  he  found  in  an  extremely  emaciated  and  much</span></p> <p><span>  neglected  condition.  The  cause  of  death  was</span><span>  exhaustion,  consequent  upon  starvation  and</span><span>  neglect.  The  body  was  insufficiently  clad,</span><span>  and  tbe  few  clothes  on  it  were  actually  rotting</span><span>  from  dirt.  The  body  luid  not  known  water</span><span>  for  months,  and  had  evidently  been  dead  for</span><span>  some  days.  The  jury  found  that,  on  or  about</span><span>  the  22nd  day  of  June,  1878,  at  Dead  Horse</span><span>  Flat,  Eaglehawk,  the  deceased,  Edward  Eyers,</span><span>  died  from  starvation  and  exposure  to  cold.  -</span><span>  Bendigo  Advertiser.</span></p> <p><span>  EKEHPITHO  VOLUNTEERS.-What  a  thrill  of</span><span>  joy  will  piena  the  manly  breatta  of  our  Volun-</span><span>  teer*  when  their  eyea  light  upon  these  words</span><span>  in  our  telegram  :-""Â  pravuo  tau  added  to</span><span>  dawe  Sb  of  tiie  Volunteer  Bill,  exempting</span><span>  Volunteers  from  flogging.""

The  Dally  Telegraph  April  2,</span><span>  states  that  last  August  the  landlord  of  a</span><span>  tavern  in  West-street,  Sheffield,  hired  a</span><span>  piano  from  a  well-known  firm  of  manufac-</span><span>  turers,  on  the  usual  understanding  that  if  the</span><span>  periodical  payments  were  punctually  made</span><span>  the  piano  was  to  become,  at  the  expiration  of</span><span>  three  years,  his  own  property.  He  was  to  pay</span><span>  fifteen  pounds  a  year  in  equal  monthly</span><span>  instalments,  and  on  commencing  his  tenure  of</span><span>  the  piano  he  undertook  not  to  remove  the</span><span>  instrument  from  his  premises  without  the</span><span>  permission  of  the  manufacturers,  who,  it  was</span><span>  covenanted  between  the  parties,  were  to  be</span><span>  entitled  to  enter  and  retake  possession  of  their</span><span>  chattel  should  the  publican  get  into  difficulties.</span><span>  Into  very  serious  difficulties  he  speedily  got  ;</span><span>  for  he  -paid  the  first  and  only  instalment  in</span><span>  August,  and  in  December  he  filed  a  petition</span><span>  for  the  liquidation  of  his  affairs.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin.</span><span>  ROCKHAMPTON</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  OCTOBER  2,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  entire  absence  of  a  good  political</span><span>  cry  is  reducing  the  heretofore  paramount</span><span>  parly  to  sad  straits.  For  want  of  some</span><span>  more  effective  platform,  the  information</span><span>  is  being  disseminated  throughout  the</span><span>  country  that  the  Roman  Catholic  body</span><span>  is  determined  to  make  a  desperate  effort</span><span>  to  recover  lost  ground,  and  to  get  the</span><span>  Education  Act  of  1875  repealed.  At</span><span>  first  we  were  not  inclined  to  take  notice</span><span>  of  this  rumour,  but  it  is  being  so  per-</span><span>  sistently  circulated,  and  backed  up  by</span><span>  such  bold  assertion,  that  on  public</span><span>  grounds  we  have  made  inquiries  from</span><span>  those  who  should  know  as  to  whether</span><span>  any  such  intention  is  cherished.  Our</span><span>  information  is  directly  to  the  contrary</span><span>  effect,  and  we  have  reason  to  believe</span><span>  that  the  Roman  Catholic  authorities  have</span><span>  not  the  slightest  intention  to  advise  their</span><span>  people  to  make  the  Education  question</span><span>  a  test-point  with  candidates.  They  must</span><span>  be  conscious  that  the  paramount  feeling</span><span>  of  the  country  is  against  them,  and  that</span><span>  any  effort  to  import  denominationalism</span><span>  into  electioneering  would  end  in  a  more</span><span>  decisive  defeat  than  was  sustained  on  the</span><span>  last  occasion.  There  are  among  Roman</span><span>  Catholic  clergy  the  antitheses  of  those</span><span>  Protestant  firebrands  who  smell  powder</span><span>  in  every  corner  ;  but  it  is  a  libel  upon</span><span>  the  Roman  Catholic  body  to  accuse</span><span>  them  of  the  determination  to  make  every</span><span>  consideration  subordinate  to  sectarian</span><span>  objects.  We  prefer  believing  that  the</span><span>  time  has  arrived  when  the  bulk  of  the</span><span>  community,  Protestant  as  well  as</span><span>  Catholic,  are  prepared  to  deal  with</span><span>  political  questions  on  their  merits,  and,</span><span>  in  choosing  candidates  to  represent  them</span><span>  in  the  Parliament  of  the  colony,  to</span><span>  select  the  best  men  irrespective  of  class,</span><span>  creed,  or  country.  The  time  has  passed</span><span>  when  neighbours  and  fellow-colonists</span><span>  engaged  in  mortal  combat  for  the  settle-</span><span>  ment  of  sectarian  differences,  and  we</span><span>  are  now  living  in  an  age  when  every</span><span>  intelligent  man  is  prepared  to  accord  to</span><span>  his  neighbour  the  same  freedom  of</span><span>  thought  and  action  which  he  demands</span></p> <p><span>  for  himself.</span></p> <p><span>  That  small  and  uninfluential  section  of</span><span>  the  Press  which  is  attempting  to  arouse  a</span><span>  sectarian  scare,  not  only  indulges  in  the</span><span>  suppressio  veri,  but  also  in  the  suggestio</span><span>  falsi.  Finding  its  insinuations  and  innu-</span><span>  endoes  received  incredulously,  it  now</span><span>  ventures  upon  the  definite  assertion  that</span><span>  a  compact  has  been  entered  into  betweei</span><span>  the  ""Squatting  Opposition""  and  the</span><span>  Roman  Catholic  priesthood  to  subvert</span><span>  the  educational  system  of  the  colony</span><span>  and  it  professes  to  be  in  possession  of</span><span>  proof  that  the  slander  is  true.  The  im-</span><span>  probability  of  such  a  story  does  not  in</span><span>  the  least  stagger  its  authors  ;  and  if  they</span><span>  do  not  forget  that  the  Education  Bill  was</span><span>  a  non-party  measure,  they  wish  to  blind</span><span>  the  public  to  the  fact.  They  quite  omit</span><span>  to  mention  that  when  the  late  leader  of</span><span>  the  Opposition  voted  for  the  Education</span><span>  Bill  he  divided  his  own  party  in  order  to</span><span>  vindicate  his  consistency,  and  his  cosmo-</span><span>  politan  professions  of  former  years</span><span>  and  they  also  ignore  the  fact  that  the</span><span>  then  Premier-Mr.  Macalister-voted</span><span>  for  the  bill  in  violation  of  his  written</span><span>  pledges-upon  which  pledges,  in  fact</span><span>  he  had  secured  his  election  to  Parlia-</span><span>  ment  less  than  two  years  previously.  And</span><span>  so  far  as  we  can  ascertain,  every  public</span><span>  man  who  sat  on  the  Opposition  side  and</span><span>  followed  his  leader  in  heartily  supporting</span><span>  the  Education  Bill  of  1875  still  adheres</span><span>  to  the  convictions  then  given  effect  to,</span><span>  and  has  no  more  thought  of  retracing  his</span></p> <p><span>  steps  than  the  firmest  opponent  of</span><span>  denominationalisrn  on  the  Ministerial</span><span>  side.  Nothing  has  transpired  to  indi-</span><span>  cate  that  the  State  education  system  is</span><span>  a  failure,  or  that  any  important  modifi-</span><span>  cation  in  the  Act  is  demanded  by  the</span><span>  country.  It  was,  in  fact,  Mr.  Palmer's</span><span>  own  measure,  and  he  would  be  among</span><span>  the  last  men  in  the  country  to  turn  his</span><span>  back  upon  himself  on  a  public  question</span><span>  universally  admitted  to  be  of  the  highest</span></p> <p><span>  importance.</span></p> <p><span>  But,  it  will  be  argued,  Mr.  Palmer</span><span>  was  one  of  those  members  who</span><span>  gave  the  denominational  schools  an</span><span>  optional  six  years'  additional  lease  of</span><span>  life;  which  is  perfectly  true.  And</span><span>  in  that  Act  he  proved  himself  to</span><span>  be  a  statesman  and  not  a  bigot.  The</span><span>  denominational  schools  in  existence    in</span><span>  1875  were  founded  under  the  protection</span><span>  of  an  Act  of  Parliament,  and  were</span><span>  legally  entitled  to  a  certain  annual</span><span>  endowment.  To  withdraw  that  endow-</span><span>  ment  without  notice,  and  sweep  those</span><span>  schools  suddenly  off  the  face  of  the  earth,</span><span>  would  have  been  unjust  and  impolitic.</span><span>  All  any  reasonable  man  could  ask  was</span><span>  that  the  principle  of  national  and  secular</span><span>  education  should  be  affirmed  in  the  first</span><span>  instance,  and  then  that  time  should  be</span><span>  allowed  for  carrying  it  into  effect.  In</span><span>  1875,  of  a  total  expenditure  of  £96,000</span><span>  upon  education,  £6000  only  was  applied</span><span>  to  denominational  schools,  and  that  by</span><span>  the  new  Act  was  continued  for  a  term  of</span><span>  six  years.  Thus  the  question  was</span><span>  definitely  settled,  and  although  we  think</span><span>  that  at  the  time  a  still  longer  term  might</span><span>  have  been  allowed,  the  law  cannot  now</span><span>  be  altered,  and  we  are  quite  sure  that  no</span><span>  party  in  the  present  or  in  the  next  Par-</span><span>  liament  would  entertain  the  proposition  to</span><span>  repeal  or  seriously  modify  the  Education</span><span>  Act  in  this  particular.  When,  therefore,</span><span>  the  Evangelical  Standard  affirms  that  a</span><span>  compact  has  been  entered  into  with  that</span><span>  object,  it  simply  affirms  that  which  is  not</span></p> <p><span>  true.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  usual  fortnightly  sitting  of  tho  Petty</span><span>  Dobts  Court  will  be  held  this  morning.

With  a  view  to  pro-</span><span>  mote  this  oljcct,  he  published  a  small  work</span><span>  elaborating  a  scheme  for  converting  thc</span><span>  aboriginal  tmguo  into  a  language  expressed  in</span><span>  Roman  clm-actere  ;  but  thc  reclamation</span><span>  project  reeived  hut  scant  sympathy,  and</span><span>  after  sonic  years  of  pastoral  laliour  in  the</span><span>  north,  Mr.  Ridley  returned  to  Sydney.</span><span>  There  lie  utimately  associated  himself  with</span><span>  tho  Biiipire  newspaper,  and,  as  editor  of  that</span><span>  journal  ondthe  Èvniiinj  Krina  for  a  period  ex-</span><span>  tending  oicr  twenty  years,  earned  the</span><span>  character  o'  a  painstaking  and  conscientious</span><span>  «Titer.

Samoa  than  America,  and  each</span><span>  demands  tlat  thcBC  countries  shall  be  placed</span><span>  upon  the  same  footing  with  America,  and,</span><span>  failing  that,  they  will  probably  refuse  io</span><span>  recognise  the  power  of  the  Government  to</span><span>  grant  such  one-sided  privileges.  In  that</span><span>  event,  in  what  hotter  position  will  America  bo</span><span>  with  her  treaty  than  she  was  before  it  ?  There</span><span>  is  rather  too  much  self  exhibited  in  this</span></p> <p><span>  treaty.  It  is  not  the  SawoanB  they  wish  to  '</span><span>  protect,  but  themselves,  sad  in  this  thoy  have</span><span>  gone  rather  too  far  in  providing  that  neither</span><span>  import  nor  export  duties  aro  to  be  charged.</span><span>  They  have  thus  defeated  their  own  ends.  It</span><span>  will  bo  noticed,  also,  that  the  treaty  bas  been</span><span>  ratified  without  reference  to  tho  Samoa</span><span>  Government.If  our  infor-</span><span>  mation  be  correct,  and  wc  beb'eve  it  cannot  be</span><span>  denied,  England  hos  moro  than  double  the</span></p> <p><span>  vested  interest  in  Samoa  than  that  of</span></p> <p><span>  America,  According  to  inquiries  we  have</span><span>  made  upon  this  subject,  wc  believe  we  do  not</span><span>  go  beyond  the  mark  when  we  state  that  thc</span><span>  value  of  British  property  in  the  group  is</span><span>  500,000  dollars,  whilst  that  of  American</span><span>  citizens  will  be  fully  covered  by  200,000.</span><span>  The  number  of  souls  claiming  British  protec-</span><span>  tion  is  271,  whilst  about  73  is  the  sum  total  of</span><span>  Americans.  In  addition  to  this,  wo  notice</span><span>  that,  during  the  last  ten  months,  thc  amount</span><span>  of  American  tonnage  trading  to  these  islands</span><span>  was  710,  whilst  tliat  of  British  traders  was</span><span>  1923.  We  think,  under  these  circumstances,</span><span>  that  Great  Britain  is  more  than  likely  to  look</span><span>  for  a  share  of  the  treaty.</span></p> <p><span>  ANOTHER  LESSON  FOR  SAMOA.  -  An  ex-</span><span>  change  says  that  Germany  has  taught  the</span><span>  Samoans  the  necessity  of  paying  their  debts.</span><span>  Fines,  amounting  in  all  to  885  dollars  85  cents,</span><span>  have  been  awarded  to  German  citizens  by</span><span>  Samoan  judges,  but  delay  was  experienced  in</span><span>  paying  them.  During  several  months  the  sum</span><span>  was  reduced  to  111  dollars  42  cents,  which  the</span><span>  Samoans  refused  to  pay.  Recently  the  Ger-</span><span>  man  Consul  demanded  payment,  under  the</span><span>  threat,  if  not  complied  with,  of  referring  the</span><span>  matter  to  Captain  Von  Werner,  of  the  Ari-</span><span>  adne.  Foolishly  relying  upon  assistance  from</span><span>  the  American  ship  of  war,  as  it  is  said,  they</span><span>  treated  this  with  contempt.  Accordingly,</span><span>  as  soon  as  the  time  had  expired,  the  boats</span><span>  were  got  out,  and  some  eighty  men  armed  and</span><span>  in  the  boats  ready  for  action  as  soon  as  the</span></p> <p><span>  final  instructions  were  given  by  the  captain.</span><span>  These  preparations  being  observed  by  the</span><span>  natives,  and  finding  that  they  were  not  likely</span><span>  to  get  any  help,  they  sent  one  of  their  party</span><span>  in  hot  haste  to  inform  the  captain  that  the</span><span>  money  was  on  the  shore  ready.  It  is  time</span><span>  these  people  learnt  that  they  cannot  treat</span><span>  these  matters  with  contempt,  and  we  are  glad</span><span>  to  see  that  upon  this  occasion  there  was  no</span><span>  attempt  to  hoist  the  American  flag  over  that</span><span>  of  the  Samoan,  as  was  done  when  the  Barra-</span><span>  couta  fine  was  enforced.  The  only  way  to</span><span>  deal  with  these  people  is  by  a  strong  hand.</span><span>  Experience  has  shown  us  that  leniency  only</span><span>  tends  to  make  them  bold  and  overbearing  ;</span><span>  gratitude  is  not  a  part  of  their  constitution.</span></p> <p><span>  A  MINISTERIAL  ORRAN  os  TUE  MINISTRY.</span><span>  -The  Warwirh  Argus  favours  its  readers</span><span>  with  a  little  plain  speaking  relative  to  thc</span><span>  diseutcgration  of  thc  Douglas  Ministry.  Our</span><span>  contemporary  says  :-Mr.  Douglas  has  indeed</span><span>  been  most  unfortunate  during  bis  tenure  of</span><span>  office  as  Premier,  but  we  are  unable  to  açrce</span><span>  with  thc  Telegraph,  which,  taking  Mr.  Miles'</span><span>  resignation  as  a  text,  proceeds  to  show  that</span><span>  thc  disintegration  of  thc  Ministry  is  due  to</span><span>  faults  in  its  leader.  It  has  been  Mr.  Douglas'</span><span>  misfortune  to  conic  into  office  at  thc  cud  of  a</span><span>  long  political  struggle,-at  a  time  when</span><span>  politics  were  comparatively  flat  and  un</span><span>  interesting,-and  he  has  consequently  received</span><span>  only  n  lukewarm  support  from  his  own  party,</span><span>  and  has  had  to  take  colleagues  where  he  could</span><span>  find  them.  Under  these  circumstances  he  has</span><span>  been  the  head  of  a  Ministry  some  of  whose</span><span>  members  have  earned  their  promotion  neither</span><span>  by  length  of  service  nor  conspicuous  ability,</span><span>  and  which  was  not  held  together  by  the</span><span>  pressure  of  agreement  on  a  great  question  in</span><span>  dispute,  lt  is  not  to  bc  wondered  at  if  such  a</span><span>  fortuitous  association  of  individuals  should</span></p> <p><span>  occasionally  break  up.  It  is  perhaps  not</span><span>  ?mich  to  lie  regretted  ,  if  it  happened  after  thc</span><span>  general  election  ;  but  it  will  bo  to  bc  regretted</span><span>  if  such  a  break-up  shall  take  place  before  that</span><span>  time.  As  far  as  Messrs.  Miles  and  Garrick</span><span>  are  concerned,  their  retirement  should  not</span><span>  break  np  any  Ministry.  They  are  both  very</span><span>  respectable  members  of  the  Legislative</span><span>  Assembly,  hut  as  Ministers,  or  even  as</span><span>  politicians,  they  are  not  distinguished  alxwe</span><span>  their  fellows.  Who  arc  to  succeed  them  we</span><span>  know  not.  In  fact,  it  is  as  yet  only  a  rumor</span><span>  that  Mr.  Garrick's  scat  in  the  Cabinet  will  tic</span><span>  come  vacant.  Mr.  Tyrel  and  Mr.  Macfarlane</span><span>  are  perhaps  the  two  most  likely  men  amongst</span><span>  thc  suppnrtcrK  of  the  Ministry  to  fill  vacancies</span></p> <p><span>  iu  tile  Cabinet,  and  wc  do  not  see  that  their  i</span><span>  substitution  for  Messrs,  Garrick  and  Miles</span></p> <p><span>  would  weaken  the  Ministry  by  diminishing</span><span>  their  capacity  for  business  or  lessening  the</span><span>  confidence  of  tho  country  in  itapersonnet</span></p> <p><span>  A  CANDIDATO  Fort  CLERMONT.-It  has  been</span><span>  long  rumoured  (says  thc  P.  1).

In</span><span>  mining  matters  we  arc  getting  along  first-class.</span><span>  The  Mount  Look-out  shaft  fr  turning  out  some</span><span>  very  high  percentage  ore.  This  lode  was  not</span><span>  looking  so  well  last  week,  but  by  sinking  on</span><span>  the  course  of  the  lode  it  looks  aa  well  as</span><span>  when  it  was  first  started  from  thc  surface.</span><span>  Tlie  iron  lode,  or,  as  some  call  it,  ""The</span><span>  Channon,""  has  some  very  good  ore  to  grass  ;</span><span>  but  it  is  not  of  such  good  quality  as  the</span><span>  Mount  Look-out  ore,  though  far  easier  to</span></p> <p><span>  smelt,  whereas,  the  Mount  Look-out  ore  is  j</span><span>  hard  to  smelt,  and  thc  one  mixed  with  the  j</span><span>  other  makes  it  good  work  for  the  smelter.  !</span><span>  This  lode,  I  heard  one  well-known  authority  ,</span><span>  remark,  is  a  'ßegular  booty.'  I  saw  some  j</span></p> <p><span>  splendid  blue  carbonates  to-day  brought  to</span><span>  tho  Bbed,  supposed  to  be  (by  competent  judges)</span><span>  1  35  per  cent.  Those  working  on  the  freehold</span></p> <p><span>  speak  in  high  terms  of  that  property  ;  but,  as  |</span></p> <p><span>  I  have  not  seen  it  yet,  I  am  not  in  a  position</span></p> <p><span>  to  speak  of  it.  Messrs.  Ironside  and  Pugslcy,  j</span><span>  well  known  Mackay  carriers,  will  load  up  three  1</span><span>  waggons  with  copper  on  Monday.  With  regard</span><span>  to  smelting  I  cannot  speak  so  favourably,  for,</span><span>  owing  to  thc  refractory  nature  of  the  ores,  and</span><span>  also  thc  high  percentage,  all  of  which  are  one</span><span>  clasB  carbonates,  the  work  was  very  difficult.</span></p> <p><span>  The  firebricks  have  not  stood  os  well  as  was</span></p> <p><span>  expected,  but  it  must  be  remembered  they</span><span>  have  had  a  very  severe  test  on  account  of  the</span><span>  ores  being  so  bad  to  smelt.  I  do  not  mean  to</span><span>  state  that  the  firebricks  arc  a  failure,  for  they</span><span>  stand  very  well  in  the  stack  ;  in  fact  every-</span><span>  where,  except  the  roof  of  the  furnace,  where</span><span>  the  greatest  heat  is.  Mr.  Laun  is  about  to</span><span>  try  some  new  clay,  which  is  within  two  miles</span><span>  of  thc  furnace.  It  has  very  much  the  appear-</span><span>  ance  of  pipe  clay  ;  and  that  mixed  with  quartz</span><span>  sand  should  make  a  good  firebrick.  The  shed</span><span>  IB  very  nearly  finished,  and  when  completed</span></p> <p><span>  will  cover  in  three  furnaces.  The  stack  for</span></p> <p><span>  thc  -ouuond  furnace  is  going  up;  it  is  now</span><span>  forty  feet  high,  and  there  are  thirty  tbouBand</span><span>  bricks  burning.""</span></p> <p><span>  Prtorosr.n  MONETARY  CONFERENCE.--The</span></p> <p><span>  English  mail  via  Sau  Francisco  brings  news</span><span>  that  Mr.  Goschen,  who  is  to  represent  Eng-</span><span>  land  at  the  Monetary  Conference  proposed  by</span><span>  thc  United  States,  has  stated  that  Great</span><span>  Britain  reserves  the  right  to  maintain  the  gold</span><span>  standard.  Thc  meaning  of  this  statement</span><span>  will  bc  understood  by  a  perusal  of  thc  follow-</span><span>  ing  extract  from  thc  ""City  article,""  in  the</span><span>  World  of  July  31  :-""  The  invitations  issued</span></p> <p><span>  by  the  President  of  the  United  States,  in</span><span>  accordance  with  thc  terms  of  the  Bland  Silver</span></p> <p><span>  Bill,  to  tho  European  Powers  to  assemble  in</span></p> <p><span>  conference  to  deliberate  on  thc  institution  of</span><span>  bi-mctallic  money,  and  on  the  nieaUB  of</span></p> <p><span>  securing  fixity  of  relative  value  between  gold  1</span><span>  and  silver,  have  (it  was  lately  intimated)  been  ?</span><span>  accepted  by  seven  of  their  number.  Germany,</span><span>  os  might  have  been  expected,  has  refused,  and</span><span>  England  seems  to  have  hesitated  whether  she</span><span>  ought  not  to  do  the  same.  Both  these</span><span>  countries  have  the  gold  standard;  and  as</span><span>  Germany  has  only  very  recently  adopted  it</span></p> <p><span>  she  would  stultify  herself  were  she  to  admit  j</span><span>  that  the  whole  question  might  be  thrown  open</span><span>  again,  as  would  be  the  case  were  sho  to</span><span>  accept  the  American  invitation  as  that  was</span></p> <p><span>  worded  at  the  first.

At  present,  however,  England  is  in</span><span>  some  perplexity,  owing  to  the  effects  produced</span><span>  in  India  by  the  depreciation  of  silver  ;  but  it</span><span>  seems  more  probable  she  will  turn  her  thoughts</span><span>  towards  extending  ber  gold  standard  to  India</span><span>  than  to  introducing  the  Indian  standard  in</span><span>  England.  France  aud  other  members  of  the</span><span>  Latin  union  may  more  consistently  deliberate</span><span>  on  thc  matter,  as  they  are  still  bi-mctallist.</span><span>  If  France,  however,  adopts  Boon-os  seems</span><span>  probable  may  bc  thc  case-the  gold  standard,</span><span>  thc  case  of  thc  bi-mctallists  will  receive  its</span><span>  death-blow.  There  can  bc  no  harm,  however,</span><span>  in  our  American  cousins  talking  the  matter</span><span>  over  with  as  many  responsible  representatives</span><span>  of  other  Powers  as  they  can  induce  to  come</span><span>  together  for  the  purpose,  and  the  British  Go-</span><span>  vernment  hos  acted  wisely  in  accepting  the</span><span>  American  invitation  in  the  end,  as  we  believe</span><span>  it  lias  done,  though  only  on  condition  of  the</span><span>  discussions  being  widened  out  considerably</span><span>  beyond  the  limits  that  were  originally  assigned</span><span>  to  them.

"<p><span>  StefgMmg  §  »Mit,</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  JULY  ll,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  question  of  rating  raines  for</span><span>  municipal  purposes  came  under  dis-</span><span>  cussion  in  the  Legislative  Assembly  on</span><span>  the  3rd  instant,  when  the  House  was  in</span><span>  Committee  on  the  Local  Government</span><span>  Bill.  The  question  is  a  difficult  one,</span><span>  but  we  believe  it  has  been  SA^^Î°^ï</span></p> <p><span>  ""¿IT""land  shall  be  ratable  property</span><span>  within  the  meaning  of  this  Act,  save  as</span><span>  is  next  hereinafter  excepted.""  And  then</span><span>  follows  ta  number  of  sub-clauses  specify-</span><span>  ing  certain  classes  of  property  which</span><span>  shall  be  exempted  from  rating.  In  the</span><span>  clause  as  originally  drafted,  ""mines""</span><span>  were  not  included  among  the</span><span>  exemptions,  although  it  is  found</span><span>  in  the  Victorian  Act  of  which</span><span>  this  bill  is  mostly  a  transcript.  Mr.</span><span>  Macrossan  moved  its  insertion,  when  the</span><span>  Attorney-General  said  the  word  raines</span><span>  had  been  left  out  advisedly.  There</span><span>  would,  he  stated,  be  great  difficulty  in</span><span>  rating  raines,  but  if  they  were  exempted,</span><span>  there  would  be  no  local  government  on</span><span>  goldfields  In  support  of  this  view</span><span>  he  called  attention  to  the  circum-</span><span>  stance  that  at  Gympie,  where  the</span><span>  greater  part  of  the  land  is  held</span><span>  under  mining  rights  and  gold  mining</span><span>  leases,  local  government  would  simply</span><span>  be  impracticable  if  the  amendment  ol</span><span>  the  member  for  Kennedy  were  carried.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  evident,  however,  that  the  Attor-</span><span>  ney-General,  in  attempting  to  provide</span><span>  the  means  of  raising  a  sufficient  local</span><span>  revenue  on  gold-fields  by  including</span><span>  mines  among  the  classes  of  property</span><span>  liable  to  be  rated,  proposed  a  course</span><span>  which,  instead  of  promoting  local</span><span>  government  on  goldfields,  would  have</span><span>  had  precisely  the  opposite  effect,  in</span><span>  some  sense,  a  mine  is  a  property</span><span>  similar  in  its  nature  to  that  of  a</span><span>  house,  but  there  are  also  very  mate-</span><span>  rial  differences  between  the  two.  With</span><span>  regard  to  a  mine,  it  is  impossible  to  deter-</span><span>  mine  what  is  its  real  value.  It  may  yield</span><span>  a  profit  of  J£I  0,000  in  one  year,  and  for</span><span>  some  years  afterwards  not  pay  working</span><span>  expenses,  and,  again,  a  rich  patch  may</span><span>  be  struck  recouping  the  proprietors  for</span><span>  past  losses;  or  a  mine  may  yield  splendid</span><span>  ?eturns,  and  after  a  time  partially</span><span>  jr  wholly  fail.  In  the  latter  contingency,</span><span>  he  mine  would  in  all  probability  con</span><span>  inue  to  be  worked  for  a  considerable</span><span>  itne  before  being  abandoned.  On  what</span><span>  suitable  principle,  then,  could  such</span></p> <p><span>  ï</span></p> <p><span>  property  be  assessed  for  the  purposes  of</span><span>  rating?  But  the  unreasonableness  of</span><span>  clause  177  as  it  originally  stood  in  this</span><span>  particular  will  be  more  apparent  when</span><span>  we  point  out  that  its  effect  would  be  not</span><span>  only  to  render  ""  mines  ""  liable  to  rating,</span><span>  but  also  gold-miner's  claims  held  under</span><span>  the  miner's  rights,  although  practically</span><span>  the  levy  of  rates  on  such  claims  would</span><span>  perhaps  be  impossible.  The  amendment</span><span>  of  Mr.  Macrossan's  was  therefore  much</span><span>  needed,  and  he  is  entitled  to  the  thanks  of</span><span>  the  mining  community  for  having  de-</span><span>  tected  a  serious  flaw  in  the  bill,  and  in-</span><span>  duced  the  House  to  rectify  it.</span></p> <p><span>  We  should  explain  that  the  term</span><span>  ""mine,""  as  defined  by  the  Victorian</span><span>  Act,  and  as  understood  by  Mr.</span><span>  Macrossan,  applies  only  to  what  is  under-</span><span>  neath  the  surface.  The  minc,  and  thc</span><span>  adjuncts  foi  carrying  it  on,  are  exempted,</span><span>  and  everything  else  connected  with  it</span></p> <p><span>  is  rated.  In  the  case  of  a  cotton</span><span>  mill,  it  is  not  customary  to</span><span>  rate  the  powers  of  production,  such</span><span>  as  spindles  and  engines,  but  only</span><span>  the  buildings  in  which  the  operations  are</span><span>  carried  on.  The  machinery  of  a  sugar</span><span>  mill  would  be  exempt  from  rating  whilst</span><span>  the  mill  itself  would  be  legitimate  ratable</span><span>  property.  In  a  case  tried  in  Victoria,  it</span><span>  was  decided  that  the  engine  and  battery</span><span>  of  a  mining  property  were  not  ratable,</span><span>  I  but  that  the  smithies  used  for  the  purpose</span><span>  of  sharpening  the  miner's  tools,  not</span><span>  being  necessary  adjuncts,  were  liable.</span></p> <p><span>  The  distinction  here  drawn  is  readily</span><span>  comprehensible.  A  mine,  as  above  de-</span><span>  fined,  cannot  fairly  be  classed  in  the</span><span>  same  category  as  a  farm,  or  a  factory,  or</span><span>  a  squattage,  or  a  plantation,  and  the</span><span>  amendment  exempting  ""mines""  from</span><span>  rates  does  not  confer  a  benefit  on  the</span><span>  miner  to  the  prejudice  of  other  classes</span><span>  in  the  community.  It  would  be  pre-</span><span>  posterous  to  treat  a  shaft  sunk  in  a  mine</span><span>  on  the  same  principle  as  improvements</span><span>  effected  on  a  farm.  A  shaft  costing</span><span>  ¿500  might  prove  utterly  useless,  and</span><span>  to  say  that  money  so  spent  enhances</span><span>  the  value  of  the  mine  according  to  the</span><span>  amount  of  the  money  expended,</span><span>  is  sheer  nonsense  ;  and  yet  this  view</span><span>  was  stoutly  maintained  by  an  hon.</span></p> <p><span>  pose,  and  that  purpose  is  no  longer</span><span>  carried  out,  then  the  building-becomes</span><span>  useless.  And  a  shaft,  it  was  contended,</span><span>  should  be  regarded  in  a  similar  way.  The</span><span>  analogy  is  not  very  clear.  A  building  is</span><span>  erected  for  a  definite  purpose,  and  is  a</span><span>  fixture  having  uses  the  value  of  which  is</span><span>  capable  of  assessment  ;  but  the  sinking</span></p> <p><span>  of  a  raining  shaft  is  a  work  of  a  purely</span><span>  speculative  kind.  It  may  yield'  «?</span><span>  return  on  the  outlay,  or  it  may  not  ;  and</span><span>  as  a  matter  of  fact  a  large  number,</span><span>  perhaps  even  a  majority,  of  the  shafts</span><span>  sunk  on  a  goldfield,  turn  out  to  be</span><span>  ""  duffers.""  But  supposing,  for  the  sake</span><span>  of  argument,  we  admit  that  a  shaft</span><span>  should  be  dealt  with,  for  rating  purposes,</span><span>  in  the  same  manner  as  is  customary  with</span><span>  house  property,  it  is  pure  assumption  to</span><span>  say  that  a  building  which  .has  beea</span><span>  erected  for  a  certain  purpose  and  be-</span><span>  comes  useless  because  it  is  no  lons*1</span></p> <p><span>  I  wanted  for  that  purpose,  is  /¿fl?f/</span></p> <p><span>  .jiable  to  be  rateOV  If  ^«'J^^L</span></p> <p><span>  T^n^Ba^^n^vm^hi^lSo^^^s^etnpo</span></p> <p><span>  rarily  unoccupied,  we  are  by  no  means</span><span>  sure  that  such  property  ought  to  pay</span><span>  rates  whilst  non-productive  to  the  owner  ;</span><span>  and  if  our  memory  serve  us  correctly,</span><span>  rates  are  not  leviable  in  such  cases  in  the</span><span>  mother  country.</span></p> <p><span>  On  a  review  of  the  whole  question,</span><span>  therefore,  we  come  to  the  conclusion</span><span>  that  the  arguments  in  favour  of</span><span>  the  rating  of  mining  property</span><span>  are  quite  untenable,  and  the  Assembly</span><span>  evidently  took  this  view,  as  Mr.  Griffith</span><span>  accepted  the  amendment  including</span></p> <p><span>  ""  mines""  in  the  list  of  exemptions.  The</span><span>  amendment,  as  adopted,  was  somewhat</span><span>  ambiguous,  but  this  defect  was  remedied</span><span>  by  the  addition  to  clause  177.  on  the</span><span>  motion  of  the  Attorney-General,  of  the</span><span>  proviso-""For  the  purpose  of  this</span><span>  section  and  the  following,  the  word</span><span>  '  mines  '  shall  not  include  the  surface  of</span></p> <p><span>  jh£__land,-&lt;«--buirCBngs  or  machinery</span><span>  ""  erected  thereon,  but  shall  include  all</span></p> <p><span>  minerals  and  machinery  below  thc  sur-</span><span>  face  of  the  land,  and  all  machinery  and</span><span>  other  things  necessary  for  the  purpose  of</span><span>  working  the  mines.""  It  will  be  observed</span><span>  that  the  principle  here  laid  down  with</span><span>  regard  to  mining  property  is  not  applic-</span><span>  able  to  goldfields  only,  but  to  mines  of</span><span>  all  descriptions.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Volunteers  of  both  Companies  meet  for</span><span>  parade  this  evening  at  the  usual  hour.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  annual  meeting  of  thc  members  of  the</span><span>  School  of  Arts  is  advertised  for  this  evening,</span></p> <p><span>  st  eight  o'clock.

Some</span><span>  of  the  views  were  very  attractive,  representing</span><span>  scenery  on  thc  Rhine,  statuary,  and  some</span><span>  comic  scenes  intensely  amusing  to  the  specta-</span><span>  tors,  who  testified  their  pleasure  with  the</span><span>  beartinesa  peculiar  to  childhood.  Mr.  Hitch</span><span>  Jock  gave  the  explanatory  address  in  a  credit</span><span>  iblc  manner,  and  the  proceedings  were  varied</span><span>  iy  the  singing  of  liynins.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  JULY  25,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  report  of  the  Under-secretary  for  j</span><span>  Lands,  just  laid  before  Parliament,  con-</span><span>  tains  matter  of  considerable  interest  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  public.  We  do  not  here  intend  to  i</span><span>  review  the  report  generally  or  even  touch</span><span>  upon  all  its  most  interesting  points,  as  it</span><span>  would  be  impossible  to  do  either  within</span><span>  the  limits  of  one  article.  Our  purpose</span><span>  is  to  deal  with  the  alienation  question,</span><span>  with  especial  reference  to  the  working  of</span><span>  the  Act  of  1876.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Tully  dates  his  report  12th  June,</span><span>  1878,  but  deals  only  with  the  year  1877,</span><span>  during  ten  months  of  which  only  was  the</span><span>  Alienation  Act  of  the  previous  year  in</span><span>  force.  But  during  that  period  an  area  of</span><span>  nearly  three-quarters  of  a  million  acres</span><span>  was  selected,  which  is  more  than  was</span><span>  selected  in  any  one  year  under  the</span><span>  Act  of  1868.  This  was  chiefly</span><span>  the  consequence  of  a  very  large</span><span>  area  being  thrown  open  for  selection  ;</span><span>  but  it  partly  arose  probably  from  the</span><span>  advanced  price  imposed  on  all  newly</span><span>  opened  lands.  All  available  for  selec-</span><span>  tion  on  ist  March  1877,  remained  at  the</span><span>  old  price  of  five  shillings,  but  the  in-</span><span>  crease  put  upon  the  lands  thrown  open</span><span>  last  year  raised  the  average  price  of  the</span><span>  total  quantity  selected  under  conditional</span><span>  purchase  to  nine  shillings  pei  acre.  AU</span><span>  this  goes  to  prove  that  the  prices  which</span><span>  prevailed  latterly  under  the  1868  Act</span><span>  were  too  low,  and  that  the  country  was</span><span>  parting  with  its  landed  estate  at  an  enor-</span><span>  mous  sacrifice.  Five  shillings  per  acre,</span><span>  with  payment  spread  over  ten  years  is,  it</span><span>  must  be  remembered,  not  equal  to  more</span><span>  than  three  shillings  and  sixpence  cash  j</span><span>  and  we  quite  agree  with  Parliament  in  its</span><span>  conclusion,  that  if  the  good  lands  of  the</span><span>  colony  will  not  realise  more  than  that,</span><span>  they  had  better  not  be  forced  into  the</span></p> <p><span>  market.</span></p> <p><span>  With  this  feature  of  the  new  Act  the</span><span>  members  for  Aubigny  and  Toowoomba</span><span>  have  seriously  quarrelled.  There  is  a</span><span>  great  demand  for  Darling  Downs  lands,</span></p> <p><span>  and  the  Government  have  used  the</span><span>  power  conferred  upon  them  to  obtain  the</span><span>  best  prices  procurable.  Within  home-</span><span>  steads  the  selections  throughout  the</span><span>  colony  have  averaged  sixteen  shillings</span><span>  per  acre  ;  and  as  by  a  clause  in  the  Act</span><span>  the  entire  unalienated  portion  of  Darling</span><span>  Downs  was  proclaimed  a  homestead</span><span>  area,  the  advance  in  price  there  has  been</span><span>  to  double  and  often  quadruple  that</span><span>  obtained  under  the  1868  Act.  That  so</span><span>  sudden  an  increase  has  aroused  ex-</span><span>  pressions  of  local  dissatisfaction  is  not</span><span>  surprising,  for  persons  who  had  been</span><span>  awaiting  the  resumptions  naturally  felt</span><span>  disappointed  when  their  industry  was  so</span><span>  seriously  handicapped;  and  when  also</span><span>  they  found  that  those  who  settled  down</span><span>  upon  equally  good  lands  a  year  or  two</span><span>  previously  had  been  allowed  to</span><span>  do  so  at  one-half  and  some-</span><span>  times  at  one-fourth  the  charge  they</span><span>  were  now  called  upon  to  pay.  But</span><span>  unless  it  could  be  shown  that  men  willing</span><span>  to  pay  one  pound  per  acre  would  make</span><span>  a  less  beneficial  use  of  the  land,  we  fail</span><span>  to  discover  on  what  ground  they  could</span><span>  be  pushed  aside  to  confer  an  act  of  bounty</span><span>  upon  those  who  could  only  pay  five  shil-</span><span>  lings.</span></p> <p><span>  A  deputation  from  the  Darling  Downs</span><span>  recently  waited  upon  the  Government</span><span>  requesting  that  the  grievance  complained</span><span>  of  by  a  number  of  new  settlers  in  this</span><span>  respect  should  be  redressed.  It  was</span><span>  urged  that  while  they  had  paid  something</span><span>  like  thirty  shillings  per  acre  for  their</span><span>  homesteads,  they  had  not  been  favoured</span><span>  with  four  inches  of  rainfall  during  the</span><span>  past  season,  while  other  parts  of  the  same</span><span>  district  had  been  blessed  with  from  twelve</span><span>  to  fifteen  inches.  The  argument  to  be</span><span>  deduced  appears  to  be  that  these  pooi</span><span>  men  had  been  offered  inducements  by</span><span>  the  State  to  settle  in  an  arid  district,  and</span><span>  fleeced  by  being  asked  prices  wholly</span><span>  beyond  the  intrinsic  value  of  the</span><span>  land.  But  this  mode  of  reasoning</span><span>  could  not  be  admitted  for  an  instant</span><span>  The  inducements  offered  did  not  so</span><span>  much  proceed  from  the  Government  as</span><span>  from  the  selectors'  self-constituted  advo-</span><span>  cates,  who  first  cracked  up  ""  the  value  ol</span><span>  Darling  Downs  lands,  and  then  wished</span><span>  them  given  away  to  the  ""poor  man.""</span><span>  This  doctrine  no  doubt  furnished  the</span><span>  materials  for  a  successful  electioneering</span><span>  campaign,  but  it  could  only  be  accepted</span><span>  by  doing  a  grievous  injustice  to  the</span><span>  general  public.  The  lands  are  held  in</span><span>  trust  by  the  Government  for  the  public</span><span>  good,  and  it  has  never  yet  been  proved</span><span>  that  by  giving  them  away  they  would  be</span><span>  more  beneficially  utilised  than  by  sell-</span><span>  ing  them.  Just  as  it  is  easier  for  any</span><span>  man  to  save  the  second  hundred  pounds</span><span>  than  the  first,  so  it  seems  to  us  it  is  pro-</span><span>  bable  that  the  man  able  to  pay  the</span><span>  market  price  is  more  likely  to  possess</span><span>  both  the  means  and  will  to  improve</span><span>  his  estate  than  the  man  would  be  who</span><span>  had  not  money  to  buy,  but  who  still</span><span>  wished  to  start  on  his  own  account</span><span>  in  the  business  of  farming  or  stock-raising.</span></p> <p><span>  Most  reen  would  like  to  start  in  business</span><span>  on  their  own  account,  but  it  would  be  a</span><span>  poor  investment  for  the  State  to  devote</span><span>  its  resources  to  supplying  all  such  men</span><span>  with  the  money  requisite  for  such  start.</span><span>  If  such  a  system  were  adopted  at  all,  it</span><span>  would  be  sounder  policy  to  assist  those</span><span>  who  had  already  started  and  proved  the</span><span>  genuineness  of  their  metal,  but  who</span><span>  found  themselves  paralysed  by  the  want  ol</span></p> <p><span>  sufficient  means.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  unnecessary  to  deny  that  the</span><span>  recent  Darling  Downs  selectors  have</span><span>  made  a  bad  investment,  but  surely  thal</span></p> <p><span>  is  not  a  question  for  the  Government  to</span><span>  consider.  If  they  are  wanting  the</span><span>  necessaries  of  life,  then  Jet  relief  be  given  ;</span><span>  but  simply  because  a  disastrous  season</span><span>  has  made  their  speculation  a  bad  one</span><span>  temporarily,  surely  no  one  in  his  right</span></p> <p><span>  senses  would  ask  the  Stale  to</span></p> <p><span>  alter  the  terms  of  their  contract.  They</span><span>  entered  upon  it  with  their  eyes  open,</span><span>  and  had  they  not  done  so  many  others</span><span>  would  have  been  ready  to  supply  their</span><span>  places.  As  well  might  every  Govern-</span><span>  ment  contractor  demand  compensation</span></p> <p><span>  for  the  loss  sustained  in  carrying  out  his  ,</span><span>  contract,  and,  if  the  demand  were</span></p> <p><span>  refused,  make  a  political  grievance  of  the  !</span></p> <p><span>  refusal.  Were  selectors  the  only</span><span>  class  in  the  community,  their  complaint</span><span>  might  receive  favourable  consideration  ;</span><span>  but  seeing  that  more  than  justice  can</span><span>  only  be  done  to  them  at  the  expense  of</span><span>  other  classes,  their  grievance  must  be</span><span>  pronounced  one  which  no  Government,</span><span>  however  liberally  disposed,  could  seri-</span><span>  ously  entertain.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Tully  points  out  that  competition</span><span>  by  auction,  in  the  event  of  a  plurality  of</span><span>  applications  for  the  same  piece  of  land,</span></p> <p><span>  has  not  been  often  resorted  to.  ""In</span></p> <p><span>  cases  where  selections  clash,""  he  says,</span><span>  ""there  is  afforded  an  opportunity  be-</span><span>  tween  the  time  of  application  and  the</span><span>  Commissioner's  Land  Court,  for  the  rival</span><span>  applicants  to  arrange  who  shall  have  the</span><span>  land-one  of  them  retiring  when  the</span><span>  Commissioner  deals  with  the  applications,</span></p> <p><span>  and  is  fined  £1  for  non-attendance,  while  I</span><span>  the  selection  of  the  other  is  approved,  |</span><span>  he  being  the  sole  applicant.""  This  de-  j</span><span>  feats  the  intention  of  the  bill,  no  doubt,  !</span><span>  but  it  is  probably  not  a  more  objection-</span></p> <p><span>  able  proceeding  than  the  use  of  the  ballot,  ¡</span><span>  which  imports  an  unwholesome  gambling</span><span>  element  into  the  business  of  land  selec-</span><span>  tion.  As  it  is,  speculators  may  rind  the</span><span>  auction  system  a  means  of  levying  black</span><span>  mail  upon  men  who  really  want  the  land</span><span>  for  bonâ  fide  settlement  ;  but  it  is  impos-</span><span>  sible  to  legislate  effectually  against  an</span><span>  abuse  of  that  nature.  Speaking  of  the</span><span>  auction  system,  in  its  application  to  an</span><span>  area  of  20,000  acres  of  first-class  land  re-</span><span>  cently  obtained  by  exchange  at  Allora,  Mr.</span><span>  ?  Tully  says  :-""  At  present  popular  senti-</span><span>  ment  is  opposed  to  the  sale  of  lands  by</span><span>  auction,  whilst  if  it  is  declared  open</span><span>  to  selection  it  will  probably  be</span><span>  acquired  by  homestead  selectors  at</span><span>  two  shillings  and  sixpence  per  acre.</span><span>  There  is,  of  course,  a  provision</span><span>  for  submitting  to  competition  simultane-</span><span>  ous  applications  for  homesteads  ;  but  it</span><span>  is  questionable  whether  an  adequate  ptice</span><span>  will  be  realised  for  these  lands  in  that</span><span>  way.  I  take  it  the  object  of  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  is  to  encourage  agricultural  settle-</span><span>  ment  in  that  part  of  the  district  which  is</span><span>  proved  to  be  suitable  for  wheat  cultiva-</span><span>  tion,  and  at  the  same  time  secure  a  fair</span><span>  value  for  the  land.  It  is  doubtful,  how-</span><span>  ever,  whetherthese  results  can  be  attained</span><span>  by  the  present  act.""  And  yet  Mr.  Tully</span><span>  just  afterwards  says  that  ""up  to  the</span><span>  present  time  the  Act  has  worked</span><span>  smoothly,  and  is,  I  think,  a  fair  one  for  the</span><span>  colony  generally.""  This  language  looks</span><span>  to  us  paradoxical  ;  but  possibly  Mr.</span><span>  Tully  means  to  convey  that  the  ""object</span><span>  of  the  Government""  cannot  be  attained</span></p> <p><span>  by  any  Act  that  .would  be  ""fair  to  the</span><span>  colony  generally?'  We  suspect  that  the</span><span>  true  policy  is  to  get  the  highest  price,  for</span><span>  the  man  who  has  paid  dearly  for  land</span><span>  will  not  be  able  to  afford  to  let  it  lie</span><span>  unproductive.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court,  yesterday,  before  the</span><span>  Police  Magistrate,  there  was  only  one  case  on</span><span>  the  sheet,  that  of  Thomas  Ayling  Kingston</span><span>  v.  Robert  William  Lawson,  for  sureties  of</span><span>  the  peace.  Mr.  H.  Milford,  who  appeared  for</span><span>  the  complainant,  applied  to  withdraw  the  in-</span><span>  formation,  to  which  the  Bench  acceded.  The</span><span>  question  of  costs  was  reserved  until  to-morrow</span><span>  morning.  Mr.  C.  S.  V.  Melbourne  appeared</span></p> <p><span>  for  the  defence.</span></p> <p><span>  As  a  benefit  society,  thc  Oddfellows  have</span><span>  earned  a  name  for  excellence  throughout  thc</span><span>  English-speaking  world,  and  the  branch  of  the</span><span>  institution  in  Rockhampton  is  in  no  respects</span><span>  behind  in  the  enterprise  and  progress  dis-</span><span>  played  by  older  lodges  in  the  larger  Australian</span><span>  towns.  Its  business  affairs  seem  to  be  con-</span></p> <p><span>  ducted  in  such  a  manner  as  generally  to  end</span><span>  in  a  profit-a  striking  illustration  of  how  much</span><span>  more  wisely  men  spend  their  own  earnings</span><span>  than  those  of  others.  For  some  years  the</span><span>  Oddfellows  of  Rockhampton  have  had  a  hall,</span><span>  which  bas  been  equal  to  their  requirements</span><span>  until  lately,  when  such  extensive  alterations</span><span>  have  been  made  that  the  present  structure</span></p> <p><span>  I  looks  as  if  it  waa  an  entirely  new  building.</span></p> <p><span>  Yet,  true  to  economy,  two  of  the  walls</span><span>  of  thc  old  structure  form  part  of  tho</span><span>  new,  and  -  the  materials  that  had  to</span><span>  be  displaced  were  not  lost.  The  present</span><span>  building,  which  will  formally  opened  by  a</span><span>  banquet  to-night,  is  a  credit  not  only  to  the</span><span>  Oddfellows,  but  to  the  town.  The  ground</span><span>  story  of  the  facade  is  in  thc  Tuscan  order  cf</span><span>  archtecture,  and  the  upper  story  a  composite</span><span>  of  the  Grecian  and  Roman-Ionic.  About  the</span><span>  entrance  is  the  name  of  the  bnilding,</span><span>  surmounted  by  the  society's  device,  the</span><span>  open  hand  and  heart.  Tho  appearance  of</span><span>  the  front  give»  an  impression  of  Btrength  and</span><span>  elegance.  The  plastering  and  finishing  work</span><span>  has  been  carefully  done,  and  reflects  credit  on</span><span>  the  contractor  for  that  portion  of  the  work.</span><span>  On  each  side  of  the  entrance  hall,  which  it</span><span>  lighted  with  gas,  is  a  small  ante-room,</span><span>  ten  feet  by  eight.  Passing  through</span><span>  thc  entrance  hall,  on  inner  doorway</span><span>  admits  to  thc  large  hall,  which  is</span><span>  sixty  feet  long  hy  twenty-nine  feet  »-ide  ;  the</span><span>  walls  aiu  seventeen  feet  high,  and  twenty-nino</span><span>  feet  from  the  floor  to  the  centre  of  thc</span></p> <p><span>  roof.  This  room  is  lighted  np  with  two  sun-</span><span>  lights,  and  is  capable  of  scating  from  350  to</span><span>  400  people.  From  the  entrance  hall,  a  stair-</span><span>  case  leads  to  an  upper  room  twenty-nine  feet</span><span>  by  thirteen,  walls  ten  feet  high,  which  will  be</span><span>  used  ne  a  District  Chamber.  This  room  will</span><span>  also  bc  useful  as  a  ladies'  dressing  room  when</span><span>  thc  largo  hall  is  used  as  a  ball-room.  Hie  car-</span><span>  penter  work  was  carried  out  by  Messrs.  Holmes</span><span>  and  Lee.  At  thc  banquet  this  evening,  it  ia</span><span>  understood  tliat  presentations  are  to  he  made</span><span>  to  Mr.  15.  B.  Moyle,  l'.O.M.,  for  MB  efforts  in</span><span>  furtherance  of  the  objects  of  Oddfcllowehip  itt</span><span>  Rockhampton.  The  alterations  have  been</span><span>  carried  out  under  thc  supervision  of  Mr.  J.  W.</span><span>  Wilson,  architect,  and  their  cost  amounts  to</span><span>  £900,  the  property  being  now  valued  ot  £1200.</span><span>  The  Oddfellows  are  to  be  congratulated  on  the</span><span>  character  of  the  building  they  have  raised,  and</span><span>  the  energy  they  have  shown  gives  promise  of</span><span>  the  still  greater  success  of  their  order  in  the</span><span>  Central  distriot.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  dramatic  entertainment  last  night  in  j</span><span>  tlie  Derby-street  School-room,  in  aid  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  funds  ot  the  Catholic  Total  Abstinence  Society,  j</span><span>  drew  a  good  attendance.  The  amateurs  were</span></p> <p><span>  fairly  up  in  their  parts,  and  acquitted  them-  '</span><span>  selves  croditably,  receiving  hearty  applause,  j</span><span>  The  farce,  ""Tho  Town  Barber,""  caused  great</span><span>  merriment,  and  tho  audience  went  home  in</span><span>  good  humour.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  AFTEE  DARK  ""  was  repeated  last  night  at</span><span>  the  Theatre  Boyal.  The  piece  ran  more</span><span>  smoothly  than  on  the  preceding  night,  and</span><span>  evoked  repeated  and  hearty  plaudits.  Mr.</span><span>  Vincent  deserves  credit  for  his  scene  painting,</span><span>  which  is  artistic  and  varied.  The  orchestra</span></p> <p><span>  also  materially  aids  in  the  success  of  the  per-</span><span>  formances,  Mr.  Eugarde's  violin-playing  being</span><span>  especially  pleasing.

The</span><span>  communication  was  obtained  from  Hawkwood,</span><span>  245  miles  from  the  town,  where  two  telephones,</span><span>  owned  by  Mr.  Morrison,  an  arrival  per  Kapunda,</span><span>  were  attached  to  the  line,  Mr.  Langley  using</span></p> <p><span>  bis  own  at  this  end.  When  the  three  instru-</span><span>  ments  were  placed  in  circuit,  a  cooey  was</span><span>  transmitted,  which  was  distinctly  heard.  A</span><span>  similar  call  was  repeated  nt  the  other  end,  and</span><span>  space  seemed  to  he  annihilated,  for  the  sound</span><span>  wes  plainly  distinguishable.  Singing  was</span><span>  also  plainly  audible.  Our  old  blind  friend</span><span>  who  discourses  mechanical  music  oppo-</span><span>  site  thc  hotel  establishments  of  thc  town</span><span>  was  plying  his  ""grinder""  with  his  usual</span><span>  industry,  somewhat  to  the  annoyance  of</span><span>  thc  operators  at  this  end  of  the  line;  but  it</span><span>  might  be  said  in  this  instance  that  ""  distance</span><span>  lent  enchantment  to  the  sound,""  for  the</span><span>  Hawkwood  operator  says  that  he  heard  the</span><span>  muBi'c  distinctly,  and  doubtless  duly  ap-</span><span>  preciated  it.  It  is  somewhat  singular  that</span><span>  although  musical  soiuida  were  distinctly  audible</span><span>  at  Hawkwood,  words  were  not  distinct,  which</span><span>  Mr.  Langley  partly  accounts  for  by  the  fact  that</span><span>  the  communication  was  confused  by  the</span><span>  writing  from  another  line  working  at  the  time</span><span>  with  Brisbane,  and  which  was  caught  on  the</span><span>  telephone.  Mr.  Langloy  intends  to  repeat  ex-</span><span>  periments  on  Sunday,  when  the  lines  will  be</span><span>  clear,  in  which  case  even  more  successful</span><span>  recolta  may  be  anticipated.</span></p> <p><span>  THU  plans  for  the  new  Municipal  Chambers</span><span>  shadow  forth  a  substantial  and  economical</span><span>  building.  Excluding  the  verandah  the</span><span>  structure  is  to  be  seventy  feet  in  length  by</span><span>  thirty-three  iu  width.  The  room  for  the</span><span>  Council  meetings  is  thirty-two  feet  hy  twenty  ;</span><span>  its  length  within  the  studding  being  the</span><span>  breadth  of  the  main  building.  On  one  Bide</span><span>  of  the  entrance  to  the  Municipal  Chamber  are</span></p> <p><span>  rooms  for  the  Town  Clerk  and  the  Bate</span><span>  Collector  ;  and  on  the  other  side  is  the  Town</span><span>  Surveyor's  room,  Each  of  these  rooms  is</span><span>  twenty  feet  by  sixteen,  which  will  be  a  great</span><span>  improvement  on  the  pigeon  boxes  in  which</span></p> <p><span>  those  officers  have  to  transact  thir  business</span></p> <p><span>  at  present.  Behind  the  Town  .Surveyor's</span><span>  room  is  the  Mayor's  Office,  sixteen  feet  by</span><span>  twelve,  and  behind  the  Town  Clerk's  and</span><span>  Bate  Collector's  rooms,  arc  the  office</span><span>  for  the  Inspector  of  Nuisances,  thc</span><span>  lumber  roora,  and  the  strong  room,</span><span>  Thc  room  for  the  Nuisance  Inspector  is  twelve</span><span>  by  eleven,  the  lumber  room  twelve  by  ten,</span><span>  and  the  strong  room  ten  by  eight.  The  lattei</span><span>  room  will  be  built  with  brick  fourteen  inches</span><span>  thick,  and  will  contain  the  valuable  town  re</span><span>  cords.  By  the  original  plan  a  ten-feet  veran&lt;</span><span>  dali  was  to  go  round  three  sides,  but  by  a  re</span><span>  solution  of  thc  Council  the  verandah  is  now  tc</span><span>  surround  the  building,  which  will  be  very</span><span>  beneficial  to  the  back  rooms,  as  well  os  to  tbi</span><span>  Council  meeting  room.  An  inspection  of  tbi</span><span>  plans  will  satisfy  the  most  discontented  rate</span><span>  payer,  that  utility  and  economy  have  beer</span><span>  kept  steadily  in  view.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  following  particulars  have  been  kindlj</span><span>  furnished  by  the  Chief  Officer  of  the  Victoria,</span><span>  s.s.  The  steamer  cast  off  from  the  Cnstomi</span><span>  boat  at  the  Johnston  river  at  9  a.m.  on  thc</span><span>  21st  instant  on  her  trip  from  the  north,  and</span><span>  at  2  a.m.  sighted  two  small  boote  under  sai</span><span>  close  to  the  land  at  the  south-east  end  o</span><span>  Hinchinbrook  Island,  heading  out  ti</span><span>  sea.  The  helm  was  ported  and  tin</span><span>  steamer  made  towards  them.  It  turnee</span><span>  out  to  be  part  of  the  shipwreckei;</span><span>  crew  of  tho  French  barque  Success,  which  wai</span><span>  totally  lost  on  July  8,  on  on  unknown  sunkei</span><span>  reef,  lying  from  seventy  to  eighty  miles  north</span><span>  north-east  of  Russell  Island.  The  vessel  wai</span><span>  hound  from  Kole,  a  port  in  Japan,  to  Mel</span><span>  bourne  with  a  cargo  of  rice,  and  struck  on  thi</span><span>  reef  about  eleven  at  night.

The  captain  and  six  o</span><span>  the  crew  were  in  the  boats  for  thirteen  days</span><span>  and  a  distance  of  1000  miles  was  traversed</span><span>  during  which  they  suffered  very  much  fron</span><span>  want  of  provisions  and  water;  tho  ema!</span><span>  quantity  they  saved  before  the  vessel  wen!</span><span>  down,  was  wetted  with  the  snit  water  and  hoi:</span><span>  to  bc  dried  in  the  sun.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTO^^</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  JULY  17,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  WHEN  in  our  telegraphic  abstract  of  the</span><span>  proceedings  of  the  Legislative  Assembly</span><span>  on  .  the  Local  Government.  Bill,  it  was</span><span>  stated  that  the  Committee  had  passed</span><span>  the  objectionable  loan  and  other  clauses,</span><span>  we  were  not  a  little  surprised.  But  re-</span><span>  ceipt  of  the  Hansard  report  gives  an</span><span>  explanation,  which,  if  not  satisfactory,</span><span>  quite  accounts'  for  the  erratic  course</span><span>  honorable  members  appear  to  have  taken.</span><span>  The  mischievous  clauses  were  dealt  with</span><span>  in  a  very  thin  House,  and  but  imper-</span><span>  fectly  discussed.  We  some  weeks  since</span><span>  feared  this  would  be  the  result  of  a  mori-</span><span>  bund  Parliament  attempting  to  deal</span><span>  with-  important  matters  of  legislation,  and</span><span>  it  now  appears  as  though  the  chief  result</span><span>  of  the  current  session  would  be  to  add  to</span><span>  the  list  of  statutes  which  it  will  be  found</span><span>  necessary  to  repeal,  or  at  least  amend,</span><span>  next  year.  In  our  Assembly,  municipal</span></p> <p><span>  business  never  attracts  much  notice  from</span></p> <p><span>  the  general  body  of  members.  It  refers</span><span>  to  far  too  prosy  a  matter  of  everyday  life</span><span>  to  excite  party  spirit,  or  induce  most</span><span>  honorable  members  to  bestow  serious</span><span>  attention  upon.  Yet  the  Local  Govern-</span><span>  ment  Bill  now  before  Parliament  directly</span><span>  affects  the  interests  of  all  owners  of  town</span><span>  properties,  and  affirms  principles  which</span><span>  may  trench  considerably  on  the  rights</span><span>  and  privileges  of  son-municipal  colonists.</span><span>  Indeed,  it  is  a  measure  of  very  great  im-</span><span>  portance,  and  as  such  demands  the  care,</span><span>  practical  knowledge,  and  legislative  skill</span><span>  of  the  people's  representatives.  Instead,</span><span>  it  is  left  to  the  Government,  one  or</span><span>  two  leaders  of  the  Opposition,</span><span>  and  a  few  of  the  town  members;</span><span>  and  consequently  the  Attorney-General</span><span>  is  thrusting  the  bill  on  the  country  with</span><span>  nearly  all  its  original  blemishes  un-</span><span>  touched.  Mr.  Mcilwraith  put  his  finger</span><span>  on  several  blots  the  other  night,  but  the</span><span>  House  was  so  thin  that  he  dared  not</span><span>  call  for  a  division  lest  the  result  should</span></p> <p><span>  be  a  ""count-out,""  and  the  loss  of  the  j</span><span>  j  bill.  This  responsibility  he,  as  leader  i</span></p> <p><span>  '  of  the  Opposition,  did  not  care  to</span></p> <p><span>  accept,  and  accordingly  there  is  fair</span></p> <p><span>  prospect  of  the  measure  being  passed  !</span></p> <p><span>  in  an  unworkable  or  injurious  shape.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  ,9th  instant,  clause  177  was  '</span><span>  amended  in  such  a  manner  as  to  pro-</span><span>  vide  that  the  annual  value  of  rateable</span><span>  lands  should  be  the  reasonable  rent</span><span>  they  might  be  estimated  to  produce,</span><span>  after  allowing  ""the  probable  annual</span><span>  average  cost  of  insurance  and  other  ex-</span><span>  penses  (if  any),  necessary  to  maintain</span><span>  said  property  in  a  state  to  command</span><span>  such  rent,""  provided  that  the  annual</span><span>  value  of  any  rateable  property  shall  not</span><span>  be  less  than  eight  per  cent  on  the</span><span>  capital  value  thereof;  and  that  pastoral</span><span>  land  shall  be  rated  on  their  annual  and</span><span>  not  capital  value.  A  further  proviso  to</span><span>  the  effect  that  in  a  city  no  land  shall  be</span><span>  rated  at  a  less  value  than  ^""25  per  acre</span><span>  was  withdrawn.  This  was  ostensibly</span><span>  the  present  law,  differently  expressed,</span><span>  but  on  Mr.  Thompson  pointing  out  that</span><span>  the  last  proviso  would  be  oppressive  on</span><span>  owners  of  horse  paddocks,  it  was  with-</span><span>  drawn.  The  Attorney-General  stated</span><span>  the  object  to  be  that  no  piece  of  land</span></p> <p><span>  should  be  rated  at  less  than  ten  shillings</span><span>  annually,  but  a  fifty-acre  paddock  would</span><span>  have  been  rated  at  ,£«00  a-year,  and</span><span>  the  owner  required  to  pay  £5  annually,</span><span>  and  this  the  House  appeared  to  think  too</span></p> <p><span>  much.  But  as  we  understand  the  amend</span></p> <p><span>  ,  ment.theexisting  provisionfixingthemini</span><span>  mum  rate  payable  on  any  allotment  at  ten</span><span>  shillings  will  be  abrogated  by  the  With-</span><span>  drawal  of  the  proviso.  If  this  be  the</span><span>  case,  the  expense  of  collecting  rates  on</span><span>  properties  of  small  value  will  be  more</span><span>  than  they  are  worth.  Wc  cannot,  there-</span><span>  fore,  regard  the  new  clause  as  an  im-</span><span>  provement.</span></p> <p><span>  Under  clause  198,  a  rate  may  be</span><span>  amended  by  the  Council.  The</span><span>  Attorney-General  stated  that  the  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  Council  had  recommended  that</span><span>  the  power  be  conferred  upon  the  Town</span><span>  Clerk,  The  Committee,  however,  de-</span><span>  clined  to  adopt  the  suggestion,  as  they</span><span>  also  did  another  from  the  same  source</span><span>  to  the  effect  that  where  the  owner  was</span><span>  required  to  pay  rates  in  default  of  the</span><span>  occupier,  the  notice  should  be  advertised</span><span>  in  the  Gazette  and  one  local  newspaper.</span></p> <p><span>  On  tíause^i^;TiraWng  tmpair]-raîes-a</span></p> <p><span>  charge  upon  property,  Mr.  Hockings</span></p> <p><span>  raised  a  discussion  in  the  interests  of</span></p> <p><span>  absentee  proprietors,  and  he  moved  an</span><span>  amendment  striking  out  the  eight  per</span><span>  cent  chargeable  on  rates  in  arrear.  The</span><span>  suggestion  met  with  little  sympathy,  how-</span><span>  ever,  although  Mr.  Walsh  remarked  that</span><span>  he  had  paid  in  rates  more  than  the</span><span>  capital  value  of  allotments  during  the</span><span>  last  twenty  years.  Objections  were  also</span><span>  taken  to  the  vesting  of  property  in  thc</span><span>  municipality  on  which  the  rates  were</span><span>  unpaid  for  a  period  of  thirty  years,  but</span><span>  here  again  the  absentee  was  shown  no</span><span>  mercy.</span></p> <p><span>  The  greatest  contention  arose,  how-</span><span>  ever,  on  the  borrowing  clauses.  Mr.</span><span>  Fraser  very  properly  objected  to  the  pro-</span><span>  vision  requiring  a  special  rale  to  be</span><span>  levied  for  payment  of  interest  upon</span><span>  borrowed  money.  Mr.  M'llwraith  also</span><span>  strongly  objected  to  this  clause,</span><span>  as  well  as  to  those  enabling</span><span>  twenty  ratepayers  to  demand  a</span><span>  a  plebiscitum,  and  precluding  the</span><span>  borrowing  of  money  from  any  lender  but</span><span>  the  Government.  The  latter  provision</span><span>  excited  most  opposition,  but  all  three</span><span>  were  carried  nevertheless,  without</span><span>  division-the  reason  being,  as  already</span><span>  stated,  that  a  quorum  of  members  not</span><span>  being  in  attendance  the  bill  would  have</span><span>  j  been  jeopardised  by  any  attempt  to</span><span>  I  divide  the  House.</span></p> <p><span>  As  to  these  points  we  have  already</span><span>  expressed  a  decided  opinion.  The  least</span><span>  objectionable  of  the  three  is  that  which</span><span>  prevents  municipalities  from  borrowing</span><span>  outside  the  Government,  as  it  is  not</span><span>  likely  to  have  any  practically  bad  effect.</span><span>  Nearly  every  municipality  will  be  but  too</span><span>  glad  to  borrow  of  the  Government  at</span><span>  i  five  or  six  per  cent,  and  had  the  pro</span></p> <p><span>  [  vision  been  simply  to  prevent  a  second</span><span>  mortgage,  it  would  have  been  less</span><span>  objectionable,  although  even  then  we</span><span>  should  fail  ta  perceive  its  utility  ;  for  if</span><span>  a  private  -capitalist,  knowing  that  the</span><span>  revenues  of  a  municipality  were  already</span><span>  mortgaged,  chose  to  lend  it  money,  he</span><span>  would  do  so  with  his  eyes  open  and  be</span><span>  deserving  of  little  sympathy.  The</span><span>  Colonial  Secretary  of  New  South  Wales</span><span>  takes  precisely  the  opposite  view  to  that</span><span>  adopted  by  our  Assembly,  for  he  de-</span><span>  cidedly  objects  to  Government  advancing</span><span>  money  to  municipalities,  on  the  ground</span><span>  that  the  practice  is  certain  to  involve</span><span>  political  comiption.</span></p> <p><span>  It  appears  to  us  that  these  loan  re-</span><span>  strictions  are  a  blunder,  and  that  the</span><span>  object  aimed  at  might  have  been  attained</span><span>  far  more  legitimately  and  effectively.  The</span><span>  course  of  proceedure  should  have  been</span><span>  this  :-Compel  every  municipal  council</span><span>  before  applying  to  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  for  a  loan  to  make  an  estimate  of</span><span>  the  works  intended  to  be  carried  out,</span><span>  precisely  in  the  same  manner  as  they  are</span><span>  required  to  make  their  annual  estimate  ;</span></p> <p><span>  -such  estimate  be  forwarded  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  Treasurer  along  with  their  application.</span><span>  Then  let  a  Government  inspector  visit</span><span>  the  municipality,  thoroughly  investigate</span><span>  its  financial  position,  and  report  fully  to</span><span>  the  Governor-in-Council  thereupon-a</span><span>  copy  of  such  report  being  laid  before</span><span>  Parliament,  after  having  been  before  the</span><span>  municipal  council,  in  order  that  the  local</span><span>  representatives  might  be  armed  with  any</span><span>  additional  facts  calculated  to  throw  light</span><span>  upon  it,  or,  if  necessary,  vindicate  the</span><span>  fiscal  position  of  the  municipality.  By</span><span>  this  means,  the  Government  and  Legis-</span><span>  lature  would  be  in  the  position  to  judge</span><span>  of  the  value  of  the  security  offered,  and</span><span>  the  safety,  or  otherwise,  of  the  desired</span><span>  loan.  The  protection  to  the  public  ob-</span><span>  tained  by  this  method  would  consist  in</span><span>  its  publicity,  for  no  Government  would</span><span>  dare  place  money  in  the  Estimates  to</span><span>  obtain  political  support  when  the  security</span><span>  offered  was  plainly  shown  to  he  inade-</span><span>  quate.  The  restrictions  imposed  by  the</span><span>  clauses  as  passed,  needlessly  curtail  the</span><span>  liberty  and  derogate  from  the  indepen-</span><span>  dence  of  municipalities,  and  we  yet  hope</span><span>  they  will  be  superseded  by  more  rational</span><span>  provisions  before  the  bill  passes  through</span><span>  the  Upper  House.  If  not,  amending</span><span>  legislation  will  be  found  requisite  next</span></p> <p><span>  year.</span></p> <p><span>  In  clause  233,  making  councillors</span><span>  liable  for  borrowing  in  excess  of  their</span><span>  powers,  there  is  the  fatal  objection  that</span><span>  it  throws  the  onus  on  the  wrong  party.</span><span>  It  is  the  Government  who  should  be  pre-</span><span>  cluded  from  lending  beyond  the  amount</span><span>  which  a  municipality  is  entitled  to  claim.</span><span>  There  is  the  further  objection,  too,  that</span><span>  it  is  a  clause  which  might  subject  coun-</span><span>  cillors  to  penalties  for  inadvertence  or</span></p> <p><span>  mistake.</span></p> <p><span>  We  regret  these  pa!f  able  defects  in  an</span><span>  otherwise  excellent  measure  ;  and  on  the</span><span>  whole,  are  much  inclined  to  doubt</span><span>  whether  hasty  legislation  of  this  nature</span><span>  will  be  found  of  real  benefit  to  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  THERE  was  a  poor  attendane  last  night  at</span><span>  the  Theatre,  on  the  occasion  of  ""The  Duke's</span><span>  Motto""  being  repeated.

The  Brisbane  Telegraph  says</span><span>  that  on  the  night  of  the  25th  June  an  attack</span><span>  wa«  made  on  the  gens-d'année,  commanded  by</span><span>  MODS.  Lecas,  who  made  a  vigorous  defence,</span><span>  and  himself  brought  down  eight  of  the  as-</span><span>  sailants  with  hi«  own  Chassepot  rifle.  After</span><span>  seeing  hi«  wife  and  children  killed  by  the</span><span>  weapons  of  the  savage«,  he  fled  to  Tono,  and</span><span>  thence  to  Noumea.  The  powerful  native</span><span>  chief  Atai,  who  is  the  instigator  of  the  revolt,</span><span>  has  never  recognised  the  occupation  oi</span><span>  New  Caledonia  by  tho  French.  Few</span><span>  colonists  reside  at  La  Foa,  but  .  many</span><span>  at  Bouloupari.  As  the  resident«  at  the</span><span>  two  places  are  nearly  related,  the  emotion  was</span><span>  very  great  when  the  news  arrived  that  a  war</span><span>  of  extermination  against  the  whites  had  com-</span><span>  menced,  and  that  all  ages  and  sexes  had  been</span><span>  attacked.  A  despatch  boat  arrived  at  Nou-</span><span>  mea  on  Wednesday,  bringing  refugees,  includ-</span><span>  ing  many  women  and  children,  who  had  been</span><span>  awakened  in  the  night.  A  strong  feeling  of</span><span>  commiseration  prevailed,  and  a  desire  for  re</span><span>  revenge  not  less  .strong.  Another  account</span><span>  says  that  160  person«  have  been  killed,</span><span>  or  are  dying,  at  Derarnelles  station.</span><span>  On  the  24th  and  26th  June  the  natives</span></p> <p><span>  rose  cn  masse  and  attacked  the  gens-d'armeB</span><span>  at  La  Foa,  of  whom  they  killed  five,</span><span>  and  succeeded  in  recapturing  the  chiefs.</span><span>  Having  tasted  blood  they  announced  their</span><span>  intention  of  marching  to  Bouloupari.  While</span><span>  ou  the  way  to  that  place,  the  savages  murdered</span><span>  all  who  came  in  their  way,  and  a  horrible</span><span>  massacre  ensued,  neither  men,  women,  chil-</span><span>  dren,  gens-d'armes,  nor  oonvicta  being  spared  ;</span><span>  the  wretches  winding  up  by  mutilating  their</span><span>  victims  and  burning  their  property.  The</span><span>  «cene  was  indescribably  horrible.  Active</span><span>  steps  were  at  once  taken,  and  the  military</span><span>  sent  out  against  the  savages,  with  orden  to</span><span>  make  no  captive«  but  kill  all  they  came  across.</span><span>  Amongst  the  murdered  Europeans  well  known</span><span>  in  tho  Australian  colonies  are  Mr.  Markham,  of</span><span>  Queensland  ;  Miss  Camey,  of  Sydney,  Mrs.</span><span>  'Conteely  and  her  husband  ;  Madame</span><span>  Courvoisier,  and  Mr.  John  Henderson.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  the  discussion  on  the  Beti  mates  (as  re-</span><span>  ported  in  Saturday's  Homard)  with  regard  to</span><span>  a  grant  to  the  Children's  Ho  ipitaL  Brisbane,</span><span>  some  observations  were  made  on  hospitals</span><span>  throughout  the  colony,  and  especially  that  of</span><span>  Rockhampton.  Mr.  Palmer  considered  the</span><span>  ladies  of  Brisbane  had  made  a  mistake  in</span><span>  coming  to  the  Government  for  assistance.</span><span>  ""  With  regard  to  the  Rockhampton  Hospital,</span><span>  he  wished  to  point  out  that,  instead  of  allow-</span><span>  ing  the  Committee  to  spend  the  money  voted</span><span>  for  an  additional  wing  according  to  their  own</span><span>  ideas,  he  understood  that  plans  had  liccn  sent</span><span>  up  which  were  considered  utterly  unsuitable.</span><span>  A  little  non-interiorence  from  the  S  ecretary</span><span>  for  Works  in  that  case  would,  he  thought,</span><span>  have  been  better.

The  Premier,  .Mr.</span><span>  Morehead,  and  Mr.  Low  spoke  on  the  s  ubject,</span><span>  and  in  replying,  Mr.  Miles  said,  with  respect</span><span>  to  the  Rockhampton  Hospital,  that  ""he  heard</span><span>  for  the  first  time  the  complaints  referr  ed  to  by</span><span>  the  hon.  member  for  Port  CurtiB.  He  was  so</span><span>  well  satisfied  with  the  way  in  which  ''the  com*</span><span>  rnjttee  of  that  hospital  had  conducted  theil</span><span>  affairs,  that  he  would  have  been  qui'  »  willing</span><span>  to  hand  over  the  money  to  them.

Mr.  W.

Arthur</span></p> <p><span>  Bradford,  formerly  one  of  the  resident  surgeons</span><span>  of  the  Melbourne  Hospital,  surrendered  in  the</span><span>  Equity  Court,  Melbourne,  on  the  12th  instant.</span><span>  He  is  charged  with  contempt  of  court  in</span><span>  having  eloped  with,  and  married,  a  ward  of</span><span>  the  court,  Miss  Elisabeth  M'Robie  Ware,  in</span><span>  July,  1876.  Dr.  Bradford  and  Miss  Ware</span><span>  fled  to  New  Zealand.  The  young  lady  was,</span><span>  at  the  time  of  the  elopement,  nineteen  years</span><span>  of  age,  and  was  a  boarder  at  the  school  of</span><span>  Mrs.  Tietley,  on  the  Dandenong  Hoad,  St.</span><span>  Kilda.  Miss  Ware's  father,  who  was  a</span><span>  squatter  in  oue  of  the  western  districts,  had</span><span>  died  intestate  some  years  before  his  daughter's</span><span>  marriage,  leaving  an  estate  valued  at  £300,000,</span><span>  of  which  £200,000  was  left  to  bis  widow  and</span><span>  five  childreu.  Miss  Elizabeth  M'Robie  Ware</span><span>  had  become  entitled  to  £111,000  of  this  estate,  -</span><span>  On  the  arrival  of  the  young  lady  and  Dr.</span><span>  Bradford  in  New  Zealand,  they  were  married,</span><span>  and  have  since  resided  in  that  colony.  Judge</span><span>  Molesworth  stopped  Mrs.  Bradford's  supplies</span><span>  in  1875  as  a  warning  to  fortune  hunters,  and</span><span>  declared  her  husband  guilty  of  contempt  of</span></p> <p><span>  court.  Dr.  Bradford  ha«  returned  to  Victoria</span><span>  for  the  purpose  of  allowingthe  Court  to  deal</span><span>  with  him  on  this  charge.

The  estimated  total  of</span><span>  the  crop  is  about  four  hundred  tons,  being</span><span>  considerably  below  the  producing  capacity  of</span><span>  the  plantation,  a  fact  we  believe  attributable</span><span>  in  a  great  measure  to  the  time  of  year,  and</span><span>  the  numerous  difficulties  with  which  the</span><span>  manager,  Mr.  Walker,  had  to  contend  when</span><span>  resuming  charge  of  the  estate  on  behalf  the</span><span>  proprietor.  The  clean  condition  of  the  fields</span><span>  and  the  healthy  appearance  of  the  numerous</span><span>  varieties  of  canes  afford  a  good  evidence  of  the</span><span>  care  which  has  charaterised  the  management</span><span>  and  speak  hopefully  for  the  results  of  the</span><span>  crushing.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  SEPTEMBER  C,  1878.</span></p> <p><span>  A  CR  EDITARLE  desire  has  been  shown</span></p> <p><span>  by  the  Queensland  Parliament  to  give</span><span>  all  reasonable  aid  to  the  development  of</span><span>  the  mineral  resources,  more  especially</span><span>  the  gold  deposits,  of  the  colony.  Re-</span><span>  wards  are  given  for  the  discovery  of</span><span>  payable  goldfields,  and  exploring  parties</span><span>  have  from  time  io  time  been  sent  out,</span><span>  wholly  or  partly  at  the  Government  ex-</span><span>  pense,  in  search  of  gold  and  other</span></p> <p><span>  minerals  of  commercial  value.  The</span></p> <p><span>  public  expenditure  thus  incurred  has,  we</span><span>  think,  been  justified  by  the  results.  Thc</span><span>  Government  have  also  called  into  requi-</span></p> <p><span>  sition  the  services  of  scientific  men  to</span><span>  examine  and  report  upon  the  geologi-</span><span>  cal  characteristics  of  the  country,</span><span>  keeping  in  view  the  value  of  minerals</span><span>  the  discovery  of  which  would  help  to</span><span>  sustain  a  large  population  and  promote</span><span>  the  colony's  prosperity.  We  cannot</span><span>  speak,  however,  with  confidence  of  the</span><span>  benefits  secured  by,  or  likely  to  accrue</span><span>  from,  these  scientific  investigations</span><span>  not  that  such  investigations  at  the  public</span><span>  expense  are  in  themselves  undesirable,</span><span>  but  rather  because  they  have  been  con-</span><span>  ducted  in  a  faulty  manner,'  and  no  pro-</span><span>  per  steps  are  being  taken  to  ensure  the</span></p> <p><span>  utilisation  of  the  information  obtained.</span></p> <p><span>  Some  years  ago,  the  late  Mr.  Daintree</span><span>  made  some  very  important  geological</span><span>  investigations  in  Central  and  Northern</span><span>  Queensland,  and  they  were  preserved  in</span><span>  official  reports  as  records  of  the  State  ;</span><span>  but  where  are  these  now  to  be  obtained,</span><span>  -and  what  steps  have  ever  been  taken  to</span><span>  bring  those  documents  under  the  notice</span><span>  of  miners  and  capitalists  who  would  be</span><span>  likely  to  turn  the  information  to  account</span><span>  and  to  open  up  our  mineral  riches  ?</span><span>  These  reports  are  supposed  to  be  kept</span><span>  on  sale  at  the  Government  Printing</span><span>  Office,  but  they  appear  to  be  out  of</span><span>  print;  at  any  rate,  we  can  speak</span><span>  positively  with  regard  to  Mr.  Daintree's</span><span>  report  on  the  Rockhampton  district</span><span>  which  is  notât  present  obtainable,  and  no</span></p> <p><span>  steps  are  taken  to  provide  additional-'</span><span>  copies.  That  report  was  perhaps  jjneof</span></p> <p><span>  the  most  valuable  of  the  kind  which  has</span></p> <p><span>  been  made  in  this  colony.  _Mt^Dainlree</span><span>  was  a  geologist  of  distinguished  ability,</span><span>  and  in  his  examination  of  this  district,</span><span>  he  was  fortugate""in  being  accompanied</span></p> <p><span>  by  Mr.^jölrich,  then  Government  Mine-  ;</span><span>  ralpgist  of  Victoria,  who  engaged  in  the</span><span>  .JWork  with  a  keen  interest  and  gave  Mr.</span><span>  Daintree  the  benefit  of  his  opinions,</span><span>  some  of  which  were  embodied  in  the</span><span>  report.  The  general  conclusion  arrived</span><span>  by  those  two  gentlemen  was  that  in</span><span>  the  district  comprised  within  a  radius</span><span>  of  from  thirty  to  fifty  miles  of  Rock-</span><span>  hampton,  the  combination  of  rocks  is  ot</span></p> <p><span>  the  most  favourable  character  for  the</span><span>  production  of  gold,  copper,  and  other</span><span>  minerals  of  commerce.  They  also  took</span><span>  notice  of  particular  localities  where</span><span>  special  inducements  seemed  to  present</span><span>  themselves  for  mining  explorations.  The</span><span>  district  was  at  that  time  supporting  a</span><span>  mining  population  numbering  from</span><span>  3000  to  4000  souls,  and  various  alluvial</span><span>  gold  workings  and  quartz  reefs  were  open</span><span>  to  inspection  below  the  surface  and  were</span><span>  carefully  examined.  But  the  alluvial  after-</span><span>  wards  became  exhausted,  and  the  reefs,</span><span>  which  had  been  shamefully  mismanaged</span><span>  through  the  inexperience  of  miners,</span><span>  were  in  course  of  time  neglected  in</span><span>  favour  of  the  more  alluring  gold  dis-</span><span>  coveries  of  Gympie,  Charters  Towers,</span><span>  and  the  Palmer.  The  extensive  pre-</span><span>  valence  of  cupriferous  deposits  in  this</span><span>  part  of  the  colony  is  also  well  known  ;</span><span>  and  since  Mr.  Daintree's  visit,  outcrops</span><span>  of  copper  ore  have  been  experimented</span><span>  upon  at  the  Dee  and  other  localities,  but</span><span>  have  been  abandoned  chiefly  on  account</span><span>  of  the  low  price  of  copper  and  the  general</span><span>  disinclination  manifested,  since  the  mining</span><span>  mania  of  1872,  for  mining  investments</span><span>  which  do  not  promise  an  immediate</span><span>  return.  But  the  temporary  desertion  of</span><span>  this  district  in  favour  of  newer  fields,  by</span><span>  no  means  proves  that  its  mineral  deposits</span><span>  will  not  repay  a  judicious  employment  of</span><span>  labour  and  capital  in  their  development  ;</span><span>  and,  judging  from  the  wealth  which  has</span><span>  been,  already  unearthed  in  the  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  district,  we  may  confidently</span><span>  forward  to  mining  in  this  part  of  the</span><span>  colony  again  coming  into  favour  at  no</span><span>  distant  date  with  miners  and  capitalists,</span><span>  who  will  go  to  work  in  a  systematic  way</span><span>  and  reap  a  liberal  reward  for  their</span><span>  outlay.</span></p> <p><span>  The  report  of  Mr.  Daintree  on  this</span><span>  district  had,  as  we  have  already  hinted,</span><span>  an  additional  value  imparted  to  it  from</span><span>  the  fact  that  Mr.  Ulrich  accompanied</span><span>  him  in  his  examinations  and  gave  him</span><span>  the  benefit  of  his  opinions  and  ex-</span><span>  perience.  This  assistance  was  rendered</span><span>  gratuitously,but  was  nonetheless  valuable</span><span>  on  that  account.  And  we  think  it  would</span></p> <p><span>  be  an  improvement  if  in  future  explora-</span><span>  tions  of  this  kind,  carried  on  at  the  ex-</span><span>  pense  of  the  colony,  a  man  skilled  in</span><span>  mineralogy  and  thc  practical  knowledge</span><span>  of  mining,  were  paid  to  accompany  the</span><span>  geologist,  so  that  scientific  investigations</span><span>  would  be  supplemented  and  followed  up</span><span>  by  those  of  a  more  practical  character.</span><span>  In  this  manner  the  work  would  he</span><span>  more  effectively  prosecuted,  and  would</span><span>  therefore  be  more  economical,  although</span><span>  more  costly.</span></p> <p><span>  At  thc  present  time,  there  are  two</span><span>  geologists  in  the  pay  of  the  Government.</span><span>  Mr.  A.  C.  Gregory  is  assumed  to  act  in</span><span>  that  capacity  for  (he  southern  portion  of</span><span>  the  colony,  and  Mr.  Jack  for  the  northern</span><span>  pDrtion.  We  have  no  reason  to  doubt</span><span>  the  ability  of  these  gentlemen  as  scien-</span><span>  tific  men,  but  we  have  serious  doubts</span><span>  of  the  public  utility  of  their  geological</span><span>  researches.  Certainly  nothing  has  as  yet</span><span>  been  made  public  which  would  tend</span><span>  to  _  show  thal  the  salaries  they</span></p> <p><span>  receive  are  bringing  in  an  equivalent</span><span>  return  to  the  colony.  With  regard  to</span><span>  Mr.  Gregory,  his  appointment  may  per-</span><span>  haps  be  considered  as  a  sinecure-or</span><span>  rather,  as  a  means  by  which  he  has  been</span><span>  removed  from  the  Lands  Office,  (where</span><span>  he  had  the  character  of  being  an  obstruc-</span><span>  tive),  and  by  which  he  has  virtually  been</span><span>  placed  on  pension  as  an  old  public</span><span>  servant  entitled  to  more  than  ordinary</span><span>  consideration.  We  shall  not,  therefore,</span><span>  look  for  much  work  from  him  as  a  geolo-</span><span>  gist.  With  Mr.  Jack,  however,  the  case</span></p> <p><span>  is  somewhat  different.  The  northern</span><span>  districts  are  remarkably  prolific  in  mine-</span><span>  rals,  and  the  last-named  gentleman  has</span><span>  been  brought  out  from  the  old  country</span><span>  under  engagement  to  the  Government</span><span>  on  a  good  salary,  to  pioneer  the  way</span><span>  and  assist  the  miner  in  turning  those</span><span>  mineral  resources  to  account.  He  had,</span><span>  we  believe,  a  high  reputation  at  home,</span><span>  and  is  doubtless  skilled  in  geological</span><span>  formations,  the  age  of  rocks,  the  character</span><span>  of  the  flora,  and  other  questions  coming</span><span>  legitimately  within  the  province  of  a</span><span>  geologist.  But  if  our  information  be</span><span>  correct,  he  is  wanting  in  the  knowledge</span><span>  which  is  most  useful  to  the  mineral</span></p> <p><span>  explorer  and  miner,  aud  his  laborious</span><span>  investigations  and  voluminous  reports</span><span>  will  be  found  absolutely  useless  as  an</span><span>  aid  to  the  developmeut  of  thc  mineral</span><span>  riches  of  the  country  where  he  is</span><span>  pursuing  his  studies.  He  is,  in  fact,</span><span>  wanting  in  that  quality  of  mind  which</span><span>  is  commonly  distinguished  by  the</span><span>  term  practical.  .  It  is  extremely</span><span>  probable,  however,  that,  if  accom-</span><span>  panied  by  a  gentleman  of  exten-</span><span>  sive  experience  in  mineralogy  and  the</span><span>  actual  work  of  mining  as  carried  on  in</span><span>  various  parts  of  the  world,  his  scientific</span><span>  knowledge,  which  is  now  of  little  service,</span><span>  might  be  turned  to  useful  account.</span></p> <p><span>  But  it  is  hardly  worth  while  to  procure</span><span>  information  regarding  the  mineral  re-</span><span>  sources  of  the  country,  unless  means  are</span><span>  taken  to  make  it  readily  accessible.  We</span><span>  have  the  Queensland  Annexe,  in  London,</span><span>  the  Museum  in  Brisbane,  and  two  or</span><span>  three  museums  in  embryo  in  various</span><span>  parts  of  the  colony.  But  these  efforts  at</span><span>  display  will  little  avail  unless  some</span><span>  trouble  is  taken  to  make  them  complete</span><span>  and  effective.  The  various  scientific</span></p> <p><span>  and  mining  reports,  illustrated  by  maps</span></p> <p><span>  and  mineral  specimens,  togetherjvitli  àH-J</span><span>  oilier  procurable  infjpHHalîôn  in  the</span><span>  hands  of  the  Government  respecting  our</span><span>  mineral  resources,  should  be  assiduously</span><span>  collected  a.n'd  set  before  the  public.</span><span>  The  ^metropolitan  museum  is  at  pre</span><span>  senfchiefly  filled  with  mineral  specimens.</span><span>  ,'d)d  we  would  suggest  that  when  the</span></p> <p><span>  building  in  course  of  erection  for  that</span><span>  institution  is  ready  for  occupation,  there</span><span>  should  be  rooms  set  apart  for  mining</span><span>  reports,  maps,  and  specimens,  under  the</span><span>  control  of  the  Minister  for  Mines,  where</span><span>  visitors  could  at  once  obtain  all  the</span></p> <p><span>  information  procurable  regarding  the</span><span>  mineral  districts  of  the  colony.  All</span><span>  this  could  be  done  without  much  addi-</span><span>  tional  expense  ;  and  unless  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  are  prepared  to  adopt  some  measure</span><span>  of  this  kind,  they  had  better  consider  the</span><span>  propriety  of  dismissing  the  geologists,</span><span>  andsavingthe  country  the  amount  of  their</span><span>  salaries.

The</span><span>  victim  of  this  cold-blooded  deed  and  the</span><span>  would-be  assassin  are  natives  of  thc  ""  flowery</span><span>  land,""  rejoicing  in  the  names  of  Sam  Tin  and</span><span>  Jim  Ah  Foy.  It  appears  that  Sam  Tin  had  a</span><span>  case  in  the  Petty  Debts  Court  against  Sun</span><span>  Sun  Yoon's  manager,  Jock  Sing,  for  thc</span><span>  recovery  of  thc  sum  of  £10,  alleged  to  have</span><span>  been  received  by  Jock  Sing  for  Sam  Tin's</span><span>  usc.  Tlie  victim,  Jim  Ah  Foy,  was  a  witness</span><span>  for  the  defence.  Thc  case  was  decided  by  the</span><span>  {?laintiff  being  non-suited.  Shortly  after  the</span></p> <p><span>  lairing  of  the  case,  thc  defendant  and  witness</span><span>  were  preceding  dowu  Gray-street  when  Som</span><span>  Tin  came  up  with  them,  and  when  nearing</span><span>  James  E.  Maund's  store,  words  having  ensued</span><span>  between  Sam  Tin  and  Jock  Sin,  tho  former</span><span>  drew  a  revolver  and  deliberately  fired  at  the</span><span>  latter,  thc  contents  completely  riddling  a  hand-</span><span>  kerchief  his  hand  contained,  and  also  slightly</span><span>  grazed  the  hand.  Jim  Ah  Foy  endeavoured</span><span>  to  seize  Sam  Tin,  but,  losing  his  hold,  Sam</span><span>  Tin  with  his  loft  arm  secured  him  by  tho</span><span>  neck,  and  fired  three  times  in  quick  succession</span><span>  into  his  face,  two  bullets  taking  effect,  one</span><span>  penetrating  zogoma  aud  thc  other  entering  the</span><span>  corner  of  thc  eye.  At  this  juncture  and  just</span><span>  as  Sam  Tin  was  about  to  fire  again,  he  was</span><span>  bravely  seized  by  several  licrsons  who  had</span><span>  arrived  on  tho  spot,  handed  over  to  thc</span><span>  police,  whilst  his  victim  was  carried  to  Sun</span><span>  Sun  Yoon's  store,  where  Dre.  Maxton  and</span><span>  Denis  quickly  attended  him.  It  was  suggested</span><span>  to  take  him  to  tho  hospital,  but'  the  Chinese</span><span>  preferring  to  take  care  of  him  themselves,  he</span><span>  was  left  in  their  keeping.  He  is  unconscious</span><span>  and  lies  in  a  very  precarious  state,  the  bullets,</span><span>  which  were  somewhat  email,  still  remaining</span><span>  in  him.  The  medical  men,  while  holding  out</span><span>  but  slight  hopes  of  his  recovery,  state  that</span><span>  he  may  possibly  linger  for  a  few  days.  Sam</span><span>  Tin,  who  is  an  intelligent  man,  was  lately  a</span><span>  resident  ot  Tingha,  and  has  recently  been</span><span>  working  some  mineral  land  at  Skeleton  Creek.</span></p> ",Article,1878-09-06,"The morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

Their</span><span>  Constitution  stipti  ales  that  there  shall</span><span>  not  be  more  than  me  representative  for</span><span>  every  30,000  pei  ¡ons.  In  1872  the</span><span>  electoral  unit  was  ncreased  to  130,000.</span><span>  in  Queensland,  at  the  taking  of  the  last</span><span>  census  in  187G  we  had  forty-three</span><span>  members  to  173,100  persons,  or  one</span><span>  member  to  everj  4023.  lt  does  not</span><span>  follow  therefore  th  it  á  system  suited  to</span><span>  America  would  bi  adapted  for  Queens-</span><span>  land.  Out  assu  ning  that  there  is  a</span><span>  general  desire  for  assimilation,  as</span><span>  nearly  as  citcut  istanccs  permit,  the</span><span>  first  duty  of  our  Parliament  will  be  to</span><span>  create  electoral  istricts  corresponding</span></p> <p><span>  to  thc  States  in  America.  There  the</span><span>  total  population  lumbers  38  millions</span><span>  distributed  tliroii]  h  thirty-seven  stales.</span><span>  Here  we  have  17;  ,000  spread  over  forty</span><span>  three  electoral  1  istricts.  It  is  plain</span></p> <p><span>  therefore  that  jefore  the  American</span></p> <p><span>  system  can  be  a  iplicd  to  Queensland</span><span>  there  must  be  a  fusion  of  electorates.</span><span>  If  thirty-seven  e  ectoral  districts  are</span><span>  sufficient  for  the  Jnited  Slates,  fourteen</span><span>  would  be  ample  br  Queensland,  which</span><span>  would  require  ead  three  of  our  electorates</span><span>  to  be  thrown  inti  one.
