"<p><span>  /Horning  ^Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  DECEMBER  28,  194ß.</span></p> <p><span>  MAINLY  MEANDERING</span></p> <p><span>  Being  the  last  for  the  year,  this</span><span>  Saturday  article  was  intended  to</span></p> <p><span>  have  risen  to  lofty  moral  and</span><span>  philosophical  heights,  whence  ta</span><span>  outshine  the  51  others  that</span><span>  marched  through  this  column  into</span><span>  the  downy  shades  of  the  past.  The</span><span>  intention  was  not  to  waste  admoni-</span><span>  tory  discourse  over  the  well-worn</span><span>  heels  of  1946  as  they  departed</span><span>  through  thc  back  door  to  that</span><span>  I  tourne  whence  no  year,  be  it  good</span><span>  or  bad,  ever  returned;  but  like</span><span>  Tallyrand  the  arch-diplomat  to</span><span>  meet  incoming  1947  with  a  wealth</span><span>  of  text  and  precept,  so  that</span><span>  did  it  go  astray  it  would  clearly</span><span>  be  no  fault  of  ours.  Tallyrand</span></p> <p><span>  never  wasted  tears  over  a  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  credited  French  king  sneaking  out</span><span>  by  the  back,  when  he  could  be</span><span>  smiling  a  welcome  on  an  incoming</span><span>  king  who  was  thundering  at  thc</span></p> <p><span>  front  door.</span></p> <p><span>  That  inflexible  purpose  persisted</span><span>  until  the  flood  of  Christmas  senti-</span><span>  ment,  which  swept  irresistibly</span><span>  through  shops  and  ships  and  planes</span><span>  and  trains  and  post  and  telegraph</span><span>  offices,  which  filled  the  streets  and</span><span>  beckoned  people  into  shops,  which</span><span>  sparkled  on  every  sunbeam  and</span><span>  fringed  every  cloud,  which  carried</span><span>  a  wave  of  pessimism  into  count-</span><span>  less  fowl  runs,  and  ended  by  bear-</span><span>  ing  off  most  of  the  city's  popula-</span><span>  tion  to  disport  itself  on  the  moist</span><span>  fringe  bf  the  Pacific,  invaded  alsc</span></p> <p><span>  the  editorial  den.  Then-but  what</span></p> <p><span>  is  the  use  of  trying,  on  the  face  ot</span><span>  it,  to  moralise  to  or  on  a  nen</span><span>  year  from  amid  the  ruins  of  a</span><span>  Christmas  '  feast,  or  deputising  foi</span><span>  Janus  for  the  edification  of  a  de-</span></p> <p><span>  parted  audience  ?  It  is  even  an  open</span><span>  question  that  they  would  hav(</span><span>  heeded  had  they  stayed,  and  how</span><span>  much  less  would  they  do  so  when</span><span>  absent,  either  in  the  body  or  In</span><span>  the  spirit?  In  other  words,  the</span><span>  ""seasonal  spirit""  gripped  us  with</span><span>  the  virulence  of  three-day  sickness,</span><span>  for  while  others  escaped  to  mingle</span><span>  their  ""seasonal  spirit""  with  salt</span><span>  water  and  sunburn  and  sand,  it</span><span>  was  our  lot  to  keep  guard  over  an</span><span>  empty  city  surrendered  by  its</span></p> <p><span>  owners  to  furtive  cats  and  unsus-</span><span>  pecting  country  folk  who  came  to</span><span>  spend  Christmas  Day  amid  the</span><span>  bright  lights  of  the  city.  They</span></p> <p><span>  know  better  now.</span></p> <p><span>  A  London  colleague  wrote  on</span><span>  like  occasion  that  ""the  only  eye»</span><span>  that  are  likely  to  survey  thia</span><span>  column  are  those  of  the  printer  and</span><span>  the  half-dozen  solicitors'  clerks  who</span></p> <p><span>  watch  me  for  libeL""  He  went  on</span></p> <p><span>  to  say  that  all  he  had  to  do  to</span><span>  keep  faith  with  his  column  was  to</span><span>  ""string  1000  or  so  words  together</span><span>  in  some  sort  of  order  that  approxi-</span><span>  mates  to  sense  and  does  not  arouse</span><span>  litigosity,""  after  which  the  city</span><span>  waa  his.  In  this  respect,  apparently,</span><span>  little  separates  London  and  Rock-</span><span>  hampton.</span></p> <p><span>  Then  came  welling  up  through</span><span>  the  spirit  that  is  seasonal  that</span><span>  greatest  of  inspirations-here  was  a</span><span>  heaven-sent  chance  to  do  something</span><span>  with  that  literary  task  that  had</span><span>  hung  fire  for  just  such  an  occasion.</span><span>  The  task  is  too  expansive  to  be</span><span>  cribbed  within  any  four  walls,  so</span><span>  heigh-ho  for  the  greensward  under</span><span>  a  shady  tree  -with  comfortable</span><span>  table  and  chair  and  cool  drinks</span><span>  within  call.  That  theme  would  be</span></p> <p><span>  developed  from  an  Arcadian  pin-</span><span>  point  in  limitless  space  would  be</span><span>  routed  from  the  mind  and  set  in</span><span>  I  precise  order  on  paper,  and,  unlike</span></p> <p><span>  the  model  over  which  the  painter</span><span>  dreamed'for  20  years  when  he  had</span><span>  grown  old  and  so  at  his  deaih  he</span><span>  left  only  a  blank  canvas,  it  would</span><span>  be  given  to  a  posterity  that  would</span><span>  live  only  to  bless  us.</span></p> <p><span>  But  the  shady  tree  and  green-</span><span>  sward  and  table  and  chair  and</span></p> <p><span>  writing  material  and,  cool  drinks</span><span>  are  merely  the  grosser  impedi-</span></p> <p><span>  menta  to  the  translation  of  un-</span></p> <p><span>  spoken  thought.  The  Horatian  pre'-:</span><span>  cept  ""Begin  at  once""  is  the  liaison</span><span>  '  between  mind  and  matter,  so  with</span></p> <p><span>  squared  elbows  the  first  page  is</span><span>  numbered  and  the  voyage  of  en-</span><span>  chantment  into  literary  creative-</span><span>  ness  is  begun,  then  a  flower</span><span>  drifts  down,  from  tree  to  table  as</span><span>  if  to  challenge  one  to  refute  the</span><span>  Wordsworthian  concept  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  meanest  flower  that  blows  can</span><span>  inspire  thoughts  which  lie  too</span><span>  deep-for  work.  Striving  grimly</span><span>  not  to  lose  the  fight  in  the  first</span><span>  round  we  try  to  hold  fast  to  the</span><span>  majesty  of  our  theme  against  this</span><span>  tiny  manifestation  of  Nature  until,</span><span>  prompted  by  memory,  upsurges  the</span><span>  devout  thought  ""Flowers  are  the</span><span>  thoughts  of  God,""  when  it  was</span><span>  the  most  shameless  presumption  to</span><span>  interpose  our  thoughts  between  His.</span><span>  Raleigh  could  not  have  known  of</span><span>  this,  else  he  would  not  have  caused</span><span>  his  shepherd  to  demean  violets  by</span><span>  describing  them  as  ""pretty</span><span>  daughters  of  earth  and  sun""  and</span></p> <p><span>  When  we  awoke  a  butcher  bird,</span><span>  impudent,  assertive  and  vibrant</span></p> <p><span>  with  initiative  looked  down  dis-</span><span>  dainfully  from  the  tree  upon  the</span><span>  numbered,  unspoiled  page.  He</span><span>  answered  in  clear,  flute-like  notes</span><span>  his  distant  mate,  hopped  and  turned</span><span>  rn  mid-air  -  can  any  other  bird</span><span>  do  this?-and  sat  in  his  former</span><span>  seat.  He  then  grumbled  musically</span><span>  at  our  inaction  and  soon  hurried</span><span>  off-a  songful  assassin-either  to</span><span>  fill  the  countryside  with  melody</span><span>  or  to  empty  the  nest  of  some  other</span><span>  bird  of  its  nestlings.</span></p> <p><span>  With  the  return  of  consciousness</span></p> <p><span>  came  that  mood  of  quiet  despera-</span><span>  tion  in  which  much  good  work  gets</span><span>  itself  belatedly  done,  and  with</span><span>  rising  hopes  we  recall  the  agent</span></p> <p><span>  who  said  to  his  faint-hearted</span></p> <p><span>  author  ""Of  course  ni  get  you  £100</span></p> <p><span>  advance  on  that  novel-To  show</span></p> <p><span>  you  how  persuasive  I  am  I'll  get</span><span>  you  £300.""  A  round  of  telephone</span><span>  rings  followed  until  he  came  upon</span><span>  a  publisher-  who,  taken  off  his</span><span>  guard,  agreed  to  the  advance.</span><span>  Hanging  up  the  receiver  the  con-</span><span>  science-stricken  agent  turned  to</span><span>  the  astonished  author  and  groaned</span><span>  ""My  stars  !

It  was  an  ailing  child,  heit</span><span>  to  all  the  woes  of  infancy  when</span><span>  the  foster  parents  are  strangers  tc</span><span>  thc  cult;  but  it  brightened  up  when</span><span>  the  first  World  War  that  had  put</span><span>  .out  of  business  Russia-the  major</span><span>  producing  country-and  had  all</span><span>  ihe  other  Allie«  fully  employed</span><span>  training  young  and  old  ideas  how</span><span>  and  when  to  shoot.  The  revival  was</span><span>  short-lived,  however,  for  the  acre-</span><span>  age  dropped  from  16Ü0  acres  in</span><span>  1919  to  a  tenth  of  that  ten  years</span><span>  later.

Nor  were  they</span><span>  averse  to  calling  it  hemp,  of  gal-</span><span>  lows  notoriety,  to  which  end  thc</span><span>  prospectus,  named  it  ""New  Zealand</span><span>  flax  (or  hemp),  destined  to  become</span><span>  Ute  nation's  most  valuable  fibre</span><span>  plant.""  even  while  the  Imperial</span><span>  Institute,  London,  was  speculating</span><span>  upon  its  economic  future.  One  sug</span><span>  '  gestion  was  that  it  be  pulped  along</span><span>  with  wood,  as  a  base  for  artificial</span></p> <p><span>  silk.  ;</span></p> <p><span>  Cut  off  from  world  supplies  the</span></p> <p><span>  Empire  turned  to  growing  its  own</span><span>  flax,  and  the  industry  in  Victoria</span><span>  soared  to  dizzy  heights  under  the</span><span>  impulse  of  war-time  urgency  and</span><span>  fiuance.  The  area  under  flax  in</span><span>  1942-3  was  56,740  acres  which</span><span>  yielded  47,511  tons  of  straw.

Meanwhile  the</span><span>  loading  of  the  4^00,000  bales  of</span><span>  .double-dumped  wool  will  continue.</span><span>  No-one  is  likely  to  quibble  at  these</span><span>  terms,  but  what  every  common</span><span>  sense  person  will  ask  is  why  it</span><span>  was  necessary  to  tie  up  120  ships</span><span>  for  12  days  and  throw  12,000  men</span><span>  idle  in  order'  to  ensure  the  adop-</span><span>  tion  of  a  simple  procedure?  Surely</span></p> <p><span>  one  of  the  industrial  tribunals  or</span><span>  a  responsible  Minister  could  have</span><span>  done  the  same  thing  and  avoided</span><span>  loss  to  anyone.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr  Forde  accompanies  the  an-</span><span>  nouncement  of  temporary  settle-</span><span>  ment  with  some  reasons  that</span></p> <p><span>  might  be  open  to  challenge,  if  it</span><span>  would  serve  any  purpose  pending</span><span>  the  inquiry.  By  sub-division  and</span><span>  subtraction  he  has  worked  .  it  out</span><span>  that  only.  20  per  cent  of  Australia's</span><span>  total  wool  clip  is  affected,  ""and</span></p> <p><span>  therefore  this  small  «mount  could</span><span>  bot  be  allowed  to  hold  np  the  set-</span><span>  tlement  of  the  dispute  and  override</span><span>  public  interest.""  Conversely  it</span><span>  might  be  advanced  that  since  only</span><span>  20  per  cent  of  the  clip  hr  affected</span><span>  it  was  no  justification  for  the</span><span>  wharf  labourers  to  hold  up  all  ship-</span><span>  ping.  For  a  man  of  his  Jong  experi-</span><span>  ence  in  public  life  the  Acting</span><span>  Prime  Minister  can  ""  be  singularly</span><span>  blind  to  a  two-edged  argument.</span></p> <p><span>  The  news  that  the  wharf  strike</span></p> <p><span>  has  been  ""settled""  will  bring  no</span><span>  manifestation  of  relief,  such  as</span><span>  might  be  expected  at  the  lifting  of</span><span>  a  dark  shadow  that  threatened</span></p> <p><span>  grave  national  upset.  Nor  /is  thia</span><span>  surprising.  Like  most  others  of  its</span><span>  kind,  this  settlement  hos  been</span><span>  reached  so  readily  because  the</span><span>  strikers  have  once  more  got  all  they</span><span>  wanted  by  simple  recourse  to  direct</span><span>  action.  But  supposing  the  independ-</span></p> <p><span>  ent  tribunal  decides  that  double</span><span>  dumping  of  wool  is  not  .a  hardship</span><span>  on  wharf  workers,  and  is  necessary</span><span>  to  preservation  of  the  industry  and</span><span>  the  economy  of  the  country?  Will</span><span>  they  abide  by  the  decision?  Mr</span><span>  Forde  and  Senator  Ashley  would</span></p> <p><span>  have  done  well  to  secure  an  assnr</span><span>  ance  on  that  point  from  the  strik-</span><span>  ers.  They  had  no  need  to  secure  it</span><span>  from  the  wool  dumpers,  who  will</span><span>  ÜtßfjpSr  mayes  tb  conform  to  the  rul-</span><span>  ing,'Whatever  teinvorves:</span></p> <p><span>  If  anyone  imagines  a  decision  in</span><span>  favour*of  a,continuance  of  double</span><span>  dumping  will  be  accepted  by  the</span><span>  watereiders  they  should  first  'study</span></p> <p><span>  the  words  of  Mr  Healy  (Secretary</span><span>  of  the  Federation):  ""We  are  con-</span><span>  fident,""  he  said,  ""that  the  result</span><span>  of  the  inquiry  will  not  only  put  an</span><span>  end  to  the  practice  of  double  dump-</span><span>  ing  but  will  lead  to  a  reduction  in</span><span>  the  weight  of  a  number  of  ether</span><span>  items  of  cargo.""  The  first  part  of</span><span>  that  statement  flagrantly  prejndges</span><span>  the  issue.  The  question  of  doubl«1</span><span>  dumping  of  wool  goes  far  deeper</span><span>  than  the  handling  on  the  wharves.</span><span>  In  war-time  it  became  imperative</span><span>  m  the  national  interest,  mainly  be-</span><span>  cause  of  lack  of  shipping  tonnage.</span><span>  The  shipping  shortage  continues,</span><span>  I  hence  that  considération  remains.</span><span>  Another  and  more-  important  one</span><span>  !  is  that  the  15  to  20  per  cent  «aving</span><span>  I  in  cost  which  it  means  may  make</span><span>  all  the  difference  to  the  preserva*</span><span>  tion  of  the  wool  industry  in  its</span><span>  fight  against  substitutes.  In  short</span><span>  it  may  become  essential  in  the  in-</span><span>  terests  of  the  national  economy  to</span><span>  continue  to  pack  wool  in  this  man-</span><span>  ner,  whatever  arrangements  have</span><span>  to  be  made  on  the  wharves  to  meet</span><span>  the  situation.  This  must  be  taken</span></p> <p><span>  into  account  by  any  commission</span><span>  appointed  to  go  into  the  question</span><span>  of  double  dumping.  Therefore  it  is</span><span>  mach  too  «non  for  Mr  Healy  to  Ax</span><span>  press  ""confidence""  that  the  practice</span><span>  will  go  by  the  board.</span></p> <p><span>  But  it  ia  the  last  part  of  W*</span><span>  Healy'a  statement  that  is  most  il-</span><span>  luminating,  since  it  reveals  the  real</span><span>  nigger  in  the  woodpile.  ""Not  only</span><span>  will  double  dumping  go,""  he  de-</span><span>  clares,  ""but  it  will  lead  to  a  reduc-</span><span>  tion  in  the  weight  of  a  number  of</span><span>  other  items  of  cargo.""  So  that  is</span><span>  what  lies  behind  it  all.  Men  with</span></p> <p><span>  long  experience  -  of  the  shipping</span></p> <p><span>  trade  felt  that  the  sudden  strike</span></p> <p><span>  against  double  dumping  was  the  j</span><span>  thin  edgo  of  a  very  thick  wedge.</span><span>  They  were1  not  mistaken.  If,  ft</span><span>  marks  the  beginning  of  a  cam-</span><span>  paign  to  reduce  the  weight  of  all</span><span>  shipping  packages  we  are  ht  for  a</span><span>  series  of  wharf  troubles  that  will</span><span>  have  far-reaching  repercussions  on</span><span>  the  whole  community.</span></p> <p><span>  These  are  aspects  which  do  not</span><span>  come  within  the  purview  of  the</span><span>  Commission  that  is  to  inquire  into</span><span>  double  dumping,  but  they  do</span><span>  gravely  concern  all  who  are  in  any</span><span>  way  dependent  on  shipping,</span><span>  amongst  whom  must  be  included</span><span>  the  people  of  Central  Queensland.</span></p> <p><span>  Hence  the  ""settlement  of  the</span><span>  wharf  strike,""  announced  with  so</span><span>  much  unction  by  the  Acting  Prime</span><span>  Minister,  may  be  only  the  begin-</span><span>  ning  of  something  far  more</span><span>  sinister.</span></p> ",Article,1946-05-20,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON.

Time  was</span></p> <p><span>  when  folk  believed  that  the  smoke</span></p> <p><span>  from  Mr  Chitley's  pipe  and  his</span><span>  economy,  ot  words  interposed  be-</span><span>  tween  the  world  and  a  powerful</span><span>  philosophy  and  strong  moral  re-</span><span>  straints.  They  recalled  that  Bald-</span><span>  win  smoked  a  pipe  and  sacked  a</span><span>  King  of  f  England»  and  believed</span><span>  that  a  Chifley  might  at  least</span><span>  discipline,  .a  .  few-  refractory</span><span>  unions.  But  they  know  better</span><span>  now.  'Where'  they  once  believed</span><span>  that  Chifley's  silence  was  both</span><span>  golden  ""and  Btrong,  they  know  now</span><span>  that  it  dows  from  a  leaden,  tomb</span><span>  and  is  the  product  of  inner  hesit-</span><span>  ancy  and  weakness.</span></p> <p><span>  Foremost  among  his  worries  is</span><span>  when  in  this  year  to  hold  the</span><span>  pending  election,  and  why.  The</span></p> <p><span>  Constitution  of  the  Common-</span></p> <p><span>  wealth  insists  upon  the  election</span><span>  being  held  l&is  year,  and  electors</span><span>  will  expectv  to  be  given  some</span><span>  tangible  reason  for  the  Chifley</span><span>  Government  expecting  to.  be  re-</span><span>  turned.  Flowing  from  this  prob-</span><span>  lem  and  of  it,  is  whether  or  not</span><span>  to  produce  the  budget  before</span><span>  poing  to  the  people  BO.  that  ""  they</span><span>  will  know  much  of  the  worst  that</span><span>  it  must  hold,  or.  whether  to  bring</span><span>  on-  the  election  and  promise  to</span><span>  tell  electors  all  about  thé  budget</span><span>  after  the  election  tumult  and</span></p> <p><span>  shouting  have  subsided,  and  his</span></p> <p><span>  Government  is  safe  for  another</span><span>  three  years.  The  measure  of  pub-</span><span>  lic  suspicion'  regarding  bungling</span><span>  and  shockingly  bad  administra-</span><span>  tion  should  influence  Mr  Chifley</span><span>  as,  for  instance,  if  the  badness  of</span><span>  the  budget  does  not  come  up  to</span><span>  public  apprehension,  it  would  be</span><span>  prudent  to  bring  it'  down  and</span><span>  settle  that  point.  If  on  the  other</span></p> <p><span>  band  it  is  in  fact  much  worse</span></p> <p><span>  than  people  suspect,  then  it  .  would</span><span>  be  equivalent  to  political  suicide</span><span>  to  bring  it  down  at  all  this  side</span><span>  of  the  election.  Hence,  one  of  Mr</span><span>  Chifley's  pipe  dreams  will  be  to</span><span>  budget  or  not  to  budget  before  the</span><span>  electaon.  Taxpayers-and  they  are</span></p> <p><span>  legion-are  waiting  anxiously  tel</span><span>  know  whether  the  Chifley  Govern-j</span></p> <p><span>  ment  will  fix  the  next  tax  rate</span><span>  before  going  to  thé  country  or</span><span>  will  promue  to  do  the  generous'</span><span>  .thing  if  returned  with  a  working:</span><span>  ^majority,  and  recipients  of  one'</span><span>  kind  of  pension  or  another  will</span><span>  «vant  to  know  if  taxation  is  to</span><span>  stay  np  or  their  pension  to  come</span><span>  down.

This  signifies  ratification  bj</span><span>  Australia  of  the  Bretton  Woods</span><span>  agreement,  and  its  huge  majority</span><span>  notwithstanding  Mr  Chifley  will</span><span>  require  voting  aid  from  the  Op-</span><span>  position  to  get  that  through  th«</span><span>  House.

In</span><span>  tlie  public  mind  was  a  feeling  that,</span><span>  as  soon  as  the  war  ended,  the</span><span>  clothing  position  would  at  ouce  im-</span><span>  prove,  and  rationing  of  these  goods</span></p> <p><span>  would  be  one  of  the  first  to  be  lift-</span><span>  ed.

Naturally  those  discharged</span><span>  from  the  Services  and  refitting  for</span><span>  civilian  life  have  placed  a  heavy</span></p> <p><span>  strain  on  the  supplies  of  civilian</span><span>  clothing,  but  even  this  does  not-en-</span><span>  tirely  explain  the  existing  and</span><span>  threatened  lack  of  supplies.</span></p> <p><span>  The  eagerness  of  Commonwealth</span><span>  trade  agencies  to  take  advantage</span><span>  of  the  present  .opportunity  to  estab-</span><span>  lish  an  export  trade  for  Austral-</span><span>  ian  fabrics  ia  no  doubt  a  contrib-</span><span>  uting  factor.  Without  questioning</span><span>  the  wisdom  of  taking  proper  meas-</span><span>  ures  to  ensure  future  -trade  avenues</span><span>  this  aspect  can  be  carried  too  far»</span><span>  and  the  point  has  been  raised  that</span><span>  the  best  products  of  the  Austral-</span><span>  ian  clothing  mills  are  being  sent</span><span>  outside  to  customers  who,  eager  to</span><span>  secure  them  in  the  face  of  the  pres-</span><span>  ent  world  shortage,  may  not  be  so</span><span>  ready  to  buy  when  other  supplies</span><span>  ere  available.  Be  that  as  it  may</span><span>  the  starvation  of  the  home</span><span>  market  can  be  carried  too  far,  m</span><span>  this  as  in  other  matters.</span></p> <p><span>  If  it  could  be  sifted  to  the  bot-</span><span>  tom,  the  greatest  cause  of  the</span><span>  clothing  famine  would  probably  be</span><span>  I  found  to  lie  at  the  door  of  that</span></p> <p><span>  which  is  the  root  of  most  of  Aus-</span></p> <p><span>  tralia's  troubles  today-lower  pro-</span><span>  duction.  Whatever  reasons  exist  for</span><span>  cotton  and  rayon  goods  being  down,</span><span>  and  this  can  be  accounted  for  be-</span><span>  cause  of  our  reliance  on  outside</span><span>  countries,  the  falling  off  in  wool</span><span>  j  lens  is  harder  to  explain.  -  c</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  not  because  the  mills  ""  have</span><span>  not  the  raw  material,  since  we  pro-</span><span>  duce  that  in  abundance,  and  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  present  moment  buyers  from  the</span><span>  j  ends  of  the.  earth  are  in  Australia</span></p> <p><span>  literally  fighting  to  acquire  our</span><span>  wool.  The  labour  difficulty  is  not</span><span>  the  complete  answer  either.  By  pro-</span><span>  cess  of  elimination  we  get  down  to</span><span>  the  point  so  often  raised,  that</span><span>  Australia's  lack  of  production  of</span><span>  the  things  which  she  should  be</span><span>  able  to  produce  in  abundance  is  due</span><span>  to  lack,  of  incentive,  and  the  lack</span><span>  of  incentive  resides  in  the  existing</span><span>  taxation  system  and  uncertainty</span><span>  concerning  the  industrial  future.</span><span>  Secure  peace  in  industry  and  adjOBt</span><span>  taxation  rates  so  that  management</span><span>  and  operatives  are  given  induce-</span><span>  ment  for  maximum  output,  and</span><span>  clothing  as  well  as  many  other</span><span>  shortages  will  steadily  be  made  up.</span></p> <p><span>  To  the  many  causes  of  the  cloth-</span><span>  ing  difficulties  must  be  aSQed  that</span><span>  of  the  black  marketer.

The  New  South  Wales  ex-</span><span>  perience  shows  that  it  is  que  thing</span><span>  to'  talk  about  the  justhess  of</span><span>  claims  and  of  great  potentialities</span><span>  and  quite  another  to  adopt  practi-</span><span>  cal  .  steps  to  secure  a  share  *in  a</span><span>  country's  industrial  activities.</span></p> <p><span>  None  will  challenge  Roekhamp</span><span>  ton's  claims  or  deny  that  we  have</span><span>  the  potentials  for  considerable  in-</span><span>  dustrial  growth,  but  there  are  cer-</span><span>  tain  prerequisites  which  have  to  be</span><span>  1  taken  into  account.  Foremost</span></p> <p><span>  amongst  them  are  cheap  power  and</span><span>  ;  water.  Young,  Cootamundra  and</span></p> <p><span>  ;  other  country  centres  in  New</span><span>  South;  Wales  supply  electric  power</span><span>  at  0.0d  per  unit  and  water  at  a</span><span>  correspondingly  low  rate.  Cheap</span><span>  power  has  been  made  possible  by</span><span>  linking  up  the  big  generating</span><span>  plants  on  the  grid  system,  with</span><span>  the  result  that  country  town«  en</span><span>  i  joy  virtually  the  same  rate  as</span><span>  Sydney.  Happily  we  are  well  on</span><span>  the  way  to  solving  our  own  power</span><span>  problem  by  the  regional  electrific-</span><span>  ation  scheme  now  in  course  of  es</span><span>  tablishnjent,  but  something  will</span><span>  ,  have  to  be  done  about  water,  see</span><span>  &lt;  ing  that  the  ordinary  commercial</span><span>  '  charge  here.-is  2/6  per  1000  gallons.</span></p> <p><span>  >Power,  and  water  are  not  the</span></p> <p><span>  '.only  'essentials  to  an  industrial</span><span>  .undertaking.  Labour  is  quite  as</span><span>  '  important,  and  ijt  is  most  interest-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  to  learn  in  relation  to  this  that</span></p> <p><span>  there  has  been  a.  complete  reversal  j</span><span>  of  a  long-established  condition.  At</span><span>  one  time  the  chief  re»son  why</span><span>  factories'  we're  established  in  ur-</span><span>  ban  areas  was  because  of  th*</span></p> <p><span>  plentiful  supply  of  labour.  The</span><span>  ,  placement  of  the  factory  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  city  in  tum1  served  as  a  magnet</span><span>  to'  draw  country  dwellers  thereto,</span><span>  on  the  principle  that  one  had  to  go</span><span>  where  the  work  was  .This  wan  a</span><span>  major  factor,  among  others,  that</span><span>  started  the  ""drift  to  the  city""  that</span><span>  assumed  -  alarming  proportion»</span><span>  practically  up  to  the  outbreak  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  second  World  ""War.</span></p> <p><span>  '  Now  the  pendulum  has  swung</span></p> <p><span>  the  other""  way.  There  is  no  sur-</span><span>  plus  of  labour  in  the  cities  and  it</span><span>  cannot  be  augmented  from  the</span><span>  country,  because  of  lack  of  housing</span><span>  accommodation.  On  the  other  hand,</span><span>  'there  is  a  limited  reserve  pool,  es</span><span>  .Specially  of  female  labour,  in  th«*</span></p> <p><span>  country  towns.

Ow-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  to  betier  living  .  cónditíon^</span><span>  good  wages  and  ""work  conditions,</span><span>  and  better  relations  between  lem</span><span>  ployer  and  ""  employées,  then»  ig</span><span>  very  little  absenteeism,  few  strike»</span><span>  a""nd,  what  is  most  important,  tho</span><span>  production  per-  unit  is  as  much  as</span><span>  33.3  higher  than  in.  the  cities</span><span>  Little  wonder  that  the  manufac-</span><span>  turer  is  showing  an  -appreciation</span><span>  of  the  country  centre  as  the  place</span><span>  to  establish  his  works,  and  this</span><span>  accounts  for  the  willingness  to</span><span>  take  over  idle  war  factories..  The</span><span>  favourable  freight  rates  offered  in</span><span>  New-  South  Wales  to  enable  Coun-</span><span>  try  manufacturers  to  compete  on</span><span>  the  Sydney  market  Berves  as  a  fur</span><span>  ther  encouragement.</span></p> <p><span>  .  Tîie  radical  change  -that  has</span><span>  come  ,about  in  New  South  Wales</span><span>  required  at  first  sympathetic  Gov-</span><span>  ernment  action.  According  to  Mr</span><span>  Cahill,  this  was  secured  ""following</span><span>  the  return  of  &  number  of  young</span><span>  country  members,  who  banded  to-</span><span>  gether  to  demand  that  something</span><span>  be  done  to  stop  the  exodus  ,  of</span><span>  population  that  was  *  making</span><span>  ""ghost""  towns  of  many  rural</span><span>  centres  in  the  State.  The  first  step</span><span>  was  the  appointment  of  a  special</span><span>  staff,  within  what  is  known  as  the</span><span>  Development  Information  Bureau.</span><span>  It  became  the-  function  of  thia</span><span>  Btaff  to  investigate  possibilities  in</span><span>  particular  districts,  tien  endeavour</span></p> <p><span>  to  interest  the  manufacturer,  and</span><span>  ,  see  that  he  was  given  assistance</span></p> <p><span>  in  securing  factory  sites,  power</span><span>  and  water  and  favourable  freight</span><span>  concessions.  Queensland's  Bureau</span><span>  of  Industry  might  profitably  es-</span><span>  tablish  a  branch  to  function  along</span><span>  the  -  same  linea/</span></p> <p><span>  Mr  Cahill,  when  in  Brisbane,</span><span>  was  surprised  to  note  that  most</span><span>  of  the  goods  sold  over  the  counter</span></p> <p><span>  j  came  from'  New  South  Wales  or</span><span>  {Victoria.

He  considers</span><span>  that  Queensland  -provincial  centres</span><span>  have  one  great-  advantage  over</span><span>  New  South  Wales  in  our  well  de-</span><span>  veloped  ports.</span></p> <p><span>  The  information  conveyed  by  the</span><span>  New  South  Wales  legislator  and</span><span>  champion,  of  decentralisation  of  in-</span><span>  dustry  should  serve  as  an  encour-</span></p> <p><span>  agement  to  local  interests  which</span></p> <p><span>  are  addressing  themselves  to  this</span><span>  aspect  of  diBtrict  development.  Be</span><span>  Bides  telling  them  what  has  been</span><span>  achieved  in  his  own  State  he  show«</span><span>  how  it  was  done.  The  first  step</span><span>  will  be  to  se'.ect  a  starting  point.</span><span>  It  mi""ht  suggest  itself  to  manv</span><span>  that  the  obvious  starting  point  is</span><span>  .to  send  to  ""our  own  Parliament  a</span></p> <p><span>  'group  of  country  members  who</span><span>  j  will  demand  that  action  be  taken</span><span>  j  to  revitalise  our  own  towns  and</span><span>  I  make  them  thriving  industrial</span></p> <p><span>  centres.  That  sounds  Utopian  in</span><span>  the  light  of  present-day  develop</span><span>  m°nt  in  the  industrial  sphere.  But</span><span>  all  will  hope  this  development  is</span><span>  a  phase  that  will  pas»  one  day.</span><span>  I  Perhaps  there  is  nothing  that  will</span><span>  .  more  assist  its  passing  than  this</span></p> <p><span>  very  decentralisation  of  industry.</span></p> ",Article,1946-05-22,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON.

But  the  message  serves  to</span><span>  remind  us  that  Russia  f.as  two</span><span>  fronts,  and  she  is  no  less  active  on</span><span>  that  in  the  east  than  in  that  in</span><span>  the  west.  We  hear  more  of  Molo-</span><span>  tov  than  we  do  of  Mao  Tse-tung</span><span>  because  the  former  is  a  diplomatic</span><span>  obstructionist  at  the  Peace  Confer-</span><span>  ence,  and  the  latter  is  only  a  pro-</span><span>  fessional  war  leader.

In  any  case,  we</span><span>  may  expect  ere  long  to  hear  more</span><span>  ¡of  names  like  Mongolia  (Inner  and</span><span>  Outer),  Sinkiang  (dr  Chinese  Tur</span><span>  kistan),  and  Tanna-Tuva.  Although</span><span>  the  main  Russo-Japanese  conflict</span><span>  always  seemed  to  be  centred  far-</span><span>  ther  to  the  east  in  Manchuria  and</span><span>  «.astern  Siberia,  the  real  Russian</span><span>  tender  6pot  was  in  Mongolia  that,</span><span>  in  Japanese  hands,  carried  the</span><span>  threat  of  cutting  Siberia  in  two.</span><span>  Although  thinly  populated  and</span><span>  under-developed,  Mongolia  and</span><span>  Sinkiang  have  an  excellent  net-</span><span>  work  of  ""highways  not  the  least</span><span>  important  of  which  is  the  old  Silk</span><span>  Road  that,  from  the  Middle  Ages,</span><span>  has  connected  China  with  Iran  and</span><span>  played  an  important  role  in  the</span><span>  trade  of  several  '  civilisations.</span></p> <p><span>  Following  so  closely  upon  the</span><span>  defeat  by  Japan  of  Russia,  the</span><span>  Chinese  revolution  in  1912  gave</span><span>  Russia  her  opportunity  to  carry</span><span>  her  influence  into  Outer  Mongolia</span><span>  and  thc  little-known  Tanna-Tuva,</span><span>  which  lies  south  of  the  Nimouss</span><span>  insk  region  in  Siberia.  Tanna-Tuva</span><span>  is  larger  than  Queensland  with  a</span><span>  population  of  less  than  one-third</span><span>  that  of  Brisbane;  but  it  is  rich  in</span><span>  asbestos,  copper,  gobi,  iron  and</span></p> <p><span>  oil.  Russian  ""colonisation""  was</span></p> <p><span>  fostered  by  some  bloody  repres-</span><span>  sions,  and  it  moved  from  the  ""pro-</span><span>  tection''  of  Russia  to  the  full</span><span>  status  of  an  independent  republic</span><span>  that  ha8  no  diplomatic,  economic,</span><span>  financial  or  military  relations  with</span><span>  any  country  but  Russia.

Anyway,  Sinki-</span><span>  ang  is  neavily  Sovietised,  and  her</span><span>  commercial  relations  that  were</span><span>  once  exclusively  with  China  are</span><span>  now  exclusively  with  Russia.</span></p> <p><span>  The  so-called  ""republic""  of  Mon-</span><span>  golia,  the  .people  of  which  are  by</span><span>  tradition,  manner  and  religion  es-</span><span>  sentially  Chinese,  is  also  com-</span><span>  pletely  Sovietised.  The  procediere</span><span>  here  followed  the  standard  pat*</span><span>  tern:  formation  of  a  Popular  Re'</span><span>  volutionary  Party,  with  leader«</span><span>  trained  in  Moscow  schools;  forma</span></p> <p><span>  tion  of  a  congress  said  to  represent</span><span>  tba  people,  proclamation  of  a  re«</span><span>  public  with  a  semi-Soviet  constitu-</span><span>  tion.  Then  followed  a  short  period</span><span>  of  internal  conflict  until  they  were</span><span>  ""repressed""  in  the  usually  efficient</span><span>  Communist  manner  of  ""fixing""  a</span><span>  democracy.  Then  during  the  3-year</span><span>  period!  to  1038  the  Mongolian</span><span>  Popular  Revolutionary  Party  was</span><span>  accused  of  collaborating  with  the</span><span>  ""feudal  lords,  the  Lamas  and</span><span>  Japanese  agents""  and  its  members</span><span>  were  quietly  but  efficiently  exter-</span><span>  minated.  After  that  the  structure</span><span>  ot  the  Republic  of  (Outer)  Mon-</span><span>  golia  was  ""stabilised""  with  a  one</span><span>  party  dictatorship  affiliated  with</span><span>  the  Comintern,  with  State  owner-</span><span>  ship  and  operation  of  commerce</span><span>  if  ter  the  Russian  pattern;  econ-</span><span>  omic  agreement  with  Soviet  Rus-</span></p> <p><span>  sia  and  none  other  and  a  com-</span></p> <p><span>  pletely  Russian  form  of  police  ad-</span><span>  ministration.  Like  Sinkiang,  with</span><span>  the  exception  that  the  republic</span><span>  was  allowed  no  economic,  financial</span><span>  and  social  intercourse  with  any</span><span>  other  country,  and  that  it  was</span><span>  fitted  with  a  one-party  democracy,</span><span>  Outer  Mongolia  was  and  ii'a  free</span></p> <p><span>  country.</span></p> <p><span>  The  position  in  Inner  Mongolia'</span><span>  with  its  upwards  of  e'ighf  million</span></p> <p><span>  inhabitants  who  nave  in  the  main</span><span>  remained  Chinese,  is  that  lt  is  to</span><span>  that  extent  less  subject  to  Soviet</span><span>  dominance.

"<p><span>  W  jitarning  bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  .  ROCKHAMPTON,</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  JULY  27,  1046</span></p> <p><span>  MASCULINITY.</span></p> <p><span>  '.Masculinity''  says  the  statis-</span><span>  tician  ""is  the  number  of  males  per</span><span>  every  IOU  females  in  the  total</span><span>  population,""  haring  said  which  he</span><span>  sets  out  the  quantities  in  trim</span></p> <p><span>  rows  and  austere  columns  and</span></p> <p><span>  passes  on  to  the  next  job.  That</span><span>  there  is  more  to  it  than  this  is</span><span>  obvious  from  the  fleed  for  the</span><span>  statistician  to  tabulate  his  re-</span></p> <p><span>  sults.  Did  infants  appear  uni-</span><span>  formly  as  in  the  &ong  ""A  boy  for</span><span>  you,  a  girl  '  for  me""  there  would</span></p> <p><span>  be  little  need  for  the  statistician</span><span>  and  less'  for  his  tabulations.  But</span><span>  they  do  nothing  of  the  kind,  and</span><span>  scientists  are  shy  about  advanc-</span><span>  ing  reasons  for  this  contumacy,</span><span>  and  other  than  in  general  terms</span><span>  they  offer  no  reason  for  Aus-</span><span>  tralia,  Canada,  Eire  and  New  Zea-</span><span>  land  being  well  down  the  mascu-</span><span>  linity  list  of  the  live  births  of  21</span><span>  countries,  and  at  the  top  of  the</span><span>  list  of  the  same  countries  for</span><span>  masculinity  of  the  living  popula-</span><span>  tion.  Is  it  safer  for  male  children</span><span>  to  live  in  those  countries?  Nor</span><span>  do  they  tell  ust  why  Spain,  which</span></p> <p><span>  starts  off  with  105  male  and  95</span></p> <p><span>  !  female  children  in  every  200</span><span>  births,  finishes  up  with  a  living</span><span>  population  of  -103  females  and  97</span><span>  males  in  every  200  of  living  pop-</span><span>  ulation.  The  lay  mind  may  sug-</span></p> <p><span>  gest  bull-fights,  which  discounts  j</span></p> <p><span>  two  world  wars  in  both  of  which  !</span><span>  Spain  was  ^aggressively  neutral.</span></p> <p><span>  The  scientist  tells  us  that  a</span><span>  higher  male-child  mortality  es-</span><span>  tablishes  ""numerical  equilibrium</span><span>  between  the  two  in  early  youth,""</span><span>  but  that  can  apply  only  where</span><span>  masculinity  at  birth  is  high,  and</span><span>  would  in  time  decimate  the  male</span><span>  population  iii  western  European</span><span>  countries  where  it  is  consistently</span><span>  low.  The  male  is  also  more  liable</span><span>  to  ""industrial  accidents,  war  and</span><span>  other  causes  of  special  mortality,""</span><span>  while  Professor  Haldane  states</span><span>  that  deaths-from  childbirth  and</span><span>  its  complications  ""about  equals</span><span>  the  excess  of  male  over  female</span><span>  suicides.""  Then  nearing  the  end  of</span><span>  life  feminine  vitality  rises  super-</span><span>  ior  to  that  of  the  male,  and  so</span><span>  ""they  continue  to  form  the  major-</span><span>  ity  of  the  community.""  Thia</span><span>  throws  new  light  upon  the  popu-</span><span>  lar  conception  of  ""the  weaker</span><span>  sex,""  though  it  is  expressive</span></p> <p><span>  rather  of  the  relative  life  hazards</span></p> <p><span>  that  confront  them  than  explan-</span><span>  atory  of  the  astonishing  fact  that</span><span>  throughout  the  civilised  world</span></p> <p><span>  more  male  than  female  children</span></p> <p><span>  are  born.  Over  a  period  ranging</span><span>  from  seven  to  ten  years  to  1925</span><span>  the  disparity  varied  from  47  more</span><span>  males  than  females  per  1000</span><span>  births  in  the  case  of  Spain  to  23</span><span>  more  in  the  case  of  Chile.  Nearer</span><span>  home,'  between  the  Australian</span><span>  census  years  1Ö21  and  1933,  .  of</span><span>  every  200  births  105  were  mal«</span></p> <p><span>  and  95  female.</span></p> <p><span>  So  we  have  Mother  Nature  pro-</span><span>  ducing  5  per  cent  more  male  than</span></p> <p><span>  female  .  children  in  Australia,</span><span>  which  numerical  superiority  is</span><span>  whittled  away  by  heavier  strains</span><span>  and  stresses  so  that  the  mascul-</span><span>  inity  of  the  population  is  well  be-</span><span>  low  that  of  the  babies  born.  What</span><span>  is  more,  it  has  declined  steadily</span><span>  over  the  past  20  years,  and</span></p> <p><span>  whether  that  is  due  to  life  becom-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  progressively  harder  for  men</span><span>  than  for  women  is  not  revealed  by</span><span>  the  statistician.  Left  at  this  stage,</span></p> <p><span>  the  matter  would  be  of  academic</span></p> <p><span>  interest  only;  but  a  little  analy-</span><span>  sis  of  Australian  masculinity  re-</span><span>  veals  that,  beneath  the  surface,</span><span>  this  factor  is  a  most  important</span><span>  one  in  the  economic  and  social</span><span>  life  of  the  country.  There  is  for</span><span>  instance  a  different  masculinity</span><span>  of  the  population  in  different</span><span>  States,  the  two  highest  being</span><span>  Queensland  and  Western  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  on  opposite  sides  of  the</span><span>  continent,  the  former  of  which  in</span><span>  .  creased'its  disparity  of  men  over</span></p> <p><span>  women  between  1921  and  1942,</span><span>  while  the  latter  decreased  hers.</span><span>  Victoria  has  always-since  1921</span><span>  had  more  women  than  men,</span><span>  though  Tasmania  changed  from</span><span>  1  that  condition  in  '1921  to  having</span></p> <p><span>  more  men  than  women  m  >  1942,</span><span>  while  South  Australia  did  just</span><span>  the  opposite.  That  of  course  is  for</span><span>  whole  States,  and  the  tendency</span><span>  over  all  Australia  was  for  the  5</span><span>  per  cent  greater  number  of  boy</span><span>  ?  babies  to  be  used  up  in  the  battle</span></p> <p><span>  of  life  as  they  grew,  and  for  the</span><span>  total  population  at  the  end  of  21</span><span>  years  at  1942  to.  have  only  '1  per</span><span>  cent  excess  masculinity.  -</span></p> <p><span>  But  it  is  vastly  different  within</span><span>  States,  where  the  strong  tendency</span><span>  in  women  in  1921  to  cling  to  the</span><span>  cities  and  towns  was  emphasised</span><span>  in  1933.  For  every  1000  females</span><span>  in  all  Australia's  cities  in  1921</span><span>  the»  wars  only  674  mal««,  mad</span></p> <p><span>  that  bad  dropped  in  1933  to  only</span></p> <p><span>  941  males.  In  the  cities  of  Vic-</span><span>  toria  and  Tasmania  there  were</span><span>  more  men  than  women  in  1921,</span><span>  but  by  1933  the  women  had  flock-</span><span>  ed  in  from  the  outback  and  out-</span><span>  numbered  the  men  by  more  than</span></p> <p><span>  [10  per  cent.  Prom  the  top  of  the</span><span>  masculinity  list  for  cities  and</span><span>  towns,  both  these  States  fell  to</span><span>  the  bottom.  On  the  other  hand,</span><span>  the  birth  rate  within  the  munici-</span><span>  palities  is  lower  than  in  the  coun-</span><span>  try,  which  is  accounted  for  in</span><span>  part  by  disparity  of  the  sexes,  but</span><span>  mainly  because  many  of  such</span></p> <p><span>  women  would  be  ""bachelors""  re-</span><span>  tired  from  business  or  the  ser-</span></p> <p><span>  vices.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  striking  difference  in</span><span>  masculinity  is  between  munici-</span><span>  palities  and  the  country  where,</span><span>  all  over  Australia  in  1933,  there</span><span>  was  just  on  25  per  cent  more  men</span><span>  than  women,  and  that  disparity</span></p> <p><span>  had  doubled  since  1921.  The  two</span><span>  worst  States  are  Queensland  and</span><span>  Western  Australia,  the  former  of</span><span>  which  has  133  men  and  67  women</span><span>  in  every  200  of  the  population  :</span></p> <p><span>  while  the  latter  has  148  men  and</span></p> <p><span>  51  women  in  every  200  of  the  pop-</span><span>  ulation.  The  two  best  States  are</span><span>  South  Australia  and  Victoria,</span><span>  both  of  which  contain  more</span></p> <p><span>  women  than  men,  and  for  every</span><span>  200  of  total  country  population</span></p> <p><span>  the  former  has  119  men  and  81</span><span>  women  and  the  latter  has  120  men</span><span>  and  80  women.</span></p> <p><span>  The  net  result  of  it  all  is  that</span></p> <p><span>  .13  years  ago  Australia  had  a  very</span></p> <p><span>  lopsided  population  relatively  to</span><span>  the  6exes  in  the  municipalities</span><span>  and  country  respectively,  and  it</span><span>  is-  probably  much  worse  now.  Its</span><span>  economic  implications-are  of  course</span><span>  considerable,  and  nobody  seems  to</span><span>  have  speculated  upon  how  this</span><span>  condition  of  affairs  has  helped  the</span><span>  falling  birth-rate.

Whereas  Kipling  describe</span><span>  heraldry  as  the  shorthand  of  his</span><span>  tory,  insignia  is  now  a  short  cu</span><span>  to  knowing  the  rank,  office  or  ser</span><span>  vice  of  men  in  an  organised  bod;</span><span>  like  an  army.

Every  avenue  of  enquiry  lee</span><span>  to  a  dead  end  and  the  attempt</span><span>  was  abandoned.  Had  it  been  ex-</span><span>  tended  to  the  Herald's  College.</span><span>  London,  some  light  may  have  been</span><span>  thrown  upon  the  origin  and  sig-</span><span>  nificance  of  our  official  seal.  On</span><span>  the  other  hand,  that  august  fra-</span><span>  ternity  may  know  no  more  of  the</span><span>  matter  than  we  do,  and  unless  it</span><span>  was  registered  at  some  time  or</span><span>  other  that  fraternity  would  cer-</span><span>  tainly  know  nothing  about  it.  In</span><span>  that  case,  Rockhampton  would  be</span><span>  committing  no  greater  sin  against</span><span>  the  lawB  of  heraldry  than  is  the</span><span>  city  of  Brisbane,  which  also  dis-</span><span>  ports  itself  under  an  unofficial  or</span><span>  non-registered  coat  of  arms.  The</span><span>  only  official  grant  of  arms  in</span><span>  Queensland  outside  of  Government</span><span>  House  is  that  for  the  whole  State.</span></p> <p><span>  New  South  Wales  has  a  grant</span><span>  of  arms  as  also  has  Sydney,  addi-</span><span>  tional  to.  which  the  latter  has  been</span><span>  granted  an  official  badge.  Few</span><span>  cities  even  in  Britain  are  so  liber-</span><span>  ally  endowed.  Victoria  is  in  the</span><span>  same  position  as  Queensland,  in</span><span>  that  the  State.  has  its  grant  of</span><span>  arms,  while  Melbourne  has  an  un-</span><span>  registered  coat.  Conversely,  Ade-</span><span>  laide  has  «  grant  of  arms  but  the</span><span>  State  of  South  Australia  has  none,</span><span>  but  uses  instead  its  ""Governor's</span><span>  badge,""  and  Western  Australia  ls</span><span>  in  the  same  state  of  heraldic  be-</span><span>  nightedness  as  is  South  Australia.</span><span>  Then  Tasmania  has  its  official</span><span>  grant  of  arms  for  the  State,  bat</span><span>  Hobart  has  only  an  unregistered</span><span>  coal  If  the  six  States  are  to  re-</span><span>  deem  their  heraldic  legitimacy</span><span>  new  State  coats  of  arms  are  needed</span><span>  for  South  Australia  and  Western</span><span>  Australia,  and  also  for  the  three</span><span>  capitals  Brisbane,  Hobart  and  Mel</span><span>  bourne.  Neither  of  the  two  terri-</span><span>  tories  has  risen  to  the  dignity  of</span><span>  official  cognisance  of  the  Herald's</span><span>  College,  though  Canberra  has  its</span><span>  ¿rant  of  arms  and  also  its  great</span></p> <p><span>  seal.</span></p> <p><span>  It  would  appear  that  this</span><span>  might  have  exhausted  our  heraldic</span><span>  botch  potch,  but  there  is  more  to</span><span>  come.  The  coat  of  arms  of  the</span><span>  Commonwealth  is  made  up  of  the</span><span>  Governor's  badge  of  all  six  States,</span><span>  and  there  is  no  provision  for  ex</span></p> <p><span>  pansion  if  or  when  either  the</span><span>  Federal  or  Northern  Territory-or</span><span>  both-claim  the  right  to  be  repre-</span></p> <p><span>  sented  thereon.  In  an  heraldic  sense</span></p> <p><span>  they  are  simply  not  in  the  Com-</span><span>  monwealth.  Then  the  first  Com-</span><span>  monwealth  Coat  of  Anns  incurred</span><span>  mistrust  because,  it  would  seem,</span><span>  the  emu  and  the  kangaroo  were</span><span>  depicted  as  un-Australian,  the  lat-</span><span>  ter  having  the  elongated  body  of</span></p> <p><span>  a  cat  and  the  former  resembled  a</span><span>  pea-hen  on  stilts.  So  a  new  one</span><span>  was  designed,  granted,  and  adopted,</span></p> <p><span>  but  the  old  one  remained  in  use</span><span>  at  the  mint.  That  ia  to-say,  until</span><span>  quite  recently  all  our  silver  coin-</span><span>  age  bore  a  coat  of  arms  that  be-</span><span>  came  obsolete  when  the  new  one</span><span>  was  adopted.</span></p> <p><span>  Even  this  is  not  all,  for  when</span><span>  it  came  to  using  the  new  arms  for</span><span>  the  coinage,  the  artist  introduced</span><span>  sprigs  of  wattle  and  the  word</span><span>  ""  Australia,'*  neither  of  which  were</span></p> <p><span>  mentioned  in  the  verbal  blazon  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  arms.

It  is  largely  an  experi</span><span>  ment,  prompted  by  the  fact  tba</span><span>  in  the  past  many  country  visitor</span><span>  have  gone  off  home  nt  the  conclus</span><span>  ion  of  the  TWC  meeting  in  th</span><span>  middle  of  thc  week,  in  many  cuae</span><span>  without  one  visit  to  the  show.

Ride</span><span>  Show  Street  is  returning  to  the</span><span>  piping  times.  In  short  the  show  is</span><span>  on  its  way  back  and  with  a  return</span><span>  to  normal  times  we  may  see  new</span><span>  records  established.</span></p> <p><span>  There  «re  two  things  about  this</span><span>  show  that  are  valuable  in  their</span><span>  bearing  on  the  future  of  the  dis-</span><span>  trict,  with  particular  reference  to</span><span>  ni  ral  industry.  On*  is  the  display</span><span>  of  a  rrri  cultural,  produce.  Visitors</span><span>  are  almost  dubious  of  some  of</span><span>  these  exhibits  having  been  grown</span><span>  here  in  view  of  prevailing  weather</span><span>  conditions,  ,  and,  conceding  the</span><span>  point,  marré!  how  it  was  done.</span><span>  The  answer  is  simple:  Irrigation.</span><span>  Hence  the  exhibits  tay  emphasis</span><span>  that  we  have  the  soil  but  lack  the</span><span>  rainfall.  Bring  water  to  the  soil</span><span>  and  you  achieve  the  results  which</span><span>  are  on  view  in  the  agricultural</span><span>  section  at  the  show.  This  is  of</span><span>  great  importance  in  view  of  Wie</span><span>  stimulus  to  rural  industry  which</span><span>  should  follow  the  announcement</span><span>  recently  made  of  the  intention  of</span><span>  the  Lakes  Creek  comnauy  to  cm</span><span>  bark  on  new  industries  for  the</span><span>  handling  of  farm  prodicts.  Tlie</span><span>  farms  from  which  the  agricultural</span><span>  exhibits  at  the  show  are  derived</span><span>  should  serve  as  a  model  for  the</span><span>  future  development  of  rural  indus-</span><span>  try  in  our  district.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  noteworthy  feature  is</span><span>  the  confidence  in  the  future  of</span><span>  their  industry  expressed  by  cattle-</span><span>  men  at  the  show.  The  prosperity</span><span>  of  Central  Queensland  depends</span><span>  upon  beef  cattle  more  than  upon</span><span>  anything  else.  At  this  time,  with</span><span>  drought  ravishing  their  pastures,  a</span><span>  long-drawn-out  meat  strike  pre-</span><span>  venting  realisation  on  their  mar-</span><span>  ketable  stock,  and  a  high  incidence</span><span>  of  taxation  discouraging  expansion</span><span>  of  herds  and  holdings,  it  was  re</span><span>  markaHc  to  note  a  buoyant  smrit</span><span>  of  confidence  in  the  future  instead</span><span>  of  despondency.  ""It  will  rain  some</span><span>  time,""  said  the  cattlemen,  ""the</span><span>  present  industrial  oatîawry  must</span><span>  surely  be  a  passing  phase,  taxa-</span><span>  tion  must  be  adjusted  to  encour-</span><span>  age  rather  than  stifle  erte-prise.""</span><span>  Tn  the  meantime,  the  cattle  indus-</span><span>  try  can  carry  on  and  when  there</span><span>  is  a  return  to  normal  conditions</span><span>  a  lon-»  neriod  of  prosperity  should</span></p> <p><span>  lie  ahead.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  most  encouraging  to  en-</span><span>  counter  such  a  spirit  in  these  days</span><span>  of  uncertainty,  doubt  and  some-</span><span>  times  despair.

Monuments  and  tablets</span><span>  of  ancient  empires  depict  victory</span><span>  parades,  and  there  are  frequent</span><span>  references  to  similar  events  I</span><span>  throughout  recorded  history.  In</span><span>  the  days  of  the  Roman  Republic</span><span>  they  were  designed  mainly  with</span><span>  the  object  of  impressing  on  the</span><span>  populace  the  might  and  majesty  of</span><span>  the  monarch,  rather  than  as  hom-</span><span>  age  to  the  fighting  men,  as  is  the</span><span>  «ase  today.</span></p> <p><span>  In  today's  processions,  wherever</span><span>  held,  there  will  be  absent  one  of</span><span>  the  chief  features  of  the  ancient</span><span>  victory  marches  in  that  they  will</span><span>  inclade  neither  man  nor  beast  in-</span><span>  tended  for  sacrificial  offering,  as</span><span>  in  the  days  when  the  Romans</span><span>  drove  the  white  oxen  and  unhappy</span><span>  captives  in  the  parade  of  triumph.</span><span>  Prisoners  of  war  designed  either</span><span>  tor  sacrifice  or  slavery  were</span><span>  dragged  through  the  streets  be*</span><span>  hind  the  coaches  of  the  conquered</span><span>  rulers'  family,  and  piles  of  booty</span><span>  were  drawn  in  the  procession,  the</span><span>  richest  loot  being  showily  dis-</span><span>  played.

Even  the  more  distant  traveller</span><span>  may  not  be  so  insistent  in  de-</span><span>  manding  a  luxury  hotel-  What</span><span>  mainly  do  world  tourists  seek?</span><span>  For  the  most  part  they  are</span><span>  curious  as  to  how  others  live  and</span></p> <p><span>  of  local  events  and  peculiarities.</span><span>  In  short  they  enjoy  ""doing  as</span><span>  Home,  does.""  Having  come  here,</span><span>  the  Barrier  Reef  is  not  the  only</span><span>  thing  visitors  from  Britain  ana</span><span>  America  would  care  to  see.

The  tasa  was  a  col-</span><span>  ossal  one,  yet  the  black  cloud  of</span><span>  human  degradation,  through  want</span><span>  and  misery,  is  being  rolled  back.</span><span>  War  criminals  have  been  brought</span><span>  to  justice,  and  for  the  first  time</span><span>  in  human  history  the  rule  of  inter-</span><span>  national  law  is  taking  the  place  of</span><span>  international  anarchy.  Internat-</span><span>  ional  law  in  itself  can  bring  about</span><span>  tittle}  but  with  powerful  nations</span><span>  grouped  round  it,  as  a  focal  point,</span><span>  to  prevent  any  brigand  who  hap-</span><span>  pens  to  come  by  an  army  from</span><span>  upsetting  the  ""concert  of  nations,""</span><span>  it  can  become  a  very  powerful  war</span><span>  deterrent.  Making  au  entry  into</span><span>  war  through  thc  small  nations  will</span><span>  no  longer  be  possible  BO  long  as</span><span>  men  are  agreed  upon  the  simple</span></p> <p><span>  fundamentals  of  international  law</span></p> <p><span>  by  which  war  criminals  have  just</span><span>  been  tried.</span></p> <p><span>  The  road  is  of  course  far  from</span><span>  easy,  nor  is  the  way  of  internat-</span><span>  ional  councillors  free  from  bumps</span><span>  and  surprises.  Nor  is  it  likely</span><span>  that  the  1  way  will  be  much</span><span>  smoother  until  agreement  is</span><span>  reached  on  one  or  two  troublesome</span><span>  -frontiers,  or  until  odds  and  ends</span><span>  of  people  are  got  together  under</span><span>  an  acceptable  form  of  stable  gov</span></p> <p><span>  eminent.  India  seems  to  be</span></p> <p><span>  nearer  today  to  representative</span><span>  self-government  than  ever  before,</span><span>  as  the  Moslems  find  that  their</span><span>  dream  of  Pakistan  would  leave</span><span>  them  with  two  Moslem  centres  in</span><span>  opposite  sides  of  India,  separated</span><span>  by  many  hundreds  of  miles  and</span><span>  many  millions  ot  Hindus.  '  Maybe</span><span>  that  revelation  will  be  a  stronger</span><span>  faetor  than  any  in  bringing  them</span><span>  to  the  coundl  table.  Not  even</span><span>  Moslem  ingenuity  could  blame  the</span><span>  British  Raj  for  that.  In  Egypt,</span><span>  the  eagerness  of  the  Egyptians  to</span><span>  get  rid  of  the  British  is  complic-</span><span>  ated  by  the  burning  desire  of  the</span><span>  Sudanese  that  tne  British  stay</span></p> <p><span>  until  there  is  reached  some  kind</span></p> <p><span>  of  workable  understanding  be-</span><span>  tween  them  and  the  impetuous</span><span>  Egyptians.  It  will  take  time  for</span><span>  those  conflicting  views  to  be  ironed</span><span>  out,  but  earnest  folk  are  on  the</span><span>  lob.  .</span></p> <p><span>  Trusteeship  in  Palestine  :-  a</span><span>  thankless  job  at  best  ~  is  «till  a</span><span>  risky  business,  but  the  irreconcil-</span><span>  ability  has  been  localised,  and</span><span>  quite  a  lot  of  meddlesome  folk</span><span>  have  been  brought  to  see  that  the</span><span>  problem  is  far  from  being  as  easy</span><span>  «a  it  looks.  .  Britain's  offer  to</span><span>  we-Jthy  Jewish  interests  in  USA</span><span>  that  they  assume  some  responsi-</span><span>  bility  for  their  suggestion,  that</span><span>  Palestine  be  thrown  open  to  the</span><span>  Jews,  had  the  effect  of  silencing</span><span>  much  powerful  propaganda.  Peace</span><span>  in  Palestine  looks  as  far  off  as</span><span>  ever,  but  many  of  the  things  that</span><span>  had  to  be  tried  have  been  tried,  so</span><span>  that  world  sentiment  is  tending  to</span><span>  the  belief  that  if  the  Arabs  and</span><span>  Jews  want  the  mess  cleared  up,</span><span>  they  will  have  to  show  some  of</span><span>  the  elements  of  compromise.</span></p> <p><span>  In  France,  a  '  new  Constitution</span><span>  has  been  passed  by  the  Provisional</span><span>  Government,  and  will  go  to  the</span><span>  people  for  ratification  in  a  week</span><span>  or  two.  Unless  the  de  Gaullist?</span><span>  lead  it  there'  is  unlikely  to  be  much</span><span>  organised  opposition  to  the  meas-</span><span>  ure,  but  in  the  meantime,  French</span><span>  production  is  improving  steadily</span><span>  and  serious  reconstruction  is  tak-</span><span>  ing  shape.  No  one  will  argue  that</span><span>  all  is  peace  and  fraternity  in  the</span><span>  Dutch  East  Indies,  but  there  is</span><span>  less  shooting  there  than  hitherto,</span><span>  there  are  fewer  Allied  prisoners  of</span><span>  war  held  by  Indonesians  in  the</span><span>  interior,  and  the  latest  news  is</span><span>  that  rice  is  being  shipped  from</span><span>  there  to  famine-stricken  India.  As</span><span>  elsewhere,  the  undercurrent  ot</span><span>  thought  is  towards  greater  produc-</span><span>  tion,  and  every  person  of  any</span><span>  nationality  whatsoever  that  feeds</span></p> <p><span>  himself  takes  that  mucîi  off  the</span><span>  broad  shoulders  of  UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span>  The  flare-up  in  American  poli-</span><span>  tics  is  the  outward  expression  of</span><span>  free  American  thought  and  speech.</span><span>  Had  Mr  Wallace  been  in  Russia</span><span>  when  he  assailed  the  foreign  policy</span><span>  of  the  Government  m  which  he</span><span>  was  a  Minister  the  world  would</span></p> <p><span>  have  knowu  nothing  of  the  flare-</span><span>  up,  and  Mr  Wallace  would  not  for</span><span>  long  have  known  much  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  world.  HA  would  have  been  shot</span><span>  out  of  hand  and  buried  for  the</span><span>  good  of  the  Soviet.  As  in  Britain,</span><span>  Mr  Wallace  was  free  to  assail  the</span><span>  principles  of  the  Government,  but</span><span>  fae  must  do  it  from  outside.  A</span><span>  Government  stands  tot  certain</span></p> <p><span>  well-defined  rules  and  principles,  to</span><span>  which  principles  its  Ministers</span></p> <p><span>  must  subscribe.  That  is  one  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  conditions  of  their  appoint-</span><span>  ment,,  but  rebels  against  the  party</span><span>  are  not  uncommon  in  democratic</span><span>  countries,  and  the  party  is  often</span><span>  the  stronger  for  the  rebellion.</span><span>  There  can  be  no  cloying  complac-</span><span>  ency  when  any  member  of  a  party</span><span>  is  liable  to  explode  at  the  council</span><span>  table.  Whether  or  not  the  official</span><span>  USA  attitude  towards  Russia,  at</span><span>  the  councils  of  the  Big  Three  br</span><span>  of  the  Foreign  Ministers,  is  the</span><span>  correct  one  or  cot  is  a  matter  for</span><span>  White  House;  hut  we  may  he  as-</span><span>  sured  that,  as  a  result  of  Mr  Wal-</span><span>  lace's  outburst,  '  it  has  undergone</span><span>  critical  overhaul  behind  the</span></p> <p><span>  scenes.</span></p> <p><span>  v/bile  the  world  was  still  sim-</span></p> <p><span>  mering  over  the  Wallace  denoune</span><span>  ment,  Marshal  Stalin  discounted</span><span>  the  possibility  of  a  nev  war  in</span><span>  the  near  future,  aaid  that  he  had</span><span>  no  doubts  regarding  the  peaceful</span><span>  cooperation  of  Communist  Russia</span><span>  wits  Ihe  outer  world,  and  also</span><span>  that  Communism.  did  not  want  a</span><span>  whole  world  in  which  t*  test  it»</span><span>  theories.  Russia  is  quite  large</span></p> <p><span>  enough  for  that  purpnse.  Since</span><span>  he  spoke  there  has  been  much  re-</span><span>  lief  in  embassies  throughout  the</span><span>  world,  tinctured  with  caution  as</span><span>  to  the  possibility  01  his  having</span><span>  spoken  with  his  tongue  in  his</span><span>  cheek.  We  shall  soon  know,</span><span>  through  his  delegates  to  UNO  and</span><span>  the  measure  of  support  given  by</span><span>  Moscow  to  Fifth  Columnists  in</span><span>  countries  all  over  the  world.  On</span><span>  the  other  hand,  Stalin  and  his  ad-</span><span>  visers  may  have  seen  the  pattern</span><span>  of  world  policy,  set  out  hy  the</span><span>  democracies,  that  is  taking  shape.</span><span>  He  realises  ¿Eat  he  cannot  prevent</span><span>  it  -  even  did  he  so  desire  -  and</span><span>  it  may  be  well  to  be  on  the  aide</span><span>  that  ia  restoring  order  out  of</span><span>  chaos,  especially  as  it  is  the  side</span><span>  that  holds  the  secret  of  the  atomic</span></p> <p><span>  bomb.

"<p><span>  £f)e  ¿ttonring  ^Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  KOCKHAMPTOM,</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  OCTOBER  16,  1946</span></p> <p><span>  STOCK  FIGURES</span></p> <p><span>  Of  far  greater  concern  to  the</span><span>  community  than  may  be  recognised</span><span>  .at  first  blush  are  the  livestock</span><span>  statistics  just  issued  by  the  Com-</span><span>  monwealth  Statistician.  There  is,  of</span><span>  course,  a  general  realisation  that</span><span>  Australia's  cattle,  sheep,  dairy</span><span>  herds  and  pigs  are  in  some  way</span><span>  responsible  for  the  general  pros-</span><span>  perity  of  the  country,  and  that  due</span><span>  largely,  though  not  entirely,  to</span><span>  seasonal  conditions,  they  are  sub-</span><span>  ject  to  fluctuations  in  both  number</span></p> <p><span>  and  market  value.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  doubtful,  however,  if  any-</span></p> <p><span>  one  outside  the  financial  instítu-  ¡</span></p> <p><span>  tiona  directly  interested  in  the</span><span>  stock  industries,  and  certain  Gov-</span><span>  ernment  departments,  have  made</span><span>  even  a  superficial  study  of  the</span><span>  livestock  situation  in  relation  to</span><span>  the  general  economy  of  the  coun-</span><span>  try,  and  its  possible  influence  on</span><span>  future  population  and  employment</span><span>  trends.  Only  last  week  an  interest-</span><span>  ing  sidelight  on  beef  cattle  produc-</span><span>  tion  and  population  was  shown  by</span><span>  a  report  of  the  Queensland  Meat</span><span>  Board,  which  pointed  ont  that,  un-</span><span>  less  there  was  a  steady  increase  in</span><span>  herdB,  Australia's  home  consump-</span><span>  tion  of  beef  would  have  caught  up</span><span>  with  production  by  the  tune  the</span><span>  population  reached  10,000,000.  A</span><span>  study  along  similar  lines  of  the</span><span>  statistical  position  of  sheep  and</span><span>  dairy  herds  would  be  most  inter-</span><span>  esting,  and  would  possibly-  serve  as</span><span>  a  guide  to  those  responsible  for</span><span>  the  proper  development  of  the</span><span>  primary  industries.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  stock  returns  just  pub-</span><span>  lished,  the  number  of  sheep  in</span><span>  Australia  declined  from  111,038,000</span><span>  to  96,396,000,  since  the  beginning  of</span><span>  1939,  a  reduction  of  12.2  per  cent</span></p> <p><span>  Since  1943  there  has  been  a  contin-</span></p> <p><span>  uous  decline,  and  the  .figure  record-</span><span>  ed  for  this  year  is  the  lowest</span><span>  since  1924.  The  total  number  of</span></p> <p><span>  cattle  declined  during  the  year  end-</span><span>  ed  March  31  by  about  260,000</span><span>  209,000  in  dairy  cattle  and  51,000</span></p> <p><span>  in  beef  cattle.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Statistician  attributes  the</span><span>  falling  off  in  livestock  solely  to</span><span>  drought  conditions.  If  that  were  the</span><span>  case  there  would  be  less  ground  for</span></p> <p><span>  concern  than  if  it  were  traceable</span></p> <p><span>  to  less  obvious  but  more  perman-</span></p> <p><span>  ent  causes.  But  on  the  other  hand</span><span>  Mr  Colin  Clarie  contends  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  severe  drought  alone  has  not  caus-</span><span>  ed  a  reduction  in  three  years  of</span><span>  Queensland's  sheep  by  one  quarter.</span><span>  Another  reason  is  that  graziers</span><span>  are  shifting  from  sheep  to  beef  cat-</span><span>  tle.  The  most  interesting  feature  of</span><span>  livestock  figures  of  recent  years,</span><span>  observes  Mr  Clark,  is  the  evidence</span><span>  that  they  provide  a  tendencv  by</span><span>  producers  to  change  from  dairying</span><span>  and  sheep  grazing  to  the  raising  of</span><span>  beef  -  cattle,  whilst  there  also  has</span><span>  been  a  movement  for  smaller  sheep</span><span>  flocks.  All  the  important  sheep  div-</span><span>  isions,  excepting  one,  are  grazing</span><span>  more  beef  cattle  than  three  years</span><span>  ago,  whereas  their  sheep  numbers</span><span>  have  fallen  by  at  least  21  per  cent</span><span>  and  at  most  by  a  third.  Drought</span><span>  has  certainly  accentuated  the  re-</span><span>  duction  in  sheep  figures  and  it  has</span><span>  affected  the  castle  industry  also,</span><span>  but  only  to  the  extent  of  1.2  below</span><span>  the  1945  figures.</span></p> <p><span>  On  these  figures  the  trend  is  too</span><span>  clearly  marked  to  leave  any  doubt</span></p> <p><span>  as  to  the  existence  of  a  definite</span></p> <p><span>  move  from  sheep  grazing  and  dairy-</span><span>  ing  to  beef  cattle  raising.  What  is</span><span>  the  root  cause  of  the  change?  Is</span><span>  cattle  raising  more  profitable  than</span><span>  dairying  and  wool  growing?  Is  it</span></p> <p><span>  less  trouble?  Have  labour  difficul-</span><span>  ties  anything  to  do  with  it?</span></p> <p><span>  These  and  many  other  vital  quer-</span><span>  ies  at  once  present  themselves,  as</span></p> <p><span>  also  do  the  answers.  To  what  ex-</span><span>  tent  labour  shortages  in  the</span><span>  dairying  industry  and  the  industrial</span></p> <p><span>  troubles  at  the  wool  sheds  are  in-</span><span>  fluencing  dairymen  and  woolgrow</span><span>  ers  to  turn  over  to  cattle  grazing</span><span>  ig  something  that  it  is  most  im-</span><span>  portant  to  find  out.  Another  vital</span><span>  aspect  to  be  discussed  is  whither</span><span>  the  tendency  is  likely  to  lead,  and</span><span>  if  the  ascertained  trend  ia  desir-</span><span>  able?</span></p> <p><span>  It  calls  for  no  wide  range  of  im-</span><span>  agination  for  all  to  realise  that  it</span><span>  will  not  be  a  good  thing  for  AUB-  ?</span><span>  txalU's  future,  in  regar¿  to  popu</span></p> <p><span>  lation,  employment  and  export</span><span>  trade,  if  there  is  to  be  a  contrac-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  of  the^.  wool  growing  and</span><span>  dairying  industries,  and  the  area</span><span>  now  given  over  to.  rural  industries</span><span>  is  to  become  a  huge  cattle  ranch.</span><span>  The  causes  of  the  change  require  to</span><span>  be  closely  examined  by  competent</span><span>  authorities  and  publicly  revealed  so</span><span>  that  a  means  may  be  devised  of</span><span>  checking  the  drift,  in  BO  far  as</span></p> <p><span>  .  such,  check  is  found  to  be  desir-</span><span>  able.</span></p> ",Article,1946-10-16,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1946 STOCK FIGURES",56454469,4,4,"{'score': '5315.0864', 'value': 'very relevant'}",Of far greater concern to the community than may be recognised at first blush are the livestock statistics just issued by the,"{'id': '77', 'value': 'Morning Bulletin (Rockhampton, Qld. : 1878 - 1954)'}",https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/56454469?searchTerm=%27Morning+Bulletin%27,/newspaper/56454469,"Morning Bulletin (Rockhampton, Qld. : 1878 - 1954)",77

The</span><span>  relief  will,  it  is  expected,  be  ou  a</span><span>  graduated  scale  spread  over  all</span><span>  classes  of  wage-earners.  The  prin-</span><span>  cipal  beneficiaries,  however,  will  be</span></p> <p><span>  the  low  and  middle  class  income</span><span>  earners,  with  less  relief  to  the</span><span>  higher  income  groups.  There  is</span><span>  some  uncertainty  as  to  whether</span><span>  the  cuts  will  operate  from  January</span><span>  or  June  and  their  extent  will  not</span><span>  be  known  until  the  Prime  Minister</span><span>  presents  a  supplementary  financial</span><span>  statement  in  the  first  quarter  of</span></p> <p><span>  next  year.</span></p> <p><span>  For  a  pronouncement  evidently</span><span>  designed  to  appease  the  steadily</span><span>  rising  temper  of  the  public  in  the</span><span>  matter  of  taxation,  a  striking  lack</span><span>  of  definiteness  surrounds  the  pro-</span><span>  mise,  and  does  not  enhance  its</span><span>  value.  There  is  a  considerable  time</span><span>  lag  between  January  and  June</span></p> <p><span>  when  it  comes  to  taxes  that  are</span></p> <p><span>  deducted  from  the  weekly  pay  en-</span><span>  velope,  and  it  should  also  have</span><span>  been  possible  to  give  some  clearer</span><span>  notion  of  the  per  centage  reduction</span><span>  contemplated,  in  view  of  the  fact</span><span>  that  Mr  Menzies  some  months  ago</span><span>  was  able  to  make  a  clear-cut  pro-</span><span>  mise  of  a  20  per  cent  reduction  in</span><span>  January,  and  Mr  Fadden  felt  jus-</span><span>  tified  in  going  as  high  a«  28  per</span></p> <p><span>  cent.</span></p> <p><span>  How  it  was  that'  the  Australian</span><span>  electorate  looked  that  gift  horse  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  mouth  will  forever  remain  one</span></p> <p><span>  of  fte  great  unsolved  mysteries.  If</span><span>  it  was  because  they  believed,  with</span><span>  Mr  Chifley,  that  the  revenue  would</span><span>  not  allow  it  to  be  done,  they  have</span><span>  not  had  long  to  wait  to  be  shown</span><span>  how  far  wrong  they  were.  The</span><span>  reason  that  Government  spokesmen</span><span>  are  now  able  to  proclaim  an  im-</span><span>  pending  tax  reduction  is  because</span><span>  each  month  brings  greater  numbers</span><span>  into  the  tax  field,  with  the  result</span><span>  that  revenue  from  direct  taxation</span><span>  is  soaring.

Mr  Chifley</span><span>  has  not  proved  himself  altogether</span><span>  a  wizard  of  finance  and  indeed  at</span><span>  times  has  revealed  a  lack  of  grasp</span></p> <p><span>  -or  was  it  stubbornness-that  has</span></p> <p><span>  made  him  cut  a  far  from  impres-</span><span>  sive  figure  in  this  difficult  field.</span><span>  But  even  if  he  were  a  very  sound</span><span>  Treasurer  he  would  have  been  jus-</span><span>  tified  in  relieving  himself  of  the</span><span>  post,  in  order  to  devote  himself</span><span>  more  freely  to  supervising  general</span><span>  policy  and  coordinating  the  work</span><span>  of  the  new  Ministry.

"<p><span>  O&e  jSonung  Polletti.</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON,</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY.  SEPTEMBER  7,</span></p> <p><span>  1946.</span></p> <p><span>  THOSE  BABIES.</span></p> <p><span>  Australia  wants  babies.  Tba</span><span>  theme  is  evergreen  among  the</span><span>  many  organisations  for  the  better-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  of  motherhood  and  the  care</span></p> <p><span>  of  human  young;  but  it  got  into</span><span>  bad  company  when  is  became  an</span><span>  inspiration  'for  politicians,  short</span><span>  of  a  slogan  designed  artfully  to</span><span>  ensnare  the  female  vote.  It  is</span></p> <p><span>  just,  questionable  if  baby  has  bene-</span><span>  fited  through  mother  having  a</span></p> <p><span>  vote.  If.  such  benefit  is  to  be</span><span>  counted  only  through  maternity</span><span>  bonuses  and  child  endowment,  then</span><span>  we  have  to  confess  that  baby  has</span><span>  been  submerged  under  a  surge  of</span><span>  materialism,  and  that  motlier  is</span><span>  in  danger  of  .  being  swept  .along</span><span>  with  him  into  the  maelstrom.  If</span><span>  we  move  forward  one  stage  in  the</span><span>  progress  of  human  young,  we  come</span><span>  up  against  grim  warnings  from</span><span>  bench  and  pulpit  on  the  growing</span><span>  depravity  of  youth,  as  if  the</span><span>  poison  of  materialism  has  worked</span><span>  through  to  turn  a  wanted  baby</span><span>  into  an  unwanted  culprit.  After</span><span>  all,  baby  will  not  stay  forever</span><span>  young,  and  if  he  imbibes  mater-</span><span>  ialism  with  his  mother's  milk</span><span>  neither  bench  nor  pulpit  should</span><span>  find  itself  startled  into  surprise</span><span>  and  apprehension  at  the  natural</span></p> <p><span>  result.</span></p> <p><span>  Maybe  it  would  be  well  to  con-</span><span>  sider  what  is  the  national  attitude</span><span>  in  Australia  towards  babies,  to</span><span>  which  end  the-  '-'wanted""  columns</span><span>  of  most  daily  newspapers  are  fer-</span><span>  tile  fields  in  which  to  come  upon</span><span>  some  aspects  at  least  of  that</span><span>  national  attitude.  The  story  there</span><span>  is  that  of  all  the  seven  ages  of</span><span>  man,  only  the  first  is  singled  out</span><span>  as  undesirable,  and  we  are  fain  to</span><span>  ask  if  adults  bave  become  intoler-</span><span>  ant  or  if  children  have  become  in-</span><span>  tolerable.  If  ;we  decide  upon  the</span><span>  latter,  we  are  brought  to  decide</span><span>  whether  baby  has  degraded  the</span></p> <p><span>  adult  or  whether  he  has  reached</span></p> <p><span>  his  insufferable  stage  through  the</span></p> <p><span>  moral  cowardice  of  the'  adult!  The</span></p> <p><span>  adult  cannot  avoid  this  issue,  nor</span><span>  can  be  hide  forever  behind  baby</span><span>  depravity  in  a  miserable  effort  to</span><span>  unload'on  to  Junior  the  sins  that</span><span>  are  really  his.</span></p> <p><span>  But  even  this  does  not  answer</span><span>  the  question:  what  is  the  national</span></p> <p><span>  attitude  in  Australia  towards</span><span>  babies?  To  what  extent  do  babies</span><span>  influence  Australian  national  life,</span><span>  and  in  which  way  can  they  be</span></p> <p><span>  said  to  have  enriched  Australian</span><span>  culture?  The  answer  to  this  can-</span><span>  not  be  found  in  clinics  and  creches</span><span>  for  the  well-being  of  baby's  body;</span><span>  nor  in  the  imposing  brick  and</span><span>  mortar  display  of  educational</span><span>  facilities,  replete  with  every  facil-</span><span>  ity  for  barking  his  scholastic</span><span>  shins.  If  any  of  them  take  baby</span><span>  to  their  heart,  it  is  to  a  gritty</span><span>  bosom  nutured  by  political  exped-</span><span>  iency,  .  by  bureaucratic  tyranny</span><span>  and  by  parental  vanity.  At  none</span><span>  of  these  pointe  does'  baby  come</span><span>  into  the  national  picture  for  its</span><span>  own  sake,  but  simply  as  a  means</span><span>  to  inspire  materialistic  gratitude</span><span>  in  parental  hearts  because  of  the</span><span>  mechanical  appliances  for  baby's</span><span>  uplift  and  betterment.  Bench  and</span><span>  pulpit  warn  us,  however,  that</span><span>  along-  that  way  lies  a  dangerous</span><span>  sterility  of  character,  a  path  ill</span><span>  fitted  to  baby.  feet.</span></p> <p><span>  If  baby  is  ""eiitering^into  the</span><span>  national  life  of  Australia,  that</span><span>  fact  should  be  reflected  in  the</span><span>  nation's  literature.  Well,  is  itt</span><span>  We  would  welcome  correction,  but</span><span>  our  impression  is  that  baby  is  as</span><span>  conspicuously  absent  from  Aus-</span><span>  tralian  literature  as  he  is  from</span><span>  most  classical  literature-if  by</span></p> <p><span>  (classical  we  understand  Greek  and</span></p> <p><span>  Latin.  There  is  in  fact  no  Latin</span></p> <p><span>  word  for  ""baby,""  and  only  an</span><span>  unsatisfactory  word  of  neuter  gen-</span><span>  der  in  Greek.  .Even  Homer  .  bas</span><span>  no  noun  expressing  the  idea  of</span><span>  babyhood,  using  instead  an  adjec-</span></p> <p><span>  tive  that  meant  no  more  than</span></p> <p><span>  ""speechless.""  .  The  fact  is  .that</span><span>  classical  literature  on  the  whole</span><span>  has  little  of  romantic  love,  com-</span><span>  paratively  little'  of  romantic  feel-</span><span>  ing,  and  still  less  of  what  inspires</span><span>  in  ns  religious  sentiment.  The  first</span><span>  great-infant  stories-of  Moses  and</span><span>  Samuel-which  have  never  failed</span></p> <p><span>  to  inspire  artists  and  poets,  came!</span><span>  from  the  Hebrew.  Christianity</span><span>  took  over,  from  the  Jews,  that</span><span>  higher  conception  of  motherhood</span><span>  which  distinguishes  them  not  only</span><span>  from  the  Greeks  and  Romans,  but</span><span>  from  other  Orientals.  To  thia</span><span>  was  added  the  story  of  the  Nativ-</span><span>  ity^  so  that  baby  came  into  his</span><span>  own  with  the  growth  of  the  cult</span><span>  of  the  Virgin  Mary,  xhat  is  to</span><span>  say,  until  then,  the  child  was  but</span><span>  the  complement  of  the  mcther,</span><span>  and  neither  the  Greek  nor  the</span></p> <p><span>  Latin  classics  played  any  part  in</span><span>  the  dynamic  change.

This  hardy  an-</span><span>  nual,  side-stepped  when  drought</span><span>  rages  and  shelved  when  rain  ends</span><span>  the  need  for  fodder,  appears  to</span><span>  have  progressed  a  point  further</span><span>  than  usual.  The  advance  is  that</span><span>  certain  recommendations  of  the</span><span>  Standing  Committee  on  Agricul-</span><span>  ture  were  approved  by  the  Aus-</span><span>  tralian  Agricultural  Council  at  its</span><span>  26th  meeting,  which  was  held  in</span><span>  Sydney  last  month.  The  proposal</span><span>  recommended  interest  free  loans  to</span></p> <p><span>  farmers  for  the  production  of  hay,</span><span>  and  considerable  volumes  of  grain</span><span>  held  as  contingent  reserves.</span></p> <p><span>  Assuming  that  a  stock  fodder</span><span>  scheme  is  something  that  will  save</span><span>  the  country's  tremendous  losses</span><span>  from  drought  just  what  form</span><span>  should  it  take?  There  has  been</span><span>  much  talk,  there  have  been  many</span><span>  pla  but  out  of  it  all  no-one  has</span><span>  come  forward  with  a  workable  pro-</span><span>  position,  or  even  one  worthy  of</span><span>  trial.  Several  suggestions  aimed  at</span><span>  the  production  of  fodder  in  favour-</span><span>  ed  areas,  where  it  would  be  stored</span><span>  as  a  drought  emergency.  Irriga-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  has  also  been  tried.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  obvious  that  a  fodder  con-</span><span>  servation  scheme  would  involve  hay</span><span>  and  grain,  but  a  point  that  seems</span><span>  not  to  have  been  considered  is</span><span>  for  what  purpose  the  hay  and</span><span>  grain  be  required?  Would  it  be</span><span>  needed  to  keep  animals  in  full  pro-</span><span>  duction,  or  merely  to  support  them</span></p> <p><span>  in  fair  condition?  When  feed  is</span></p> <p><span>  required  would  it  be  needed  for  a</span><span>  productive,  maintenance,  or  drought</span><span>  ration  in  quality  and  quantity?</span><span>  If  productive,  and  the  need  for  it</span><span>  long,  the  feed  bill  would  be  great-</span><span>  ly  in  excess  of  the  value  of  the</span><span>  production.  If  needed  for  mainten-</span><span>  ance  only,  it  would  be  all  expense</span><span>  with  very  little  income  from  pro-</span><span>  duction,  and  if  a  drought'ration,  it</span><span>  would  be  all  expense  and  no  in-</span><span>  come.  The  answers  to  these  ques-</span><span>  tions  are  well  known-that  is  by</span><span>  the  stockman.  Under  the  existing</span><span>  system  of  livestock  raising  the  first</span><span>  two  are  practical  only  in  rare  cir-</span><span>  cumstances.  The  third  has  put</span><span>  many  enthusiastic  stockmen  in  the</span><span>  hands  of  their  banks,  so  that  years</span><span>  later  when  they  get  their  heads</span><span>  above  water  they  have  a  confirmed</span><span>  belief  that  it  is  more  profitable  tb</span><span>  allow  stock  to  die  than  attempt</span><span>  to  save  them  with  costly  fodder.</span></p> <p><span>  Those  who  had  never  battled</span><span>  with  drought  fail  to  see  why  the</span><span>  stockman  cannot  grow  abundant</span><span>  fodder  to  maintain  his  flock  or</span><span>  herd  in  working  condition  the</span><span>  year  round.  The  fact  that  summer</span><span>  rains  rarely  provide  sufficient</span><span>  pumpkins  or  winter  rains  cabbages</span><span>  for  his  family's  use  is  of  no  sig-</span><span>  nificance.  He  has  the  country,  acres</span><span>  of  it,  and  cheap  too,  and  to  those</span><span>  with  no  stock  knowledge  it  is  a</span><span>  national  disgrace  that  the  stock-</span><span>  man  should  allow  his  animals  u></span><span>  waste  to  slow  death  hy  starvation</span><span>  and  impaction  of  the  rumen  with</span><span>  almost  every  drought.  But  has  the</span><span>  stockman  the  country?  He  may</span><span>  have  it  in  acres,  but  what  about</span><span>  quality  of  soil  in  combination  with</span><span>  agricultural  rainfall?  Acres  cannot</span></p> <p><span>  to  express  quantity  of  land,  and</span><span>  unless  it  has  suitable  quality  back-</span><span>  ed  up  by  propitious  rains  it  is</span><span>  useless  as  a  fodder  proposition.</span><span>  Often  such  land  fails  to  grow  grass</span><span>  of  qualitv  and  in  sufficient  amounts</span><span>  to  sustain  the  stock  grazing  it.</span></p> <p><span>  One  certain  aspect  of  any  fodder</span><span>  growing  scheme  aiming  to  supply</span><span>  bulky  food  is  that  it  must  be</span><span>  highly  mechanised.  The  present</span><span>  day  Bystem  of  cutting,  curing  and</span><span>  harvesting  hay  would  need  to  be</span><span>  revised.  With  basic  costs  as  they</span><span>  are  today  the  whole  system  must</span><span>  be  retooled.  Unless  this  is  done</span></p> <p><span>  the  most  satisfactory  weapon</span><span>  against  drought  losses  would  be,  as</span><span>  in  part  it  always  has  been,  the</span><span>  control  of  herd  and  flock  numbers.</span><span>  Tailenders  must  be  culled  with</span><span>  deep  severity  so  that  those  of  bet-</span><span>  ter  quality  have  a  greater  fighting</span></p> <p><span>  chance.</span></p> <p><span>  fodder.  It  is  a  measure  used</span></p> <p><span>  It  could  be  argued  that  the</span><span>  stockman  has  been  forced  into  ex-</span><span>  ceeding  the  legitimate  carrying</span><span>  capacity  of  his  holding  by  increas-</span><span>  ing  basic  costs.  If  this  is  true,  then</span><span>  a  reduction  in  those  costs  would  be</span><span>  a  drought  fighting  weapon.  Is</span><span>  there*  any  hope  of  such  reduction?</span><span>  If  not  then  drought  mortality  must</span><span>  be  accepted  with  the  same  resigna-</span><span>  tion  as  decomposition  without  pre-</span><span>  servatives,  for  it  would  be  beyond</span></p> <p><span>  control.</span></p> <p><span>  The  better  utilisation  of  grazing</span><span>  myrht  hold  out  some  promise.</span><span>  While  animals  seldom  pass  through</span><span>  a  year  without  grass  in  abundance</span><span>  at  some  neriod,  at  others  they  are</span><span>  desperately  in  need  of  it.  Actually</span><span>  they  utilise  about  one-sixth  of  the</span><span>  annual  croo  .  efficientlv.

One</span><span>  topic  of  discussion  is  to  be  the</span><span>  Bretton  Woods  monetary  stabilisa-</span><span>  tion  agreements,  and  it  is  likely</span><span>  that  the  Chifley  Government  will</span><span>  get  therefrom  its  instructions  con-</span><span>  cerning  such  agreements.</span></p> <p><span>  To  appraise  to  its  full  extent</span><span>  the  financial  bog  into  which  the</span><span>  Chifley  Government  has  subsided</span><span>  it  is  well  to  recall  that  for  years</span><span>  before  the  cessation  of  hostilities</span><span>  post-war  reconstruction  was  being</span><span>  moulded;  if  endless  speeches,  wire-</span><span>  less  discussions,  roaming  commis-</span><span>  sions  and  Ministerial  pronounce-</span><span>  ments  counted  for  anything.  The</span><span>  country  rang  with  slogans  and</span><span>  was  inundated  with  literature.</span><span>  Vast  developmental  schemes  were</span><span>  in  the  air,  private  enterprise  was</span><span>  being  taunted  for  its  lack  of  pre-</span><span>  paredness,  key  men  were  being</span><span>  placed,  lead-in  approaches  were  be-</span><span>  ing  negotiated,  vast  monetary  re</span><span>  serves  were  being  piled  up,  and  all</span><span>  that  was  needed  was  for  the</span><span>  enemy  to  throw  in  his  hand  and</span><span>  the  great  Australian  scheme  of  re-</span><span>  habilitation  would  immediately</span><span>  begin  to  function.</span></p> <p><span>  Well,  th©  war  ended  more  thau</span><span>  a  year  ago,  and  when  the  Capri</span><span>  cornia  Regional  Electricity  Board</span></p> <p><span>  asked  the  Commonwealth  Bank  for</span></p> <p><span>  £1.18  million  at  £3/15/-  per  cent</span><span>  in  order  to  get  on  with  the  work.</span><span>  !  it  was  informed  that  ""the  business</span><span>  will  not  at  present  suit  the  bank.""</span><span>  Nobody  will  argue  that  the  pro-</span><span>  ject  is  unsound.  In  fact,  much</span><span>  time  and  thought  was  devoted  to</span><span>  determining  that  it  was  just  the</span><span>  kind  of  project  to  develop  this  dis-</span><span>  trict  and  open  up  new  opportuni-</span></p> <p><span>  ties  to  demobilised  service  folk.</span><span>  Yet  th©  Commonwealth  Bank,  the</span><span>  be-all  and  end-all  of  Labour  finance</span><span>  fell  down  on  the  job.  lt  is  true</span><span>  that  when  the  board  opened  nego-</span><span>  tiations  with  private  financial  in-</span><span>  stitutions  on  a  basis  of  £3/8/9</span><span>  per  cent  the  Commonwealth  Bank,</span><span>  offered  belatedly  to  reconsider  its</span><span>  former  decision.  Unless  we  are  to</span><span>  assume  that  this  shilly-shallying</span><span>  attitude  of  a  national  banking  in-</span><span>  stitution  towards  post-war  recon-</span><span>  struction  is  reserved  for  this  dis-</span><span>  trict,  it  would  appear  that  the</span><span>  Commonwealth  Bank,  standing  in  a</span><span>  continent  full  of  work  and  vast</span><span>  forces  waiting  to  move  forward,</span><span>  will  not  be  sure  until  after  th*</span><span>  ÂCTU  congress  just  what  will  be</span><span>  its  financial  policy.</span></p> <p><span>  The  keynote  of  financial  policy</span><span>  at  Canberra  for  tbe  defeat  of  in-</span><span>  flation  is  to  bring  about  a  state  of</span><span>  stagnation  -  which  is  also  the</span><span>  Communist  plan.  To  that  end</span><span>  capital  issues  are  choked  off,  share</span><span>  dealing  is  outlawed,  trading  banks</span><span>  are  stultified  and  strangling  taxa-</span><span>  tion  is  maintained.  It  is  like</span><span>  trying  to  reduce  the  temperature  '</span><span>  of  the  patient  by  drowning  him.</span><span>  But  black  markets  flourish  in  such</span><span>  conditions,  in  proof  of  which  the</span><span>  bank  notes  in  circulation  were  still</span><span>  st  en  all-time  high  in  October  last</span><span>  and  £10  million  more  than  Octo-</span><span>  ber  of  last  year.  Like  the  earth</span><span>  thrown  up  at  night  by  the  mole</span><span>  and  visible  next  morning,  just  on</span><span>  £200  million  of  bank  notes  in  cir-</span><span>  culation  and  at  least  90  per  cent  of</span><span>  them  in  the  hands  of  the  public  is</span><span>  an  unfailing  indication  that  vast</span><span>  underground  operations  are  going</span><span>  briskly  forward.  Nothing  thrives  so</span><span>  luxuriantly  or  is  so  hurtful  to  the</span><span>  community,  in  a  set-up  such  as</span><span>  that  imposed  upon  Australia  by</span><span>  the  Chifley  Government  and  ita</span><span>  financial  Brains  Trust,  as  the  black</span><span>  market.  If  the  leaders  of  that</span></p> <p><span>  prosperous  community  do  not  re-</span><span>  member  the  Chifley  Government  in</span><span>  their  prayers,  then  gratitude  is</span><span>  dead,  in  the  land.</span></p> <p><span>  More  than  four  years  ago  (July</span><span>  28,  1842)  we  said,  in  response  to</span><span>  Commonwealth  Bank  protest</span><span>  against  our  suggestion  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  bank  was  coming  under  political</span></p> <p><span>  influence  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""What  we  do  fear,  and  the  manage-</span><span>  ment's  comment  does  not  .dispel  suet</span><span>  fear,  la  that  the  Commonwealth  Bane</span><span>  ls  drifting  towards  that  most  disas-</span><span>  trous  of  financial  institutions  -  t</span><span>  politicians'  bank.  We  reiterate  tha</span><span>  this  may  not  be  the  policy  of  th&lt;</span><span>  Commonwealth  Bank  Board;  but  it  li</span><span>  the  acclaimed  policy  both  of  mud</span><span>  of  the  Curtin  Government  and  o</span><span>  the  trade  unions  powers  from  whlcl</span><span>  such  Government  takes  its  financia</span></p> <p><span>  Instructions.""</span></p> <p><span>  Well,  the  ""acclaimed  policy""  is</span><span>  taking  shape,  in  association  with  a</span><span>  cramped  attitude  towards  expan-</span><span>  sion  financed  by  bank  funds.  Trad-</span><span>  ing  banks  are  being  squeezed  out</span><span>  of  making  advances,  as  indicated</span><span>  by  the  fact  that  in  the  two  finan-</span><span>  cial  years  to  June  last  Common-</span><span>  wealth  Bank  deposits  out  earning</span><span>  interest  increased  by  £10  .S3  mil-</span><span>  lion  while  those  of  the  nine  trading</span><span>  banks  diminished  by  £3.86  million.  I</span><span>  In  June,  1944,  the  Commonwealth  j</span><span>  Bank  held  16  per  cent  of  the</span><span>  £380.55  million  of  non-interest</span><span>  bearing  deposits,  and  onlv  13  per</span><span>  cent  of  the  £477.15  million  of</span><span>  such  deposits  at  the  end  of  June</span><span>  last.  That  is  to  say,  the  Common-</span><span>  wealth  Bank  has  63  per  cent  of  its</span><span>  deposits  earning  interest,  against</span><span>  only  34  per  cent  in  the  case  of  the</span><span>  trading  banks,  which  two  years</span><span>  ago  had  just  on  half  of  their  de-</span><span>  posits  out  at  work.</span></p> <p><span>  One  of  the  striking  indications</span><span>  of  Labour  finance  was  the  failure</span><span>  of  Labour  Governments  to  obtain</span><span>  the  confidence  of  the  people.  Loan</span><span>  after  loan  was  supplied  by  ""big</span><span>  business""  and  topped  off  by  funds</span><span>  from  either  the  Commonwealtt</span><span>  trading  or  savings  banks,  an  outlel</span><span>  denied  the  trading  bank6.  Thus</span><span>  Savings  Bank  money  on  which  de</span><span>  pnsitors  got  an  average  of  slightlj</span><span>  over  1.5  per  cent  goes  ont  on  losi</span><span>  to  the  Government  at  3.5  per  cent</span><span>  Trading  bank  deposits  on  whicl</span><span>  the  Commonwealth  Bank  pays  15s</span><span>  per  cent  also  go  out  on  loan  to  th</span><span>  Government  at  3.5  per  cent,  an</span><span>  Treasury  Bills  on  which  the  Gov</span><span>  eminent  pays  one  per  cent  go  ou</span><span>  to  home  builders  at  3.75  per  cen</span><span>  It  is  clear  that  the  people  ar</span><span>  paying  loan  interest  on  their  ow</span><span>  deposits  in  either  the  Saving</span><span>  Bank  or  Commonwealth  tradin</span><span>  bank,  and  also  on  such  of  thei</span><span>  deposits  in  trading  banks  as  ai</span><span>  taken  over  by  the  Commonwealt</span><span>  Bank.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  JANUARY  9,  1946</span></p> <p><span>  INCIDENT  CLOSED</span></p> <p><span>  I  À  Canberra  message  yesterday</span></p> <p><span>  advised  that  whilst  the  full  Cabi</span></p> <p><span>  net  may  examine  tbs  Bennett</span><span>  report  when  it  meets  on  January</span><span>  17  the  Government  regards  the</span><span>  incident  as  closed.  That  probably</span><span>  is  the  way  those  directly  concerned</span><span>  as  well  as  the  general  public  feel</span><span>  about  it.  General  Gordon  Bennett's</span><span>  escape  from  Singapore  had  become</span><span>  a  matter  that  at  times  approached</span><span>  heated  controversy,  led  to  the</span><span>  washing  of  some  military  linen,</span><span>  and  permitted  the  intrusion  of  a</span><span>  certain  amount  of  personal  feeling,</span><span>  all  of  which  tended  to  exaggerate</span><span>  Its  importance.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Commission's  finding  may</span></p> <p><span>  fall  somewhat  short  of  what  was  [</span></p> <p><span>  desired  by  those  of  strong</span></p> <p><span>  opinions  on  either  side,  but  Gene-j</span></p> <p><span>  ral  Bennett  has  expressed  satis-  j</span><span>  faction  with  the  result,  and  if</span><span>  there  are  others  holding  different</span><span>  views  no  purpose  can  ba  served</span><span>  by  carrying  them  any  further.</span><span>  Mr  Justice  Ligertwood's  findings</span><span>  are  carefully  balanced.  The  ques-</span></p> <p><span>  tions  which  he  was  asked  io  answer</span><span>  «rere  :  Whether  at  the  time  General</span></p> <p><span>  Bennett  relinquished  his  command</span><span>  and  left  Singapore  he  had  the  per-</span><span>  mission  of  any  competent  authority</span><span>  for  such  action  ;  whether  he  was</span><span>  at  any  material  time  a  prisoner</span><span>  of  war  ;  whether  at  the  time  ho</span><span>  lelinquished  his  command  it  was</span><span>  his  duty  to  remain  with  the  forces</span><span>  under  his  command;  whether  in</span><span>  all  the  circumstances  he  was  jus-</span><span>  tified  in  relinquishing  his  com*</span><span>  mand  and  leaving  Singapore  î</span></p> <p><span>  The  Commission's  findings  are</span><span>  that  General  Bennett  did  not  have</span><span>  the  permission  of  any  competent</span><span>  authority,  but  there  was  in  fact</span><span>  no  competent  authority  who  could</span><span>  give  him  permission  to  leave.  At</span><span>  the  time  he  left  Singapore  he  waa</span><span>  not  a  prisoner  of  war  in  the  sense</span><span>  of  being  a  soldier  who  was  under</span><span>  a  duty  to  escape.

The  escape  was  a  hazardous</span><span>  enterprise  and  involved  no  reflec-</span><span>  tion  on  General  Bennett's  personal</span><span>  courage.  The  General  did  in  fact</span><span>  bring  back  valuable  information</span><span>  to  Australia  which  was  used  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  training  of  the  AIF  in  jungle</span><span>  warfare.

Th«</span><span>  squatter  of  1046  is  one  who  instate</span><span>  himself,  his  wife,  family,  goods</span><span>  and  chattels  in  an  unoccupied</span><span>  Government  hufldiug  and  refuses</span></p> <p><span>  to  be  evicted.

At  present,</span><span>  the  invasion  of  buildings  for  use</span><span>  as  tenements  in  restricted  to  un-</span><span>  used  military  hutments  and  hos-</span><span>  pitals,  and  whilst  it  is  confined</span><span>  to  this  field  there  is  a  good  deal</span><span>  of  public  sympathy  with  the  squat-</span><span>  ters.  But  the  line  between  public</span><span>  and  privately-owned  is  thinly</span><span>  drawn.  When  there  are  no  longer</span><span>  unused  military  huts  and  hos-</span><span>  pitals  to  invade  will  the  squatters</span><span>  pass  by  temporarily  unused  priv-</span></p> <p><span>  ate  establishments?</span></p> <p><span>  And  will  the  squatters  be  con-</span><span>  fined  to  the  homeless  f  Unscrupu-</span><span>  lous  people,  and  there  are  plenty</span><span>  of  them  about,  might  sot  hesi-</span><span>  tate  about  leaving  their  present</span><span>  habitations  for  something  more</span><span>  pretentious.

No  suggestion  is</span><span>  made  that  the  affairs  of  the  League</span><span>  have  not  been  well  directed  in  be-</span><span>  tween  wars;  in  fact,  the  contrary</span><span>  must  be  the  case  or  there  would</span><span>  not  have  been  so  few  changes</span><span>  throughout  the  organisation  in  the</span><span>  long  period  that  has  elapsed  since</span><span>  the  League  settled  down.  Sir  Gil-</span><span>  bert  Dyett  will  be  a  severe  loss  to</span><span>  the  organisation,  but  the  loss  will</span><span>  be  tempered  by  the  fact  that  he</span><span>  will  be  available  to  give,  as  he</span><span>  tactfully  puts  it,  ""all  the  help  that</span><span>  the  new  men  may  desire.""</span></p> <p><span>  Sir  Gilbert  realises  what  must  be</span><span>  plain  to  all  who  give  thought  to</span><span>  the  matter,  that  the  problem  of</span><span>  ex-servicemen  and  women  from</span><span>  Inow  on  will  be  something  far</span><span>  different  and  more  complex  to  that</span><span>  which  faced  the  old  League.  It</span><span>  will  call  for  freshness  of  mind,  and</span><span>  vigour  and  skill  in  negotiation.</span></p> <p><span>  The  time  to  marshall  the  forces</span></p> <p><span>  which  will  carry  the  responsibility</span><span>  is  now  whilst  demobilisation  is  in</span><span>  progress  and  not  five  years  hence.</span></p> <p><span>  How  to  meet  the  situation  can</span></p> <p><span>  safely  be  left  to  servicemen  who</span><span>  are  showing  a  lively  interest  in</span></p> <p><span>  their  own  affairs.</span></p> <p><span>  The  course  followed  by  Sir  Gil-</span><span>  bert  Dyett  has  wider  implications.</span></p> <p><span>  We  are  on  the  threshold  of  a  new</span><span>  era  when  large  numbers  of  men</span><span>  and  women  have  to*  make  a  fresh</span><span>  start  in  life;  hence  it  can  be  seri-</span><span>  ously  contended  that  there  are</span><span>  many  organisations  other  than  that1</span><span>  of  ex-servicemen  which  can  do  with</span><span>  new  direction.  Nowhere  has  this</span><span>  stronger  application  than  in  the</span><span>  legislatures,  upon  which  so  much</span><span>  wül  depend  in  the  future,  and  no-</span></p> <p><span>  where  is  there  more  reluctance  to</span><span>  a  change  in  the  representation.  It</span><span>  would  be  difficult  to  find  many</span><span>  commercial'enterprises  in  the  same</span><span>  hands  that  directed  them  20  years</span><span>  ago;  yet  in  the  parliamentary</span><span>  sphere  the  same  men  who  were  re-</span><span>  turned  thirty  years  back  still  cling</span><span>  to  their  posts  though  their  outlook</span><span>  is  practically  unchanged  from  that</span><span>  which  first  earned  their  election  as</span><span>  young  men.  That  a  change  long</span><span>  since  would  have  been  beneficial  is</span><span>  not  disputed  even  by  their</span><span>  supporters,  but  there  seems  no  way</span><span>  of  bringing  it  about  short  of  vol-</span><span>  untary  retirement,  and  this  is</span><span>  looked  upon  as  altogether  too  much</span><span>  to  expect.</span></p> <p><span>  The  tendency  to  cling  to  posts</span><span>  of  responsibility  extends  beyond</span><span>  the  parliamentary  sphere.  Many</span><span>  public  and  semi-pnblic  bodies  -re-</span><span>  tain  their  heads  far  beyond</span><span>  the  period  when  they  should  have</span><span>  made  way.  Often  it  is  because  of</span><span>  an  erroneous  impression  that  there</span><span>  ia  no  one  capable  of  taking  their</span><span>  place,  and  it  is  only  when  someone</span><span>  shows  sufficient  energy  and  courage</span><span>  to  break  the  tie  that  everyone</span><span>  realises  it  should  have  been  done</span><span>  long  before</span></p> <p><span>  In  no  sphere  would  a  few  volun-</span><span>  tary  retirements  in  favour  of</span><span>  younger  men  with  a  fresh  outlook</span><span>  on  the  problems  of  the  times  be</span><span>  more  beneficial  than  in  the  con-</span><span>  duct  of  Australia's  industrial</span><span>  unionism.  These  posts  are  in  the</span><span>  hands-  of  men  who  have  not  ad-</span><span>  vanced  in  thought  beyond  the</span><span>  period  when  the  only  means  of</span><span>  dealing  with  industrial  disputes</span><span>  was  the  strike  weapon.  Not  only</span><span>  do  they  not  retire  but  it  seems  to</span><span>  be  impossible  to  remove  them  by</span><span>  ordinary  methods  of  election.</span></p> <p><span>  Throughout  Australian  public</span><span>  life  there  is  a  need  to  follow  the</span><span>  example  of  Sir  Gilbert  Dyett  in</span><span>  voluntarily  retiring  from  the</span><span>  Presidency  of  the  Returned  Sol-</span><span>  diers*  League.  New  men  with  new</span><span>  ideas  are  wanted,  particularly  men</span><span>  whose  ideas  tend  to  a  realisation</span><span>  that  the  future  of  Australia  must</span><span>  depend  more  than  anything  else</span><span>  on  a  spirit  of  cooperation  amongst</span><span>  all  classes  rather  than  the  spirit  of</span><span>  antagonism  which  i8  uppermost  at</span></p> <p><span>  the  moment.</span></p> ",Article,1946-02-27,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1946.

From  the</span><span>  opening  in  1901  to  1927  white  and</span><span>  coloured  patients  had  their  own</span><span>  kitchens,  but  from  then  to  estab-</span><span>  lishment  of  Fantome  leprosarium</span><span>  white  men  and  women  from  all</span><span>  stations  in  life  were  brought  into</span><span>  intimate  contact  with  aboriginals,</span><span>  whose  only  common  ground  was</span><span>  their  malady.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr  Foley  told  the  House  the</span><span>  other  day  that  ""  consistent  with  the</span><span>  supply  of  lábour  and  material,  Peel</span><span>  Island  would  be  made  just  as  com-</span><span>  fortable  as  the  mainland.""  He  ia</span><span>  24  years  late,  as  the  annual  report</span><span>  on  this  institution  for  1922  stated</span><span>  in  no  uncertain  terms  that  all</span><span>  that  was  possible  to  this  end  had</span><span>  then  been  done.

We</span></p> <p><span>  learned  with  mixed  feelings  the</span><span>  other  day  of  murderers  serving</span><span>  their  sentence  on  parole  on  a  prison</span><span>  farm  ;  we  also  learned  of  the  rigid</span><span>  rule  that  no  patient  on  Feel  Island</span><span>  may  be  in  telephone  communica-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  with  the  outer  world.</span></p> <p><span>  Leprosy  in  Queensland  is  in  a</span><span>  different  category  from  that  in</span><span>  Victoria  and  New  South  Wales.</span><span>  Although  all  States  carry  an  al-</span><span>  most  pure  British  stock  from  a</span><span>  land  where  the  malady  is  unknown</span><span>  other  than  by  importation,  and  all</span><span>  of  them  had  large  numbers  of  in-</span><span>  fected  Chinese  gold  diggers,  its</span><span>  spread  among  the  white  popula-</span><span>  tion  has  been  vastly  different.  No</span><span>  case  is  known  of  the  disease  being</span><span>  contracted  in  Victoria,  it  was  con-</span><span>  tracted  only  for  a  time  in  Kev</span><span>  South  Wales,  but  in  Queensland</span><span>  ""  with  an  exactly  similar  prophy-</span><span>  lactic  system""  leprosy  is  increas-</span><span>  ing  steadily.  Then  again,  under  a</span><span>  system  of  voluntary  prophylaxie</span><span>  in  Norway  the  leper  population</span><span>  was  reduced  by  83  per  cent  in  ft!</span><span>  years  to  1920,  whereas  under  tnt</span><span>  stringent  laws  of  Queensland  th«</span><span>  leper  population  was  nearly  treble*</span><span>  tn  the  25  years  to  1920.  \  Thea«</span><span>  baffling  facts  should  stimulate  ai</span><span>  least  curiosity  rather  than  product</span><span>  official  inertia.

He  thus  gave  the</span><span>  Arbitration  Court  one  reason  for  re-  j</span><span>  fusing  to  increase  that  wage.  He  also</span><span>  held  fast  to  wage-pegging  as  part</span></p> <p><span>  of  price  control,  a  war-time  mea-  j</span></p> <p><span>  sure  for  which  there  would  have</span><span>  been  more  justification  if  Labour</span><span>  politicians  had  not  ignored  it  to</span><span>  raise  their  own  pay,  and  if  black</span><span>  marketeers  had  not  flourished  be-</span></p> <p><span>  yond  all  belief.  Joining  the  general</span><span>  demand  for  a  measure  of  relaxation</span><span>  of  controls  Communists  stole  the</span><span>  official  Labour  Party  show  and</span><span>  campaigned  vigorously  for  the  40</span><span>  hour  week,  abolition  of  wage-peg-</span><span>  ging,  increase  of  £1  in  the  basic</span><span>  wage,  removal  of  the  means  test,</span><span>  increased  pensions  and.  sundries,</span><span>  and  whoever  it  is  that  grants  all</span><span>  or  any  of  these  things  the  Com-</span><span>  munists  will  claim  the  credit.  Be-</span><span>  tween  Mr  Menzies'  pre-election</span><span>  promises  and  the  Communists'</span><span>  post-election  demands  Mr  Chifley  is</span><span>  unable  to  make  concessions  to  suf-</span><span>  fering  taxpayers  without  appear-</span><span>  ing  to  be  surrendering  to  one  or</span></p> <p><span>  the  other.</span></p> <p><span>  Meanwhile,  the  Arbitration</span><span>  Court  has  been  summoned  hur-</span></p> <p><span>  riedly  to  bear  the  brunt  of  pacify-</span><span>  ing  the  squalling  infant,  which  is</span><span>  afflicted  with  a  heavy  rash  of</span><span>  Communist-sponsored  strikes  as  an</span><span>  aid  to  the  Court  to  make  up  its</span><span>  mind.  The  unions  want  war-time</span><span>  loadings  to  remain  as  a  spring-</span><span>  board  for  higher  flights  of  wages,</span><span>  just  as  the  seamen  wanted  war  dan-</span><span>  ger  loading  to  remain  after  the  dan-</span><span>  gers  ended.  The  Court  is  also  to</span><span>  look  into  the  list  of  legal  prices,</span><span>  while  Mr  Chifley  and  his  disciples</span><span>  try  to  perpetuate  thé  legend  that</span><span>  goods  can  be  'got  at  those  or  any</span><span>  other  prices.  Consumers  all  over</span><span>  Australia  of  every  form  of  consum-</span><span>  able  goods  could  tell  Mr  Chifley</span><span>  that  without  bothering  the  Court,</span><span>  which  has  enough  on  its  hands,  in</span><span>  the  form  of  abandoned  basic  wage</span><span>  theories,  to  keep  it  busy.  First  the</span><span>  basic  wage  was  fixed  on  the  sum</span><span>  needed  for  a  family  of  four-five</span><span>  in  some  States-to  live  decently;</span><span>  then  it  was  paid  to  single  men</span><span>  with  no  family-  to  keep;  then  it</span><span>  was  decreed  to  be  based  upon  the</span><span>  j  amount  that  Australian  industry</span></p> <p><span>  could  stand,  after  which  child  en</span><span>  !  dowment  after  the  first  child  was</span></p> <p><span>  added  to  try  to  lift  the  family</span></p> <p><span>  man's  head  above  the  waters  ol</span><span>  oblivion;  and  now  we  are  told  that</span><span>  the  Court  is  to  take  into  account</span><span>  the  ability  of  the  community  tc</span><span>  pay.  On  top  of  this,  Communist</span><span>  ridden  unions  from  Cairns  to  Perth</span><span>  are  stressing  urgency  in  the  set-</span><span>  tlement  of  their  demands,  Court</span><span>  or  no  Court,  devoting  to  the  urg-</span><span>  ing  slightly  better  than  three</span><span>  quarters  of  a  million  man-days  it</span><span>  the  three  months  to  the  end  ol</span><span>  October  last.</span></p> <p><span>  What  Mr  Chifley  hopes  that  th«</span><span>  Arbitration  Court  will  evolve  oui</span><span>  of  the  riddle  amazing  tangle  ol</span><span>  jettisoned  economic  principles  ii</span><span>  perhaps  that  it  will  distract  atten-</span><span>  tion  from  his  policy  of  inertia  ii</span><span>  a  world  of  movement,  his  dead</span><span>  hand  on  the  affairs  of  a  country  oj</span><span>  widely  divergent  interests-  If  ii</span><span>  achieves  that  it  will  serve  Mr  Chif</span><span>  ley  far  better  than  it  serves  Aus-</span><span>  tralia,  whose  commerce  is  in  th&lt;</span><span>  doldrums,  and  whose  economic  po</span><span>  sition  through  arrested  animatioi</span><span>  is  growing  steadily  worse.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY.  APRIL  3,  1946.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  GOVERNORSHIP</span></p> <p><span>  From  time  to  time  there  out-</span><span>  crops  a  mild  controversy  over  the</span><span>  appointment  of  Australian  State</span><span>  Governors,  the  point  of  debate  re-</span><span>  volving  round  whether  the  holder</span><span>  of  the  office  should  be  'imported""</span><span>  from  England  or  selected  in  Aus-</span><span>  tralia.  The  subject  is  not  one  on</span><span>  which  the  majority  of  people  have</span><span>  any  strong  feelings,  preferring  to</span><span>  leave  the  local  politicians  and  those</span><span>  at  Downing  Street  argue  it  out</span></p> <p><span>  to  their  satisfaction.  Yet  if  a</span><span>  vote  were  taken  it  most  likely</span><span>  would  reveal  a  substantial  major-</span><span>  ity  in  favour  of  continuing  the</span><span>  practice'of  filling  the  office  with  an</span><span>  outside  appointee.  In  this  con-</span><span>  nexion  it  might  be  worth  while  to</span></p> <p><span>  take  one  of  those  ""straw""  ballots</span><span>  which  are  so  popular  nowadays,</span><span>  just  to  ascertain  what  the  people</span></p> <p><span>  as  a  whole#do  really  think  about</span></p> <p><span>  the  matter.</span></p> <p><span>  The  governorship  is  not  an  ex-</span><span>  ecutive  office,  nor  is  it  a  purely</span><span>  ornamental  post.  Apart  from  the</span><span>  link  with  the  Crown,  of  which  he</span><span>  is  the  symbol,  the  State  Governor</span><span>  can  be  ,of  great  service  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  State  in  which  he  functions.</span><span>  Queensland  has  been  the  richer</span><span>  for  having  had  amongst  its  ""im-</span><span>  ported""  governors  men  of  great</span><span>  ability  and  influence  which  they</span><span>  have  exercised  in  many  fields  to</span><span>  the  advantage  of  the  State  and</span><span>  its  people.  Sir  William  Mac-</span><span>  Gregor,  Sir  Matthew  Nathan  and</span><span>  Sir  Leslie  Wilson  learned  more</span><span>  about  Queensland,  and  used  that</span><span>  knowledge  to  its  advantage  in</span><span>  many  ways,  than  most  of  the  men</span><span>  elected  to  administrative  office</span><span>  who  had  spent  a  lifetime  here.</span></p> <p><span>  Much  is  made  by  those  who  ad-</span><span>  vocate  a  break  with  traditional</span><span>  custom,  of  the  desirability  of  ap-</span><span>  pointing  a  local  governor  because</span><span>  of  his  greater  knowledge  of  local</span><span>  conditions.  It  does  not  occur  to</span></p> <p><span>  them  that  a  comparatively  young</span><span>  country  that  has  reached,  our  stage</span><span>  of  development  has  quite  a  lot  to</span><span>  gain  from  the  impact  of  men  who</span><span>  can  bring  a  few  outside  ideas  .along</span><span>  with  them.  There  is  no  reason  to</span><span>  expect  that  a  local  appointee  would</span><span>  perform  the  office  with  any  greater</span></p> <p><span>  degree  of  ability,  and  if  it  is  in-  !</span></p> <p><span>  tended  to  make  it  a  sinecure  for</span><span>  worn-out  politicians  it  would  soon</span><span>  lose  the  dignity  and  respect  that</span><span>  is  now  associated  with  the  office.</span></p> <p><span>  The  suggestion  that  it  ls  one  of</span><span>  the  rewards  which  should  go  to</span><span>  Australians  who  have  distinguished</span><span>  themselves  in  public  service  is  dis-</span><span>  posed  of  by  the  small  use  that  is</span><span>  often  made  of  some  men  who;have</span><span>  achieved  the  greatest  stature,  in</span></p> <p><span>  public  life.  Mr  S.  M.  Bruc¿  for-</span></p> <p><span>  mer  Prime  Minister  and  Histo  Com-</span><span>  missioner  in  London  daring,  the</span><span>  war  years,  and  acknowledged  to</span><span>  be  one  of  the  biggest  men  the  Em-</span><span>  pire  has  produced  in  the  present</span><span>  century,  is  to  return  to  England</span><span>  as  a  private  citizen  because  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  has  no  use  for  him.  It  is  on</span><span>  the  .  cards  that  Mr  Casey,  selected</span><span>  for  high  and  responsible  posts  in</span><span>  the  most  critical  days  confronting</span><span>  the  Empire,  will  probably  find  him-</span><span>  self  m  a  similar  position.  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  has  not  shown  a  disposition</span></p> <p><span>  to  go  out  after  big  men  with  broad</span><span>  ideas,  and  the  attitude  taken  on</span><span>  the  question  of  the  Governorship</span></p> <p><span>  is  another  manifestation  of  the</span><span>  tendency.  It  is  impossible  to  es-</span><span>  cape  the  suspicion  that  the  under-</span><span>  lying  motive  behind  the  advocacy</span><span>  of  iocally-raised  governors  is  to  j</span></p> <p><span>  provide  another  job  for  spent  j</span></p> <p><span>  politicians.</span></p> <p><span>  The  appointment  of  a  new  gov-</span><span>  ernor  for  New  South  Wales,  which</span><span>  has  hung  fire  for  a  long  time  owing</span><span>  to  failure  of  the  State  Labour</span><span>  Government  and  Londqn  to  reach</span><span>  an  agreement,  has  been  solved  by</span><span>  the  appointment  of  Lieut-General</span><span>  Northcott,  a  Victorian  by  birth</span></p> <p><span>  and  residence.  He  is  the  first</span><span>  Australian-born  holder  of  the  office</span></p> <p><span>  of  State  Governor.  By  his  ap-</span><span>  pointment  the  N.S.W.  Cabinet  has</span><span>  carried  the  point  of  not  having  an</span><span>  outsider  appointed.  It  remains  to</span><span>  be  seen  whether  this  is  merely  the</span><span>  thin  end  of  a  wedge  and  in  making</span><span>  the  next  appointment  departure  is</span><span>  made  from  selecting  one  whose</span><span>  recommendation  is  distinguished</span><span>  service  to  the  country,  to  one</span><span>  whose  claim  rests  on  distinguished</span><span>  service  to  the  Party.</span></p> <p><span>  Queensland  likewise  is  faced  with</span></p> <p><span>  the  task  of  filling  the  vacancy  at</span><span>  Government  House  caused  by  the</span><span>  pending  departure  o/  Sir  Leslie</span><span>  Wilson.  It  may  have  been  hoped</span><span>  to  gain  a  helpful  lead  from  what</span><span>  happened  in  N.R.W.,  but  if  that</span><span>  was  so  little  aid  could  have  been</span><span>  derived  from  the  event.  It  took  a</span><span>  long  time  to  find  Lieut-General</span><span>  Northcott,  and  his  type  is  in  rather</span><span>  short  supply.  If  the  Queensland</span><span>  Government  can  find  an  Australian</span><span>  of  distinction  to  succeed  Sir  Leslie</span></p> <p><span>  Wilson,  the  appointment  will  be</span><span>  welcomed  by  the  people  of  the</span><span>  State.  On  thc  other  hand,  if  an</span><span>  appointment  is  made  from  overseas</span><span>  there  will  be  no  lack  of  warmth</span><span>  in  the  reception  accorded  the  new</span><span>  governor.  What  everyone  hopes</span><span>  excepting  perhaps  those  who  may</span><span>  consider  they  stand  in  line  for</span><span>  selection  if  the  field  is  narrowed</span><span>  to  local  nominees-is  that  if  nn</span><span>  Australian  does  get  the  post  h*</span><span>  will  be  one  who  is  free  of  political</span><span>  entanglements.  Otherwise  the</span><span>  office  of  State  Governor  will  cease</span><span>  to  have  the  meanin?  it  has  held</span><span>  in  the  past  for  the  people  of</span></p> <p><span>  Queensland.</span></p> ",Article,1946-04-03,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON WEDNESDAY, APRIL 3, 1946.

Mr.  Forde  is  pro</span><span>  viding  some  evidence  on  that  point.</span><span>  In  addition  to  a  torrent  of  elee</span><span>  tion  matter  turned  out  by  a  num</span><span>  erous  secretarial  staff  he  has  taken</span><span>  to  making  almost  daily  pronounce</span><span>  ments  on  matters  calculated  to  as</span><span>  sist  him  in  making  good  with</span><span>  electors.</span></p> <p><span>  It  so  happens  that  some  of  these</span><span>  pronouncements  have  not  alto</span><span>  gether  endeared  him  to  Labour</span><span>  colleagues  in  the  State  Parlia</span><span>  ment,  whose  proviace  he  has  in</span><span>  vaded.  It  is  claimed  that  the  state</span><span>  ment  made  by  Mr  Fo-rde  about  the</span><span>  water  conservation  projects,  said</span><span>  to  be  in  contemplation  for  Queens</span><span>  land,  should  have  been  made  by</span><span>  the  State  Minister  for  Lands.</span><span>  Confirmation  of  this  may  be  gath</span><span>  ered  from  happenings  in  the  Fed</span><span>  eral  Parliament  at  almost  the</span><span>  identical  moment.  Whilst  Mr  Forde</span><span>  was  boasting  of  what  the  Federal</span><span>  Government  was  proposing  to  do</span><span>  about  irrigation  in  Queensland,  Mr</span><span>  Corses  was  trying  to  secure  the</span><span>  adjournment  of  the  Hodse  to  dis</span><span>  cuss  what  Mr  Fordes  government</span><span>  had  not  done  about  it,  and'  was</span><span>  brusquely-  sat  upon  by  both  the</span><span>  Prime  Minister  and  the  Minister</span><span>  for  Post-war  Reconstruction  on</span><span>  the  ground  that  primarily  this  was</span><span>  a  State  and  not  a  Federal  mat</span><span>  ter,  Following  his  water  conserv</span><span>  ation?  statement  Mr  Forde  issued</span><span>  another  on  the  wonderful  possi</span><span>  bilities  of  the  Blair  Athol  open</span><span>  cut  as  a  means  of  creating  nen</span><span>  industries.

It  is  as  true  that  there</span><span>  are  now  many  things  to  talk</span><span>  about  Its  it  is  that  Australia  has</span><span>  an  army  of  indefatigable  talkers;</span><span>  but  the  idea  that  Australia  can</span><span>  be  talked  out  of  her  constitutional,</span><span>  economic  and  industrial  difficulties</span></p> <p><span>  is  as  futile  as  believing  that  she</span><span>  be  floated  out  of  them  by  printing</span></p> <p><span>  money.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  to  be  a  High  Commis-</span><span>  sioner  at  Brazil,  'to  which  over  the</span><span>  five  years  to  1939  Australia  ex-</span><span>  ported  nothing,  and  there  is  to  be</span><span>  one  at  Chile  that,  together  with</span><span>  Peru,  took  from  Australia  over  thp</span><span>  same  period  only  2s.  6d.  worth  of</span><span>  exports  in  every  £100  of  our  total</span><span>  exports.

It  is</span></p> <p><span>  figure  of  speech  to  allude  to  pracf</span><span>  itally  every  election  as  ""the  mot</span><span>  momentous  in  the  nation's  hi</span><span>  tory.""

Ha,  is  to  follow,  and  that  de</span><span>  termination  will  influence  tb</span><span>  whole  economic  and  social  life  a</span><span>  the  people  of  this  continent.  Tha</span><span>  there  is  recognition  of  this  is  su|</span><span>  gee  ted  in,  many  ways,  not  th</span><span>  least  being  a  growing  conscious</span><span>  ness  amongst  many  people,  usually</span><span>  apathetic  to  these  things,  that  poli</span><span>  tics  do  bear  intimately  on  thei</span><span>  daily  lives.</span></p> <p><span>  One  indication  of  the  toughnes:</span><span>  of  the  political  fight  that  lie</span></p> <p><span>  ahead  is  to  be  discerned  in  th&lt;</span><span>  prominence  given  to  early  electioi</span><span>  forecasts  now  current.  .In  a  broac</span></p> <p><span>  sense  elections  are  more  easily  pre</span><span>  dictable  than  most  things  in  whicl</span><span>  the  element  of  uncertainty  resides</span><span>  It  is  rare  indeed  that  the  elector</span><span>  ite  springs  a  complete  surprise  01</span><span>  the  pre-voting  assessors.  Evei</span><span>  when  landslides  have  occurred,  thej</span><span>  have  only  accentuated  an  expectec</span><span>  swing  in  one  direction  or  the  other</span></p> <p><span>  That  occurred  at  the  last  election</span></p> <p><span>  As  polling  day  approached  observ-</span></p> <p><span>  ers  became  aware  that  Mr  Curtie</span><span>  personally  was  exercising  a  tre-</span><span>  mendous  influence  on  the  electorate</span><span>  as  a  whole.  This  trend  reached  ita</span><span>  peak  by  polling  day  with  results</span><span>  that  took  a  good  many  people  by</span><span>  surprise,  not  the  least  being  some</span><span>  Government  followers.  It  was  said</span><span>  the  most  astonished  man  in  Bris-</span><span>  bane  at  the  vote  Mr  Lawson  re-</span><span>  ceived  was  Mr  Lawson.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  of  significance  and  worth;</span><span>  of  mention  here  that  the  one  elec-</span><span>  torate  in  all  Australia  which  did</span><span>  not  synchronise  with  the  landslide</span><span>  was  Capricornia.  In  proportion  to</span><span>  others  Labour  should  have  had  a</span><span>  majority  of  12,000  to  14,000,  in-</span><span>  stead  of  which  Mr  Forde  lost</span><span>  ground.  That  fact  can  hardly  be</span><span>  ignored  in  any  assessment  of  pros-</span><span>  pects  of  the  coming  election-  That</span><span>  Capricornia  has  been  placed  on</span><span>  the  list  of  seats  doubtful  for  the</span><span>  Government  is  by  no  means  a  far</span><span>  fetched  idea,  and  that  Mr  Forde</span><span>  is  not  one  of  those  who  might</span><span>  consider  it  far-fetched  is  attested</span><span>  by  the  assiduity  with  which  he  has</span><span>  cultivated  his  constituents  for</span><span>  some  time  past,  and  the  heavy  re-</span><span>  inforcements  he  is  calling  to  hi?</span><span>  aid.  It  is  true  he  has  not  called</span><span>  up  Mr  Chifley  but  that  is  probably</span><span>  due  to  the  necessity  of  having  the</span><span>  commander  at  other  points  where</span></p> <p><span>  the  line  is  considered  to  be  even</span></p> <p><span>  weaker.</span></p> <p><span>  In  respect  of  current  election</span><span>  forecasts,  few  governments  have</span><span>  gone  to  the  country  for  a  renewal</span><span>  of  confidence  in  a  more  favourable</span><span>  position  as  regards  numbers.  Out</span><span>  of  75  seats  in  the  House  of  Repre-</span><span>  sentatives  Mr  Chifley  holds  49  as</span><span>  against  20  controlled  by  the  com-</span><span>  bined  Opposition  parties.  This</span><span>  means  that  the  Opposition  has  to</span><span>  win  13  seats.  Labour  organisers</span></p> <p><span>  I  hold  that  such  a  wide  swing</span><span>  !  against  the  Government  is  ""im-</span><span>  possible.""  It  is,  of  course  not</span><span>  impossible,  but  it  will  call  for  a</span><span>  turnover  that  is  not  often  achiev-</span><span>  ed.  Yet  Liberal  party  representa</span><span>  fives  claim  that  they  wai  win</span><span>  I  twelve  seats  from  Labour  and  that</span></p> <p><span>  the  Country  Party  will  gain  four</span><span>  more.  Country  Party  prophets</span><span>  raise  the  estimated  number  of</span><span>  seats  they  will  win  to  six.</span></p> <p><span>  On  what  are  these  optimistic  esti-</span><span>  mates  based,  and  at  what  points</span><span>  i?  the  break  through  anticipated?</span><span>  Wishful  thinking  is  of  no  use.  The</span><span>  Liberal  forecasters  declare  that</span><span>  the  turnover  will  be  brought  about</span><span>  by  a  widespread  resentment  against</span><span>  the  big  strikes  that  have  brought</span><span>  about  dislocation  of  industry  all</span><span>  over  the  Commonwealth,  and  the</span><span>  weak  line  taken  by  the  Government</span><span>  towards  the  Communists,  who  are</span><span>  the  chief  trouble-makers.  Other</span><span>  factors  are  considered  to  be  the</span><span>  lag  in  many  post-war  plan»  which</span><span>  should  have  been  further  advanced,</span><span>  particularly  home  building.  The</span><span>  shortage  of  goods,  high  prices  and</span><span>  disappointing  amount  of  tax  reduc-</span><span>  tion  are  other  things  that  have</span><span>  turned  the  people  against  th»  Gov-</span></p> <p><span>  ernment.</span></p> <p><span>  These  are  the  things  which,  it</span><span>  is  reckoned,  will  lever  the  Chifley</span><span>  Government  out  of  office.  Where</span><span>  are  they  most  likely  to  be  mani-</span><span>  fested?  Political  observers  believe</span><span>  they  have  the  key  to  the  answer</span><span>  in  the  Prime  Minister's  election</span></p> <p><span>  itinerary,  just  announced.-Balla-  j</span></p> <p><span>  rat  and  Wannon  in  Victoria,  Bath</span><span>  py  and  Wakefield  in  South  Aus-</span><span>  tralia,  Denison  and  Bass  in  South</span><span>  Australia,  Griffith  and  Lilley  in</span><span>  Queensland,  three  West  Australian</span><span>  scats  and  four  country  and  four</span><span>  metropolitan  seats  in  NSW  are</span><span>  specifically  named.

Australia  lay</span><span>  far  from  the  scene  of  possible  con-</span><span>  flict,  and  other  than  for  nuisance</span><span>  value  it  would  not  pay  a  European</span><span>  enemy  to  journey  12,000  miles</span><span>  merely  to  attack  us.

It  was  Tokyo  and</span><span>  not  Canberra  which  decided  if  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  would  go  to  war.

Governor  but  to</span><span>  honour  an  intrepid  explorer  and</span><span>  navigator^</span></p> <p><span>  Flinders  wag  only  24  when,  in</span><span>  association  wich  Bass,  he  com-</span><span>  pleted  a  series  of  explorations  that</span><span>  ended  in  the  circumnavigation  ot</span><span>  Tasmania  in  1798.  Then  to  meet</span><span>  the  demand  for  new  outposts  Gov-</span><span>  ernor  Hunter  sent  Flinders  north</span><span>  to  investigate  the  possibilities  of</span><span>  there  being  a  t  port  in  the  vicinity</span><span>  of  the  Glasshouse  Mountains,  near</span><span>  Brisbane,  or  on  Hervey  Bay,  both</span><span>  of  which  had  been  discovered  by</span><span>  Cook.  For  some  reason  Flinders</span><span>  was  tied  to  a  time  limit  of  six</span></p> <p><span>  weeks.</span></p> <p><span>  Flinders  sailed  on  the  Norfolk</span><span>  from  Port  Jackson  on  July  8,  1799.</span><span>  and  from  the  14th  to  the  31st  of</span><span>  that  month  was  in  Moreton  Bay</span><span>  though  his  explorations  were  ham-</span><span>  pered  by  the  need  to  patch  np  that</span><span>  leaky  craft.  He  had  also  to  keep</span><span>  h  IB  ship  off  the  many  ehoals  with</span><span>  which  Moreton  Bay  is  bestrewn,  so</span><span>  had  little  time-in.which  to  under-</span><span>  take  a  closer  in-shore  examination</span></p> <p><span>  necessary  to  locate  the  mouth  of</span><span>  the  Brisbane  River,  the  existence</span><span>  of  which  was  unknown.  He  sailed</span><span>  from  Moreton  Bay  on  July  .31,</span><span>  rounded  Breaksea  Spit  and  sailed</span><span>  south-west  across  Hervey  Bay  un-</span><span>  til  he  saw  and  named  Sloping</span><span>  Hummock,  which  Hes  AJ5  miles</span><span>  north-east  of  -  Bundaberg.  But  bis</span><span>  allotted  time  was  running  low,'so</span><span>  Flinders  returned  to  Port  -  Jackson</span></p> <p><span>  I  which  he  reached  in  August  20.  lt</span></p> <p><span>  is  extraordinary  that  Hanter,  who</span><span>  was  a  sailor,  should  have  commis*'</span><span>  sioned  Flinders  ta  sail  upwards  of</span><span>  1500  miles  and  examine  two  con-</span><span>  siderable  bays  all  in  a  space  of  six</span></p> <p><span>  weeks.</span></p> <p><span>  Flinders  left  Port  Jackson  for</span><span>  London  on  March  6,  1800,  and  such</span><span>  was  the  official  'respect  for  bis*</span><span>  work  that  on  January  25,  1801,  be</span><span>  was  promoted  to  the  rank  of  com'</span><span>  mander,  and  placed  in  command  of</span><span>  the  334-ton  sloop  Investigator.

In  a</span><span>  shattered  world,  where  embittered</span><span>  people  are  reaping  a  heavy  harvest</span><span>  of  disillusionment  this  ig  an  en-</span><span>  couraging  sign.  But  it  is  not  a</span><span>  new  sign,  for  man  throughout  the</span><span>  ages  has  ever  turned  in  times  of</span><span>  adversity  and  confusion  tn  the</span><span>  higher  teachings,  has  drawn  com-</span><span>  fort  from  his  inner  thoughts  and</span><span>  encouragement  from  his  reserves</span><span>  of  moral  strength.  This  inherent</span><span>  strength  has  been  reinforced,  as</span><span>  it  has  ever  been,  hy  the  Holy</span><span>  Bible  that  was  never  new,  and,  so</span><span>  long  as  roan  remains  free,  can</span><span>  never  grow  old  ;  the  book  that</span><span>  has  been  written  on  the  hearts  of</span><span>  countless  millions  of  men'  of  more</span><span>  than  1000  languages  all  over  the</span><span>  world,  and  has  been  approved  by</span><span>  their  conscience.</span></p> <p><span>  The  British  and  Foreign  Bible</span></p> <p><span>  Society  reports  that  it  and  allied  ,</span></p> <p><span>  British  Bible  societies  have  trans-</span></p> <p><span>  lated  the  Scriptures  .into  761</span><span>  languages,  of  which  131  have  been</span><span>  so  translated  since  1330.  Fore'gn</span><span>  Bible  societies  have  added  an-</span><span>  other  301  to  the  list,  and  as  there</span><span>  are  about  3000  lan&lt;rua&lt;jes  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  world  this  leaves  1939  torrrues  to</span><span>  which  the  Biblical  truths  are  as  a</span><span>  closed  book.  As  to  numbers  the</span><span>  figures  are  much  more  imposing,</span><span>  as  the  English  language  carries</span><span>  the  word  to  many  millions  of</span><span>  homes  of  other  tongues.  Near</span><span>  home,  the  Bible  has  been  trans-</span><span>  lated  into  five  Australian  aborisri</span><span>  nal  dialects  -.  Dieri,  Narrinyeri,</span><span>  Tranda,  Woorora  and  Gunwinjrra.</span><span>  During  the  war,  the  Australian</span><span>  branch  of  the  parent  body  issued</span><span>  the  Scriptures  in  S  nari  dialect</span><span>  to  the  ""Fuzzy  Wuzzics,""  in</span><span>  Kennel  to  Solomon  Islanders,  in</span><span>  that  of  Blanche  Bay  to  natives  of</span><span>  New  Britain,  in  Amfcryn  and</span><span>  Paamese  to  New  Hebrideans  :  and</span><span>  in  Malay  to  natives  of  Dutch  New</span><span>  Guinea.  On  top  of  this,  since  the</span><span>  beginning  of  the  war  it  distribu-</span><span>  ted  or  helped  to  distribute  free</span><span>  3.000,000  New  Testament»  con-</span><span>  taining  the  message  of  H.M.  thc</span><span>  King,  of  which  3500  were  distribu-</span><span>  ted  to  troops  in  Australia  and</span><span>  the  balance  to  troops  in  the  south</span><span>  West  and  West  Pacific  area.  Dis-</span></p> <p><span>  tributed  in  this  manner  'the  truth</span></p> <p><span>  for  which  men  fought  was  its  t</span><span>  own  defence.</span></p> <p><span>  The  6tory  of  the  Bible  goes</span><span>  back  to  thc  dawn  of  man's  ability</span><span>  to  pass  on  expressed  thought.  Be-</span><span>  fore  men  learned  to  write  they</span><span>  told  tales  which  were  passed  down</span></p> <p><span>  from  one  generation  to  another.  ]</span></p> <p><span>  So  it  waa  that  for  very  many</span><span>  years  the  only  storehouse  of  all</span><span>  the  early  parts  of  the  Bible  was</span><span>  the  memory  of  the  Hebrew  race</span><span>  which  carefully  handed  down,</span><span>  from  father  to  son,  every  frag-</span><span>  ment  nf  its  past.  Then  as  man</span><span>  (earned  to  write  there  came  into</span><span>  bein?  a  mass  of  documents</span><span>  deal  i  np  with  the  law,  the  tradi-</span><span>  tions  and  the  history  of  >  the</span><span>  Hebrew  people.  As  all  could  not</span><span>  read  others  did  so  in  public  planes</span><span>  and  in  temples,  where  the  form</span><span>  of  delivery  became  a  chant  or</span><span>  song,  many  of  which  are  preserved</span><span>  in  the  Psalms  of  todav.  Then  I</span><span>  there  arose  prophets  whose  mis-</span><span>  sion  it  was  to  interpret  the</span><span>  ancient  teachings  and  so  call  men</span><span>  back  to  God,  and  their  messages</span><span>  were  written  and  preserved.  Of</span></p> <p><span>  such  material  and  in  such  manner</span><span>  the  Old  Testament,  wh'ch  is  the</span><span>  cradle  of  our  laws  and  charter  of</span><span>  our  liberties,  came  to  be  comniled</span><span>  and  written.  It  is  the  codifica-</span><span>  tion  of  the  wisdom  of  men  from</span><span>  the  days  of  his  earliest  recollec-</span><span>  tion,  it  enshrines  truths  that  are</span><span>  as  fundamental  now  to  man's</span><span>  wellbeing  and  happiness  as  they</span><span>  were  then.</span></p> <p><span>  The  New  Testament  deals  -with</span><span>  the  period  subsequent  to  the  be-</span><span>  ginning  of  the  Christian  Era,  and</span><span>  so  is  much  nearer  to  our  own  day</span><span>  and  its  story  is  enclosed  within</span><span>  more  definite  times  and  places.</span><span>  The  Old  Testament  began  with</span><span>  the  birth  of  a  world,  the  New</span><span>  Testament  began  with  the  birth</span><span>  of  a  Child.  The  Old  Testament</span><span>  is  a  treasure  house  containing</span><span>  the  garnered  truths  of  centuries,</span><span>  the  New  Testament  story  is</span></p> <p><span>  one  of  focussing  those  truths</span></p> <p><span>  _  xL.x  l-~_«~&lt;l-.</span></p> <p><span>  into  a  torch  that  became  Chris-</span><span>  tendom.

Hitherto</span><span>  the  high  costs  have  been  attributed</span><span>  to  shortage  of  labour  and  ma-</span><span>  terials,  and  there  was  a  more  or</span><span>  less  comfortable  feeling  that  it</span><span>  would  adjust  itself  in  due  course,</span><span>  when  these  commodities  became</span><span>  more  plentiful  and  the  acute  stage</span><span>  of  housing  had  been  planed  down.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  now  considerably  less</span><span>  assurance  on  the  matter,  and  hopes</span><span>  for  an  improvement  are  being  re-</span><span>  placed  by  an  uneasy  feeling  that</span><span>  building  costs  will  continue  to</span><span>  mount  until  they  become  prohibi-</span><span>  tive.  Anxiety  on  this  point  was</span><span>  recently  expressed  by  none  other</span><span>  than  the  Prime  Minister,  and  has</span><span>  since  been  re-echoed  by  no  less</span><span>  dependable  sources.  At  a  Queens-</span><span>  land  Country  Party  Conference</span><span>  last  week  Mr  Alpass  (Maranoa)  de-</span><span>  clared  that  the  excessive  costs  ol</span><span>  house  building  ""amounted  almost</span><span>  to  racketeering.""  He  was  sup-</span><span>  ported  by  Mr  Ian  Wood  (Mayoi</span><span>  of  Mackay),  who  condemned  the</span><span>  houses  being  built  in  that  city  by</span><span>  the  Housing  Commission  as  ""ugly</span><span>  in  appearance,  far  too  costly  -  a</span><span>  privately  built  house  nearby  cos!</span><span>  £300  less-and  unsuited  to  th«</span><span>  climate,  the  kitchens  and  dining</span><span>  rooms  being  poky  little  places  ir</span><span>  which  it  would  be  appalling  to  asl</span><span>  women  to  work  in  the  hoi</span></p> <p><span>  weather.""</span></p> <p><span>  So  much  for  Queensland's  at-</span><span>  tempts  to  meet  the  housing  short-</span><span>  age-  From  NSW  comes  similar</span><span>  complaints.

DECEMBER  30,  1946.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  YEAR</span></p> <p><span>  For  Eockhampton  the  year  about</span><span>  to  close  has  been  anything  but  one</span><span>  of  stalemate.  The  early  months</span></p> <p><span>  were  marked  by  the  return  of  large  !</span><span>  numbers  of  service  personnel,  then</span><span>  duty  done  and  ready  for  rehabilita-</span><span>  tion  to  civilian  Ufe.  Considering</span><span>  their  numbers  this  has  been  ac-</span></p> <p><span>  complished  with  a  minimum  of  up-</span><span>  set.  This  made  the  way  clear  for</span><span>  winding  up  the  various  patriotic</span><span>  organisations  that  had  performed</span><span>  such  splendid  service  during  the</span><span>  war,  though  it  did  not  quite  end</span><span>  the  community's  responsibility  to-</span><span>  wards  servicemen.  Various  service</span><span>  organisations  have  launched  ap-</span><span>  peals  for  special  purposes,  the  lar-</span><span>  gest  of  which  i""  the  project  to  raise</span><span>  £30,000  for  a  RSL  hostel.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  material  things  by  which</span><span>  a  city's  progress  is  measured  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  has  had  a  year  of  some</span><span>  achievement,  the  benefits  of  which</span><span>  will  be  felt  in  increasing  degree</span><span>  in  later  years.  High  on  the  list</span><span>  must  be  placed  the  inauguration</span><span>  of  the  Capricornia  Regional  Elec-</span><span>  tricity  Authority,  which  has  as-</span><span>  sumed  responsibility  for  the  supply</span><span>  of  light  and  power  over  a  wide  re-</span><span>  gion  radiating  from  Rockhampton,</span><span>  and  which  must  have  a  powerful</span><span>  influence  on  the  expansion  of  prim-</span><span>  ary  production  and  industrial  de-</span><span>  velopment  generally.</span></p> <p><span>  The  new  Fitzroy  Bridge  has  mad«</span><span>  substantial  progress.  Public  bodies</span><span>  have  addressed  themselves  stren-</span><span>  uously  to  the  improvement  of  ship-</span><span>  ping  and  road  communication.  Ship'</span><span>  ping  services  have  not  been  at  all</span><span>  satisfactory,  due  mainly  to  post-</span><span>  war  conditions,  and  an  improve</span><span>  ment  must  surely  be  looked  for</span><span>  though  that  does  not  remove  th(</span><span>  necessity  for  the  maintenance  of  *</span><span>  vigorous  port  policy,  Arterial  roat</span><span>  works  have  made  progress  and  il</span><span>  is  not  too  optimistic  to  visualis«</span><span>  within  measurable  time  a  bitumen</span><span>  surfaced  highway  linking  the  Cen</span><span>  tral  and  Southern  Divisions;  as  well</span><span>  as  substantial  improvement  in  thc</span><span>  unsatisfactory  connexion  with  th«</span><span>  north.  The«e  road  connexions  an</span><span>  all  important  to  the  development</span><span>  of  the  tourist  trade,  the  commer</span></p> <p><span>  rial  importance*  of  which  is  nov</span><span>  fully  recognised.</span></p> <p><span>  In  this  connexion,  however,  th«</span><span>  move  for  the  inclusion  of  the  sea</span><span>  side  resorts  into  a  Greater  Rock</span><span>  hampton  has  been  allowed  to  slid«</span><span>  into  abeyance.  A  reminder  of  th«</span><span>  importance  of  this  question  wai</span><span>  recently  given  by  the  Queenslam</span><span>  Tourist  Officer  in  Melbourne,  whi</span><span>  remarked  that  if  Central  Queens</span><span>  land  hoped  to  attract  winter  tour</span><span>  isis  from  the  Southern  States  ou</span><span>  resorts  would  have  to  provide  then</span><span>  with  such  elementary  amenities  a</span><span>  electricity,  water  and  sewerage.  I</span><span>  is  on  the  accomplishment  of  thes</span><span>  things  as  speedily  as  possible  tha</span><span>  the  case  for  the  inclusion  of  th</span><span>  resorts  in  Greater  Bockhampto:</span><span>  mainly  rests,</span></p> <p><span>  Australia's  acute  coal  shortag</span><span>  during  the  year  directed  attention</span><span>  to  the  huge  deposits  in  Centra</span><span>  Queensland,  especially  at  Blai</span><span>  Athol,  where  open  cut  mining  i</span><span>  practicable.  Strong  representation</span><span>  were  made,  to  both  Federal  am</span><span>  State  Governments,  that  in  any  pla</span><span>  for  the  development  of  Centn</span><span>  coalfields  the  existing  port  an</span><span>  railway  facilities  should  be  ei</span><span>  panded  to  meet  requirements  an</span><span>  there  is  every  reason  to  believ</span><span>  that  this  common  sense  course  wi</span><span>  be  followed.  During  the  year  ther</span><span>  has  been  a  considerable  increase  i</span></p> <p><span>  coal  output  and  the  prospects  ar</span><span>  that  the  industry  will  become  on</span><span>  of  the  most  important  in  the  div</span><span>  sion.  The  Fitzroy  Irrigation  Leagu</span><span>  has  been  active  in  pressing  for</span></p> <p><span>  thorough  examination  of  the  wat«</span><span>  resources  of  the  district  and  the!</span><span>  utilisation  and  investigations  hat</span><span>  been  promised  which  may  have  fa</span><span>  reaching  results.</span></p> <p><span>  Bural  industries  had  their  pro</span><span>  perity  interrupted  by  the  drougl</span><span>  which  became  menacing  in  ti</span><span>  early  part  of  the  year,  but  this  lu</span><span>  been  mitigated  considerably  by</span></p> <p><span>  series  of  storms  which  entourai</span><span>  the  hope  for  a  wet  season  in  tl</span><span>  New  Year.

"<p><span>  KOCKHAMPTOX,</span></p> <p><span>  SATUBDAY,  OCTOBER  26,  1946.</span></p> <p><span>  ABOUT  AUTHORS</span></p> <p><span>  Why  do  dentists  live  longer  than</span><span>  authors?  Not  that  it  matters,  of</span><span>  course,  ""but""  as  Rosa  Dartle</span><span>  might  have  said  ""I'd  like  to  know.""</span><span>  Weymouth  discovered  this  queer</span><span>  truth  when  rooting  out  material</span><span>  for  an  article  on  longevity,  and</span><span>  he  expanded  the  idea  that  maybe</span><span>  dentists,  being  so  to  speak  in  the</span><span>  business,  know  better  how  to  look</span><span>  after  their  diet.  Authors  know</span><span>  nothing,  apparently,  of  the  bene</span><span>  ""ficial  effects  of  eating  raw  carrots</span><span>  or  apples  or  rye  bread,  and  are</span><span>  addicted  to  counter  lunches-when</span><span>  there  were  any-to  the  balanced</span><span>  ration  to  be  browsed  at  pie  stalls</span><span>  and  hamburger  shops,  and  to</span><span>  having  more  coupons  tuan  clothes.</span></p> <p><span>  He  extended  his  researches  to  find</span></p> <p><span>  why  people  become  authors  in  the  j</span><span>  first  place,  but  got  no  nearer  than</span><span>  Hawthorne,  who  did  not  want  to</span><span>  be  a  doctor,  and  live  by  men's</span><span>  diseases;  nor  a  minister  to  live</span><span>  by  their  sins;  nor  a  lawyer  to  live</span><span>  by  their  quarrels;  so  there</span><span>  remained  nothing  but  for  him  to</span><span>  become  an  author,'  presumably  to</span><span>  live  by  their  credulity.  The  Amer-</span><span>  ican  people  appear  to  have  endorsed</span></p> <p><span>  his  decision.</span></p> <p><span>  That  brings  us  to  the  matter  of</span><span>  author's  earnings,  about  which</span><span>  there  is  such  knife-edge  speculation</span><span>  -probably  inspired  by  creditors</span></p> <p><span>  anxious  to  delude  themselves  in  the</span><span>  hope  that  the  rich,  gravy  of  a  best</span><span>  seller  will  trickle  along  to  moisten</span><span>  their  arid  lot.  Times  being  what</span><span>  they  are,  with  the  perceptions  of</span><span>  the  Taxation  Commissioner  quick-</span><span>  ened  to  every  hint  of  buried  treas-</span><span>  ure,  the  tendency  of  authors  to  lie</span><span>  over  their  earnings  ls  more  subdued</span></p> <p><span>  than  it  was.  Rather  is  the  trend</span><span>  towards  understatement,  so  that</span><span>  the  author  who  reported  having</span><span>  had  published  15  novels  in  16</span><span>  rears,  for  which  he  netted  £3095</span><span>  or  an  average  of  £206  per  novel,</span><span>  may  have  been  like  the  bird  which</span><span>  drags  a  broken  wing  to  entice  an</span><span>  intruder  away  from  its  nest.  If</span><span>  that  be  so  'twere  a  foolish  thought,</span></p> <p><span>  as  he  would  be  a  callow  tax</span></p> <p><span>  inspector  who  failed  to  follow  the</span><span>  train  of  the  15  novels  to  the</span><span>  6ecret  hoard.  On  the  other  hand,</span><span>  another  author  who  wrote  ""Lancer</span><span>  Spy""  in  four  months  received</span><span>  £2115  royalties  on  the  first  year's</span><span>  sales;  but  of  course  she  was  a</span><span>  woman.  Still  on  the  other  hand,</span><span>  did  not  Sheridan  use  sheaves  of</span><span>  hank  notes  to  take  the  rattle  out</span><span>  of  his  windows?  -  but  of  course</span></p> <p><span>  he  was  a  dramatist,  and  not  an</span></p> <p><span>  author.</span></p> <p><span>  There  seems  little  these  days</span><span>  to  encourage  anyone  to  become  an</span><span>  author,  and  even  less  by  which  to</span><span>  distinguish  him  when  he  attains</span><span>  that  dizzy  altitude.  If  the  author</span><span>  ia  better  dressed  than  hitherto  it</span><span>  is  probably  due  to  desperate</span><span>  relatives  packing  off  to  UNNBA</span><span>  his  clothes  of  pre-authorship  days,</span></p> <p><span>  so  that  he  must  either  dress  better</span><span>  or  turn  in.  But  even  when  better</span><span>  dressed  the  author  still  looks  like</span></p> <p><span>  an  ordinary  citizen,  being  denied</span><span>  the  blaze  of  glory  in  which  his  ilk</span><span>  of  Victorian  days  disported  them-</span><span>  selves.  For  instance,  when  fame</span><span>  tapped  at  his  door  through  the</span><span>  appearance  of  his  ""Vivian  Grey,""</span><span>  Disraeli  adopted  an  outdoor  cos-</span><span>  tume  built  up  on  a  dark  blue  coat,</span><span>  light-blue  knee-breeches  and  black</span><span>  stockings  with  broad  red  stripes.</span><span>  With  his  feet  on  the  lower  rungs</span><span>  of  the  ladder  of  fame  Dickens</span><span>  ventured  abroad  in  a  bright  green</span><span>  vest  under  a  sky-blue  coat,  while</span></p> <p><span>  Stevenson  startled  habitues  of</span></p> <p><span>  Sackville  Club  by  appearing  in  a</span><span>  black  flannel  shirt,  tight  dark</span><span>  trousers,  wellington  boots,  a  pea</span><span>  jacket  topped  with  a  white  som-</span><span>  brero  and  a  lady's  sealskin  cape.</span><span>  Nothing  that  clothes  rationing</span><span>  brought  to  light,  in  war's  grimmest</span><span>  days,  created  the  stir  in  East</span><span>  Street  that  would  flare  up  there</span><span>  did  an  author  permit  himself  to</span><span>  be  seen  on  that  thoroughfare  in</span><span>  any  of  these  flights  of  sartorial</span></p> <p><span>  adornment.</span></p> <p><span>  A  really  successful  Australian</span><span>  novelist  confided  to  us  that  his</span></p> <p><span>  first  autograph  party  at  a  bookshop</span><span>  was  a  grim  affair.  Having  for-</span><span>  gotten  his  well-disciplined  pen  he</span><span>  was  nervous,  the  bookshop  manager</span></p> <p><span>  was  brittle  because  the  books  had</span><span>  been  delivered  to  another  shop,  and</span><span>  the  sprightly  shop  assistants  re-</span><span>  garded  him-author  or  no  author</span><span>  as  a  fool.  The  first  customer  was</span><span>  an  elderly  gentleman  with  a  mind</span><span>  and  temper  of  his  own,  who  did</span><span>  not  care  a  dump  about  anybody's</span><span>  signature  in  a  book  of  which  he</span><span>  had  never  heard,  and  would  some</span><span>  sane  person  try  to  find  for  him</span><span>  a  copy  of  an  out-of-print  book</span><span>  on  heraldry?</span></p> <p><span>  They  do  things  differently  in</span><span>  America.  There  the  author  is</span><span>  enthroned  in  the  bookshop  outside</span><span>  of  which  is  a  glaring  placard:</span></p> <p><span>  ""Come  in  and  See  a  Live  Author.""</span></p> <p><span>  Common  folk  are  encouraged  to</span><span>  draw  nigh  the  great  man,  the</span><span>  Open  Sesame  thereto  being  a  copy</span><span>  ¡of  his  book  for  autograph.  This</span><span>  [is  the  prelude  to  teas,  lectures</span></p> <p><span>  and  autograph  parties,  luncheons</span><span>  in  department  stores,  appointments</span><span>  with  university  presidents  and</span><span>  press  conferences  in  every  town.</span><span>  One  such  pantomime  collided  in  a</span><span>  Bmall  place  with  another  travelling</span><span>  show  the  central  figure  of  which,</span><span>  through  use  of  plastic  surgery,  had</span><span>  made  a  miraculous  recovery  from</span><span>  unbelievable  injury.  There  being</span><span>  only  one  hall  the  two  shows  com-</span><span>  bined  forces,  and  during  a  storm</span><span>  of  oratory  the  two  great  men</span><span>  came  together  just  as  it  was</span><span>  claimed  on  behalf  of  the  salvaged</span><span>  one  that  he  would  be  even  better</span><span>  able  than  before  to  carry  out  his</span><span>  usual  pre-smash  work.  ""What  was</span><span>  jour  usual  workl""  asked  th«</span></p> <p><span>  author  politely,  behind  his  hand.</span><span>  ""Burglary,""  replied  the  other,</span><span>  modestly,  also  behind  his  hand.</span><span>  '""What's  yours?""  'Tm  an  author,</span></p> <p><span>  answered  the  literary  giant.  ""Hm.</span><span>  Same  thing,""  said  the  patched-up</span><span>  burglar.</span></p> <p><span>  Then  there  was  Quentin  Rey-</span><span>  nolds,  foreign  correspondent  and</span></p> <p><span>  author  of  ""The  Wounded  Don't</span></p> <p><span>  Cry,""  who  was  received  by  Presi-</span><span>  dent  Roosevelt  before  returning  to</span></p> <p><span>  London.  The  President  asked  to</span><span>  be  excused  when  the  'phone  rang.</span><span>  ""This'll  be  London,""  he  said,</span><span>  ""Don't  go.""  It  was  more  than</span></p> <p><span>  London-it  was  author  Winston</span></p> <p><span>  Churchill,  and  the  frugal  modesty</span><span>  of  the  two  great  men  was  a  lesson</span><span>  to  lesser  lights  when:  ""Well,  time's</span><span>  up  Winston.  I'll  have  to  hang</span><span>  up.""  But  that  was  indeed  riding</span><span>  the  rainbow,  for  more  authors  eat</span><span>  to  subsist  on  Mt  Parnassus  than</span><span>  have  the  run  of  the  fleshpots  at</span></p> <p><span>  White  House.</span></p> <p><span>  If  truth  there'be  in  the  proverb</span><span>  that  virtue  lies  in  doing  good</span><span>  by  stealth,  then  the  glow  of  secret</span><span>  satisfaction  must  often  warm  the</span><span>  heart  of  the  author  whose  works</span><span>  survive  his  name  if  alive,  and</span><span>  stir  his  dust  if  dead:  The  dust  of</span><span>  the  unknown  Hindu  author  of  the</span><span>  multiplication  table  has  mingled</span><span>  long  since  with  the  soil  of  India,</span><span>  whither  countless  child  students</span><span>  would  consign  his  work  which  they</span><span>  chant  more  ardently  than  they  do</span><span>  his  praises.  Some  authors  of</span><span>  song-hits  must  surely  court</span><span>  anonymity  in  the  sacred  name  of</span><span>  mental  stability,  as  for  instance</span><span>  the  genius  who  set  millions  of</span><span>  city-dwelling  Australians  to  im-</span><span>  plore,  mournfully  ""Don't  Fence</span><span>  Me  In,"";  and  his  colleague  who</span><span>  has  a  depressed  soul  wailing  that</span><span>  she  feels  ""gay  in  a  melancholy</span><span>  way.""  On  the  other  hand,  both  of</span><span>  them  are  mindful  no  doubt  of  the</span><span>  historic  truth  that  both  tailors  and</span><span>  writers  must  obey  the  edicts  of</span></p> <p><span>  fashion.</span></p> <p><span>  Still,  we  are  back  where  we</span><span>  started,  and  that  without  discover-</span><span>  ing  why  it  is  that  a  dentist  is</span><span>  granted  a  longer  stay  on  this  earth</span><span>  than  the  author.

They  were  ac-</span><span>  cumulated  by  servicemen  who  were</span><span>  .obyiötisly  overcharged,,  and  those</span><span>  charges  were  paid  by  them  out  of</span><span>  their  military  pay.  To  that  extent</span><span>  their  pay  was  reduced,  and  there</span><span>  can  be  no  question  about  who</span><span>  should  have  the  right  to  spend</span><span>  that  £4.56  million  surplus.  .  The</span><span>  most  obviously  wicked  plan  would</span><span>  be  for  politicians  to  retain  control</span><span>  of  its  disbursement,  and  only</span><span>  slightly  better  is  the  plan  that  a</span><span>  bureaucratic  trust  be  set  up  to</span><span>  pay  it  out.

These  two  at-</span><span>  tempts  were  defeated  by  custom,</span><span>  the  French  in  13  years  and  the</span><span>  Soviet  in  ll,  in'  each  case  long</span><span>  before  the  march  of  thc  heavenly</span><span>  bodies  got  to  work  on  them.</span></p> <p><span>  But  the  agriculturalist  required</span><span>  a  calendar  that  was  based  upon</span><span>  the  seasons  of  the  year,  and  al</span></p> <p><span>  though  poets  remained  loyal  to  the</span><span>  erratic  Cynthia  and  Meton-a</span></p> <p><span>  Greek  who  flourished  in  the  5th</span></p> <p><span>  century  B.C.-discovered  that  235</span><span>  lunations  are  almost  exactly  equal</span><span>  to  19  solar  years,  none  of  them</span><span>  helped  the  man  who  produced</span><span>  food  to  determine  when  to  sow  his</span><span>  seed  or  to  mate  his  herd.  The</span><span>  cycle  of  Meton  enables  us  nowa-</span><span>  days  to  foretell  to  thc  second  when</span></p> <p><span>  eclipses  will  occur,  it  is  helpful</span><span>  in  predicting  tides,  .and  may  yet</span><span>  come  into  its  own  in  revealing</span><span>  weather  cycles;  but  it  will  not</span><span>  warn  the  Torres  Straits  islander</span><span>  or  the  Trobriand  islander  when</span><span>  to  plant  yams.

The  court  at  Nuremberg  is</span><span>  not  an  English  court  based  upon</span><span>  and  administering  English  law.  'It</span><span>  is  an  International  Military  Tri?</span></p> <p><span>  bunal  which  had  its  beginning  in</span><span>  an  agreement  made  on  August  8,</span><span>  1Ô45,  between  Britain,  France,  the</span><span>  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States</span><span>  of  America  ""for  the  prosecution</span><span>  and  punishment  of  the  major  crim-</span><span>  inals  of  the  /European  Axis.""  It  is</span><span>  administering  a  law  that  was  made</span><span>  by  the  four  major  powers  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Allies  as  an  outcome  of  the  before</span></p> <p><span>  mentioned  agreement,  which  also</span><span>  defined  the  acta  that  constitute  thu</span><span>  war  crimes  under  the  jurisdiction</span><span>  of  the  Nuremberg  tribunal.  The</span><span>  body  which  established  the  tri-,</span><span>  bunal  .  at  the  same  time  eet  out</span><span>  the  rules  and  principles  which  it</span><span>  had  to  consider,  and  in  this  respect</span><span>  it  follows""  the  rule  of  Parliament</span><span>  by  which  English  courts  were  es-</span></p> <p><span>  tablished.</span></p> <p><span>  Bound  by  those  rules  in  deciding</span></p> <p><span>  cases  the  International  Milita  rv</span><span>  Tribunal  is  in  fact  a  legal  court  in</span><span>  the  same  sense  as  is  the  High</span><span>  Court  of  justice  in  England.  The</span></p> <p><span>  tribunal  must  decide  the  issues  ac-</span><span>  cording  to  the  rules  of  law  by</span><span>  which  it  is  bound,  and  not  by  .the</span><span>  discretion  of  its  judges.  Because  it</span><span>  is  obviously  impossible  to  have  a</span><span>  law  for  every  combination  of  fac-</span><span>  tors  that  can  present  themselves</span><span>  in  human  affairs,  it  is  possible  for</span><span>  a  culprit  tried  by  rule  of  law  to</span><span>  escape  punishment,  but  the  centur-</span><span>  ies  have  proved  this  to  add  to,</span><span>  rather  than  detract  from,  the  dig-</span><span>  nity  -  and  administration  of  law.</span><span>  .Tustice  may  demand  punishment</span><span>  that  the  law  does  not  prescribe,  in</span><span>  which  case  it  is  generally  better</span><span>  that  the  culprit  go  free  than  that</span><span>  the  court  be  allowed  discretion  to</span><span>  make  good  any  deficiency.  So,  the</span><span>  Nuremberg  tribunal  is  based  upon</span><span>  th*  rules  of  law  which  govern  it.</span></p> <p><span>  Rules  of  evidence  and  procedure</span><span>  are.  the  result  of  a  remarkably</span></p> <p><span>  successful  compromise  between  toe</span><span>  rules  of  Anglo-American  law  and</span><span>  those  governing  Continental  coarta.</span><span>  Counsel  for  the  prosecution  has</span><span>  practically  complete  control  of  ex-</span><span>  amination  of.  witnesses,  the  judges</span><span>  have  none  of  the  inquisitorial  pow-</span><span>  ers  usually  exercised  from  the</span><span>  bench  of  Continental  courts,  and</span></p> <p><span>  the  world  has  not  been  shocked</span><span>  at  scenes  such  as  those  which  char-</span><span>  acterised  the  trials  of  Laval  an*?</span><span>  Petain.</span></p> <p><span>  Because  it  ia  The  International</span><span>  Military  Tribunal  it  was  held  that</span><span>  its  memhers  should  be  regular  sold-</span><span>  iers,  and  it  was  suggested  that,</span><span>  to  add  to  their  authority,  they  be</span><span>  given  the  rank  of  major-general.  It</span><span>  is  difficult  to  see  what  it  was  hoed</span></p> <p><span>  to  gain  from  such  a  course  as  the</span><span>  persons  brought  before  the  tribunal</span><span>  are  answering  to  laws,  relating  to</span><span>  acts  of  war,  which  tue  court  was</span><span>  empowered  to  administer.

That  queer  assortment  which</span><span>  comprises  the  Probate,  Divorce  and</span><span>  Admiralty  Division  of  the  High</span><span>  Court  of  England  functions  no  less</span><span>  satisfactorily  because  its  laws  are</span><span>  administered  by  two  judges,  or</span><span>  ""trained  legal  experts,""  than  would</span><span>  be  the  case  were  i¿s  Bench  made</span><span>  up  of  a  lawyer,  an  ecclesiastic  and</span></p> <p><span>  a  seaman.  It  comes  back  to  th"".</span></p> <p><span>  elementary  fact  that  the  tribunal</span><span>  is  based  upon  law  that  was  estab-</span><span>  lished  to  punish-in  this  case</span><span>  crimes  committed  while  at  war.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  no  less  true  that,  for  the</span><span>  first  time  in  human  history,  man</span><span>  is  being  brought  to  book  for  such</span><span>  crimes,  than  it  is  that  the  trials</span><span>  are  themselves  on  trial.

JUKE  27,  1946.</span></p> <p><span>  POSTAL  REFORM</span></p> <p><span>  A  modest  request  comes  from</span><span>  a  modest  body  at  Sydney,  .-styled</span><span>  ""Hie  Postal  Reform  league""  fot</span><span>  ¡i  lom/  pull  r.nd  a  strong  pull  to</span><span>  try  to  dislodge  the  war  impost</span><span>  of  id.  .rn  all  posted  articles.  But</span><span>  modesty  is  apparently  no  har  to</span><span>  optimism,  for  we  have  not  beer</span><span>  able  to  throw  off  a  similar  impost</span><span>  of  World  War  I.  Australia  went</span><span>  ou  to  ld.  postage  within  the</span><span>  Commonwealth  in  IOU,  the'  war</span><span>  i  loading  of  M.  was  imposed  in</span></p> <p><span>  1018  und  was  taken  off  in  1920</span><span>  but  simultaneously  a  full  ld.  was</span><span>  added,  and  postage  stood  at  2d.</span><span>  per  I  oz  until  1941.  Nor  is  modesty</span><span>  as  observant  as  it  might  be,  for</span><span>  the  Postal  Reform  League  appears</span><span>  not  to  have  noted  that,  simultan-</span><span>  eously  with  the  Ad.  'impost  going</span><span>  on  posted  articles,  telephone</span><span>  rentals  went  up  from  5s.  to  15s.,</span><span>  local  telephone  calls  went  up  by</span><span>  id-  and  trunk  line  calls  over  25</span><span>  miles  also  went  up  on  the  upward</span><span>  eliding  scale.  Mr  Chifley-then</span><span>  Treasurer-told  the  House  on  Oc-</span></p> <p><span>  tober  29,  1941,  that  it  was  hoped</span><span>  from  these  measures  to  rake  in</span><span>  two  million  of  new  postal  revenue</span><span>  per  year,  and  subsequent  budgets</span><span>  proved  him  to  be  right  and  quite</span></p> <p><span>  a  bit  over.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  live  war  years  to  1944,</span><span>  the  P.M.G.  turned  in  an  aggregate</span><span>  profit  of  £25.78  million,  and  that</span><span>  on  1343-4  operations  was  the  high-</span><span>  est  ever  (£630  million)  though</span><span>  tile  1945-6  Budget  hopes  for  a</span><span>  profit  of  £7.05  million  for  1944-5</span><span>  and  one  of  £8.43  million  for  the</span><span>  year  just  closing.

At  least  60  per</span><span>  cent  of  the  increased  population</span><span>  went  into  the  six  capital  cities,</span><span>  and  much  of  the  remainder</span><span>  crammed  into  lesser  cities,  all  of</span><span>  which  made  for  easier  mass  dis-</span><span>  tribution..  Not  many  people  know</span></p> <p><span>  that  there  were  in  1944  105  fewer</span></p> <p><span>  official  post  ofiSces  in  Australia</span><span>  than  there  were  32  years  earlier,</span><span>  and  57  more  non-official,  receiving</span><span>  and  allowance  post  offices.  Then</span><span>  vast  8urns  have  been  spent  on</span><span>  roads  outside  of  City  areas,  and</span><span>  motor  transport  has  revolutionised</span><span>  ground  communications  carrying</span><span>  country  »mails.  The  scientist  bore</span><span>  a  hand,  too,  and  his  work  enables</span><span>  half  a  dozen  messages  to  scamper</span><span>  simultaneously  along  the  same</span><span>  wire,  for  P.M.G.  technologists</span><span>  trod-.closely-.upon  his  heels.

Actually,  it</span><span>  worked  the  other  way  round</span><span>  Comparing  1913  with  1939-both</span><span>  pre-war  years-the  Australian  in</span><span>  the  former  years  got  on  au  aver-</span><span>  age  147  *  letters,  post  cards,  news-</span><span>  papers  or  packets  and  parcels</span><span>  through  tile  post  for  which  he</span><span>  paid  on  an  average  10/10;  while</span><span>  his  successor  in  1839  got  156  of</span><span>  such  articles  for  which  he  paid</span><span>  74/2.  That  is  to  say,  the  1939</span><span>  man  got  nine  more  articles</span><span>  through  the  post  than  did  his  pre-</span><span>  decessor,  but  he  paid  63/4  more</span><span>  for  carrying  and  delivering  them.</span><span>  The  average  poundage  paid  on</span><span>  money  orders  dropped  from  15</span><span>  per  cent  in  1913  to  9/2  per  cent</span><span>  in  1942,  which  is  still  well  above</span><span>  the  hank  rate  of  exchange  be-</span><span>  tween  all  Australian  capitals  with</span><span>  the  exception  of  Perth.  On  the</span><span>  other  hand,  the  commission  on</span><span>  postal  notes  went  up  from  38/</span><span>  per  cent  in  1913  to  44/  per  cent</span><span>  in  1939,  and  considering  this  to  be</span><span>  the  small  man's  method  of  send-</span><span>  ing  money,  the  Governmental  pos-</span><span>  tal  monopoly  makes  him  pay  a</span><span>  tall  price  for  a  minimum  of  ser-</span><span>  vice.  But  maybe  the  richest  pick-</span><span>  ings  are  in  regard  to  cash  on-deliv-</span><span>  ery  parcels,  tile  commission  and</span><span>  postage  on  which  amounted  to  9.1</span><span>  per  cent  of  the'  value  of  the  par-</span><span>  cels  in  1913  and  9.8  per  cent  of  it</span></p> <p><span>  in  1939.  That  is  more  than  the</span></p> <p><span>  total  marketing  costs  (8.8  per</span><span>  cent)  of  all  Australian  primary</span><span>  production  in  1944,  and  is  long</span><span>  overdue  for  revision.</span></p> <p><span>  The  post  office  and  its  associated</span><span>  functions  have  become  a  popular</span><span>  institution  round  which  is  centred</span><span>  a  great  amount  of  public  faith.</span><span>  Through.  it  are  paid  or  received</span><span>  pensions  of  every  kind,  endow</span><span>  1  raents,  bonuses,  service  allotments,</span></p> <p><span>  war  service  homes  payments,  en-</span><span>  tertainment  tax  tickets,  tax</span><span>  stamps  of  all  kinds,  and  Common-</span><span>  wealth  Savings  Bank  functions;</span><span>  but  as  has  been  shown,  it  is  charg-</span><span>  ing  far  too  much  for  its  services,</span><span>  it  is  taking  from  the  community</span><span>  much  more  than  it  gives  in  ser-</span><span>  vice,  and  BO  has  become  an  unsus-</span><span>  pected  taxing  department.  It  has</span><span>  a  high  standard  of  efficiency  and</span><span>  integrity-the  revenue  handled  per</span><span>  employee  increased  from  £114  in</span><span>  1913  to  £202  or  more  than  double</span><span>  -but  it  is  being  used  by  politicians</span></p> <p><span>  to  collect  far  more  revenue  than  is</span><span>  required  in  the  performance  of  ita</span><span>  functions.  For  instance,  the  surplus</span><span>  after  paying  interest,  for  the  year</span><span>  ending  June  30,  1944,  was  22.89</span><span>  jier  cent  of  the  year's  income,  and</span><span>  th^re  was  a  depreciation  reserve  of</span></p> <p><span>  £7.15  million.  The  department</span><span>  should  charge  no  more  for  its  ser-</span><span>  vices  than  is  requisite  to  discharge</span><span>  of  all  its  working,  depreciation  and</span><span>  capital  liabilities.  Expansion</span><span>  should  be  financed  by  loan,  because</span><span>  reserve  funds  for  this  work  can  be</span><span>  raised  by  any  Government  which</span><span>  no  longer  has  the  confidence  of  the</span><span>  people.  The  postal  department  de-</span></p> <p><span>  serves  better  than  that  because</span></p> <p><span>  the  people  Bee  it  in  a  better  light</span><span>  Hum  that,  y*t  the  herein  facts  re-</span><span>  ven  1  that  it  is  being  used  now  for</span><span>  that  sinister  purpose.</span></p> ",Article,1946-06-27,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON THURSDAY.

Mr  Beas-</span><span>  ley  said  that  other  lands  should</span><span>  aim  at  high  levels  of  employment</span><span>  so  that  they  might  produce  goods</span><span>  with  which  to  pay  for  goods  ex-</span><span>  ported  to  them  from  Australia;  yet</span><span>  a  growing  list  of  people  in  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  have  to  be  subsidised  to</span><span>  pay  for  those  goods  and  services.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  a  first-class  unsatisfied</span></p> <p><span>  market  in  Australia  for  very  much</span><span>  more  Australian  production,  if  only</span><span>  the  idea  that  the  community  has</span><span>  rights,  that  are  »submerged  under  a</span><span>  rising  tide  of  industrial  restric-</span><span>  tions  and  imposts,  could  be  ap-</span><span>  preciated.</span></p> <p><span>  Other  than  the  uniform  railway</span><span>  gauge  proposals,  predominantly  a</span><span>  pick  and  shovel  job  of  great  fluid-</span><span>  ity  for  packing  weak  electorates,</span><span>  little  of  official  moment  has</span><span>  emerged  from  the  welter  of  post-</span><span>  war  planning  which  flooded  the</span><span>  Press  and  the  air  up  to  the  end  of</span><span>  the  war.  Although  it  is  of  prime</span><span>  importance  that  work  be  waiting</span><span>  for  men  as  they  are  demobilised,</span><span>  to  which  end  key  industrial  men</span><span>  should  have  been  got  out  in  order</span><span>  to  limber  up  civil  industry,  they</span><span>  are  tumbling  out  on  a  points  sys-</span><span>  tem  that  takes  cognisance  of  every</span><span>  other  factor  but-  the  place  of  men</span><span>  tn  industry.  That  lu  fact  was  dis-</span><span>  counted  by  Mr  Forde,  who  said  that</span><span>  unskilled  men  of  longer  service</span><span>  might  be  left  in  the  forces  after</span><span>  less  senior  but  skilled  men  were</span><span>  demobilised.  The  point  is  that  there</span><span>  would  be  a  much  better  chance  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  -unskilled  man  to  step  into  a</span><span>  job  than  is  likely  to  be  the  case</span><span>  under  the  points  system,  and  tc</span><span>  anyone  bnt  the  Minister  for  thc</span><span>  Army  that  might  appear  to  be  im-</span><span>  portant.</span></p> <p><span>  There  is  also  a  great  uncertainty</span><span>  about  what  ""the  Government  pro</span></p> <p><span>  peses  to  do,  and  the  extent  to'</span><span>  which  it  intends  to  cut  in  on  priv-</span><span>  ate  enterprise.  The  ""production  for</span><span>  use  and  not  for  profit""  slogan  is</span><span>  far  from  dead  in  the  Chifley  Cab-</span><span>  inet,  even  if  nobody  there  is  any</span><span>  nearer  to  understanding  what  it</span><span>  means  than  ever.  Nor  are  they</span><span>  prepared  to  admit-true  though  it</span><span>  be-that  it  is  the  profits  of  private</span><span>  enterprise  that  pay  the  losses  on</span><span>  State  -  managed  concerns.  »  Baw</span><span>  materials  are  also  in  short  and  er-</span></p> <p><span>  ratic  supply,  dollar  exchange  is  |</span><span>  flighty,  so  that  in  thousands  of</span><span>  cases  throughout  Australia  small</span><span>  prospective  employers  of  labour  are</span><span>  waiting  until  the  political  weather</span></p> <p><span>  clears.  Then  there  has  been  little</span></p> <p><span>  letup  in  taxation,  and  until  that</span><span>  comes  about  there  is  little  likeli-</span></p> <p><span>  hood  of  the  small  employer  feeling</span><span>  free  to  move  into  the  open  with-</span><span>  out  restraint.  There  are  still  far</span><span>  too  many  people  gunning  for  the</span><span>  man  who  essays  to  make  his  con-</span><span>  tribution  to  the  ""full  employment""</span><span>  objective.</span></p> <p><span>  There  ls  much  popular  miscon-</span><span>  ception  regarding  tile  main  em-</span><span>  ployment  producing  agencies.  The</span><span>  tendency  too  often  ls  to  be  misled</span><span>  by  the  noisy  and  Importúnate,  by</span><span>  something  working  under  the  wing</span><span>  of  the  State,  or  by  straightout</span><span>  State-managed  concerns.  For  in-</span><span>  stance,  most  people  will  regard  the</span><span>  State  Electricity  Commission  of</span><span>  Victoria,  which  developed  that</span><span>  State's  brown  coal  measures  at</span><span>  Yallourn,  as  one  of  Australia's</span><span>  outstanding  industrial  undertak-</span><span>  ings.  Yet  fewer  men  were  employed</span><span>  (even  during  the  war  years)  pro-</span><span>  ducing  electricity  and  turning  oui</span><span>  briquettes  at  this  great  institntioi</span><span>  than  were  employed  collectively  bj</span><span>  the  motor  garage  establishment»  al</span><span>  either  Melbourne  or  Sydney.  Thii</span><span>  despite  the  fact  that  those  estab</span><span>  lishments  had  their  personnel  re</span><span>  disced  by  Manpower  to  the  exte»</span><span>  of  about  60  per  cent,  and  more  em</span><span>  ployees  were  put  on  at  Yallourn</span><span>  to  meet  the  extra  factory  demam</span></p> <p><span>  --  -.-.-J  .</span></p> <p><span>  Again,  the  aggregate  railway  em-</span><span>  ployees  on  all  the  railways  of</span><span>  Australia  in  1939  numbered  104,779,</span><span>  yet  they  were  only  70  per  cent  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  total  motor  truck  drivers</span><span>  (150,000)  in  Australia  during  the</span><span>  same  year.  Before  war  broke  out</span><span>  there  were  in  Australia  about  10,</span><span>  OOO  garages  and  service  stations</span><span>  employing  approximately  40,000</span><span>  hands.  Most  of  these  establish-</span><span>  ments  were  of  course  in  the  cities,</span><span>  but  a  great  number  of  them  were</span><span>  in  country  centres,  diffusing  indus-</span><span>  try  in  a  manner  that  no  State</span><span>  owned  institution  has  diffused  it</span><span>  other  of  course  than  at  election</span><span>  time.  The  men  from  these  stations,</span><span>  together  with  their  knowledge  of</span><span>  motor  transport,  will  be  found  to</span></p> <p><span>  Lave  formed  a  tremendously  im-</span><span>  portant  part  in  the  mechanised  side</span></p> <p><span>  of  Australia's  armed  forces.  The</span><span>  same  men,  ripened  by  war  service,</span><span>  arc  ready  now  to  take  up  where</span><span>  they  laid  aside  the  service  they</span><span>  were  rendering  to  the  community,</span><span>  as  petrol  is  diverted  from  service</span><span>  use  to  civil  life.</span></p> <p><span>  This  is  merely  one  aspect  of  ser-</span><span>  vice  that  was  carried  on  before  the</span><span>  war  throughout  the  length  and</span><span>  breadth  of  Australia,  employing</span><span>  directly  a  large  number  of  folk</span><span>  and  indirectly  quite  as  many  more.</span><span>  They  throve  because  they  gave  ser-</span><span>  vice  that  the  community  wanted  at</span><span>  all  hours  on  every  day-in  other</span><span>  words,  ""full  employment""  based  on</span><span>  service.  Governments  have  got  out</span><span>  of  the  habit  of  considering  the</span><span>  needs  of  the  community.  These  and</span><span>  hundreds  of  other  small  job-givers</span><span>  meet  the  needs  of  the  community</span><span>  and  require  no  subsidy  as  their</span><span>  reward.  All  that  they  need  is  that</span><span>  bureaucracy  shall  stand  aside,  and</span></p> <p><span>  that  Governments  will  relax  re-</span><span>  strictions  on  material  and  ease  up</span><span>  the  war  imposts,  and  so  give  the</span><span>  all  clear  to  private  enterprise.</span></p> ",Article,1946-01-01,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON.

One  was  a  message</span><span>  from  Melbourne  recording  th«</span><span>  growth  of  Britain's  export  trade</span><span>  as  reflected  in  goods  reaching  Aus</span><span>  tralia,  and  the  other  a  depres-</span><span>  sing  tale  of  Australia's  lack  ol</span><span>  home-produced  consumer  good:</span><span>  through  inadequate  production.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  estimated  that  since  Feb-</span><span>  ruary  this  year  more  than  £15,000,</span><span>  OOO  worth  of  British  goods  have</span><span>  been  landed  in  Melbourne  compar-</span><span>  ed  with  the  total  figures  for  1928-9</span><span>  of  £40,000,000.  In  the  past,  three</span><span>  months  dozens  of  fast  freighters</span><span>  have  reached  Melbourne  filled  to</span><span>  capacity  with  first-quality  British</span><span>  merchandise.  Shipments  of  some</span><span>  lines  are  higher  than  before  the</span><span>  war-  This  can  have  been  achieved</span><span>  only  through  maximum  effort,  in</span><span>  the  drive  which  British  employers</span><span>  and  workers  have  launched,  as  a</span><span>  result  of  realisation  that  along  the</span><span>  road  of  greater  production  alone</span></p> <p><span>  lies  survival.</span></p> <p><span>  The  contrasting  news  item  is</span><span>  published  in  ""Building  and  Manu-</span><span>  facturing,""  a  Brisbane  trade  jour-</span><span>  nal,  in  which  it  is  stated  that  the</span><span>  growing  chaotic  conditions  noted</span><span>  on  all  sides  are  to  be  attributed  to</span><span>  one  thing-inadequacy  of  produc-</span><span>  tion  in  the  Commonwealth.

Discharged</span><span>  servicemen  complain  loudly  of  be-</span><span>  ing  unable  to  secure  civilian</span><span>  clothing.  As  to  onr  obligations  to</span><span>  distressed  Europeans,  perhaps  the'</span><span>  les  st  said  about  that  the  better,  in</span><span>  view  of  the  attitude  of  meatwork</span><span>  ere  and  wharf  labourers  towards</span><span>  the  shipment  of  foodstuffs,  which;</span></p> <p><span>  is  more  urgent  to  Europe  than  even</span><span>  clothing-  The  same  applies  to  keep-</span><span>  ing  up  lour  e»T>ort  trade  to  .meet</span><span>  interest  on  loans,  in  view  '  of  the</span><span>  millions  of  pounds  worth  of  over-</span><span>  seas  trade  that  has  been  lost  to</span><span>  Australia  by  the  Actions  of  coal</span><span>  miners,  seamen  and  wharf  workers.</span></p> <p><span>  Most  discouraging  of  all  from</span><span>  the  point  of  view  of  production  is</span><span>  the  prevailing  attitude  towards</span><span>  hours  of  labour.  '  In  Queensland's</span><span>  Labour  Day  processions  on  Monday</span><span>  the  claims  for  a  shorter  working</span><span>  week  were  prominently  displayed</span><span>  on  tanners  and  floats.  Yet  speaking</span><span>  at  Rockhampton's  celebration  the</span><span>  Acting  Prime  Minister  admitted</span><span>  that  he  had  just  come  fro.ro  a  meet-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  of  the  Federal  Cabinet  at;</span><span>  Canberra  where  the  picture  of  Aus-</span></p> <p><span>  tralia's  economic  situation  was  ex-:</span><span>  amined.  The  picture  showed  that</span><span>  Australia  needed  300,000  homes</span></p> <p><span>  and  there  was  also  a  serious  shor-</span><span>  tage  of  household  equipment  and</span><span>  buildin?  materials.  Never  l>efore  in</span><span>  Australia's  history  was  there</span><span>  greater  need  for  increased  produc-</span><span>  tion  within  the  next  12  months.</span><span>  There  must  be  a  united  drive  to</span><span>  make  good  the  shortage  of  house-</span><span>  hold  equipment,  building  materials</span><span>  and  all  the  things  that  the  aver-</span><span>  age  man  and  woman  in  the  com-</span><span>  munity  needed  for  their  comfort</span><span>  and  happiness.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Latour  movement,  Mr  Forde</span><span>  added,  stood  for  continued  improve-</span><span>  ment  in  the  standard  of  living,  and</span><span>  if  the  standard  of  living  of  every-</span><span>  one  was  to  be  raised  the  way  to</span><span>  tring  it  about  was  by  increased</span><span>  production.  Neither  the  Acting</span><span>  Prime  Minister  nor  any  of  the  La-</span><span>  bour  Day  speakers  had  the  courage</span><span>  boldly  to  declare  that  production</span><span>  would  not  be  increased  in  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  if  prpsent  trends  were  fol-</span><span>  lowed:  that  instead  of  the  banners</span><span>  ir.  the  Labour  Day  procession</span><span>  preaching  the  gospel  of  the  shorter</span><span>  working  week  they  would  have</span><span>  bren  more  profitably  employed  in</span><span>  setting  forth  Britain's  export  fig-</span><span>  ures  to  Australia  and  exhorting</span><span>  the  manufacturers  and  workers  of</span><span>  this  country  to  do  likewise.

Nevertheless</span><span>  public  interest  in  the  present  State</span><span>  Budget  was  doubtless  greatly  mini-</span><span>  mised  because  of  the  fact  that  the</span><span>  Commonwealth  Government  is  to</span><span>  continue  with  the  collection  of</span><span>  uniform  tax  and  the  State  Treas-</span><span>  urer  had  nothing  to  disclose  in  the</span><span>  I  way  of  higher  or  lower  taxes.</span></p> <p><span>  I  For  all  that,  Mr  Larcombe'a</span><span>  Budget  does  greatly  concern  the</span><span>  people  of  Queensland,  because  of</span><span>  the  unprecedented  number  of  mil-</span><span>  lions  to  be  disbursed.  The  estimated</span><span>  receipts  for  1946-7  are  £24,652,335,</span><span>  or  £122,071  less  than  the  actual</span><span>  revenue  for  thfe  year  1945-6.  A</span><span>  considerable  drop  is  expected  in</span><span>  railway  revenue,  the  estimated  de-</span><span>  crease  of  £1,257,339  being  attri-</span><span>  buted  in  advance  to  diminishing</span><span>  transport  of  the'  Commonwealth</span><span>  services  and  the  drought  conditions</span><span>  in  the  country.

PLANNERS</span></p> <p><span>  Few  words  have  achieved  the</span><span>  prominience  or  acquired  such  loose</span><span>  interpretation  as  those  '  of  ""plan</span><span>  ning""  and  ""planners""  since  the</span><span>  middle  war  years,  when  the  air  be</span><span>  became  heavy  with  blue  prints  of</span><span>  the  ""brave  ntew  world""  that  was</span><span>  being  charted.  As  we  have  come</span><span>  up  against  the  facts  of  the  situa</span><span>  tion  the  brave  new  world  recedes</span><span>  into  the  distance,  the  blue  print  is</span><span>  never  mentioned  and  there  is  a  ten</span><span>  dency  to  add  the  ""planner""  to  the</span><span>  limbo  of  things  forgotten  and  hopes</span><span>  unrealisedL</span></p> <p><span>  Yet  it  would  be  a  mistake  to</span><span>  do  that.  Never  was  there  a  time</span><span>  which  called  for  intelligent  planning</span><span>  of  the  future  way  of  life  in  all  its</span><span>  aspects.  But  the  planner  must  be</span><span>  competent,  trained  for  his  job,  and</span><span>  possessing  the  highest  educational</span><span>  qualifications.  This  fact  is  realised</span><span>  by  those  who  have  some  claim.  to</span><span>  the  title  of  planners.  To  win</span><span>  public  confidence  and  perform  its</span><span>  task  planning  must  achieve  the</span><span>  status  of  a  profession  and  to  do</span><span>  that  will  call  for  a  high  degree  of</span><span>  education  and  understanding  of</span><span>  many  things,  not  the  least  being</span><span>  the  human  element.</span></p> <p><span>  There.exists  a  Planning  Institute</span><span>  of  Australia,  whose  objects  include</span><span>  ""raising  the  professional  status  of</span><span>  planners  and  settink  -  up  a  high</span><span>  standard  of  education  for  entrance</span><span>  to  the  profession.""  The  past  presi</span><span>  dent  of  the  Institute  (Mr  H.  L.  E.</span><span>  Tranter)  in  his  retiring  address</span><span>  made  some  observations  on  plan</span><span>  ning,  and  those  who  are  connected</span><span>  with  it,  that  are  of  general  inter</span><span>  est.  What  is  understood  by  the</span><span>  world  planning  and  what  are  plan</span><span>  ners  ?  To  some  the  context  of  the</span><span>  words  has  been  pared  down  until</span><span>  it  means  little  more  tlan  ordinary</span><span>  foresight,  and  thereby  it  has  lost</span><span>  much  of  its  significance.  Others</span><span>  have  gone  to  the  opposite  extreme</span><span>  of  either  approving  or  violently</span><span>  condemning  planning  because,  to</span><span>  them,  it  means  a  complete  reconsti</span><span>  tution  of  things  as  at  present</span><span>  existing.</span></p> <p><span>  Planning,  says  Mr  Tranter,  is  the</span><span>  application  of  trained  and  technical</span><span>  foresight  and  intelligence  to  the</span><span>  development  of  human  environ</span><span>  ment.  Its  final  purposes  are  social;</span><span>  its  considerations  of  efficiency  and</span><span>  costs  are  economical;  and  the  pro</span><span>  cesses  by  which  its  findings  are</span><span>  shaped  and  given  the  authority  of</span><span>  the  community  and  then  adminis</span><span>  tered,  are  governmental  and  legal.</span><span>  In  its  special  dealings  with  man's</span><span>  environment  broad  physical  plan</span><span>  ning  is  most  closely  related  to</span><span>  architecture,  landscape  architecture,</span><span>  engineering  and  surveying.  Plan</span><span>  ning,  however,  differs  from  these</span><span>  allied  professions  in  one  way,  name</span><span>  ly  that  it  does  not  normally  com</span><span>  prise  the  detailed  specifications  or</span><span>  the  construction  of  the  physical</span><span>  elements  with  which  it  is  con</span><span>  cerned:'  Rather,  it  predicts  and  ep</span><span>  deavours'  to  direct  the  inevitable</span><span>  pliyseidgfowth  of  the  com'munity.</span><span>  so  that  -it  shall  take  pAce  'in  a</span><span>  reasoned  and  consistent  -way,  and</span><span>  not  in  a  self  coniradictory'.pd  -in</span><span>  efficient  way.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  not  possible  for  men  Lb</span><span>  master  in  detail  all  .the  subjects</span><span>  with  which  this  broad  planning  is</span><span>  enncerned,  but  the  professional</span><span>  planner  should  have  a  general</span><span>  knowledge  and  appreciation  of  the</span><span>  aims  and  functions  of  each  in  order</span><span>  to  express  and  record,  in  a  co</span><span>  ordinated  whole,  the  desires  and  de</span><span>  cisions  of  men  in  different  group*,</span><span>  concerned  'each  with  its  different</span><span>  special  problems.

J.  Maloney,  MLG,  former  Aus-</span><span>  tralian  Minister  to  Moscow,  indi-</span><span>  cates  that  the  matter  must  be</span><span>  exercising  the  minds  of  the  higher</span><span>  strata  of  the  Soviet  heirarchy.</span><span>  Russian  spokesmen  do  not  make</span></p> <p><span>  bitter  attacks  on  foreign  represen-  j</span></p> <p><span>  tatives  off  .their  own  bat,  and  it  can</span><span>  be  taken  for  granted  that  the  in-1</span><span>  spiration  in  this  case  comes  from</span><span>  headquarters.  It  may  be  due  to</span><span>  the  fact  that  the  Soviet  feels  it  is</span><span>  repelling  a  base  calumny,  or  on  the</span><span>  other  hand,  because  ""the  truth</span><span>  sometimes  hurts.""</span></p> <p><span>  Certainly  there  is  much  in  the</span><span>  recent  Australian  broadcasts  and</span><span>  Press  articles  of  Mr  Maloney  that</span><span>  must  be  disturbing  to  the  propa-</span><span>  gandists  of  this  system  that  they</span><span>  would  graft  on  to  the  rest  of  the</span><span>  world.  It  should  be  still  more  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  turbing  to  those  countries  which</span><span>  are  in  imminent  danger  of  under</span></p> <p><span>  going  the  grafting  process,  amongst'</span><span>  whom  can  be  numbered  Australia.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  ex-Minister's  account  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  role  which  trades  unionism  plays  I</span></p> <p><span>  in  Russia,  the  method  of  election  '</span><span>  to  the  Soviet,  the  taxation  and  loan</span><span>  raising  systems  are  all  strange  and</span><span>  ¿ven  mildly  shocking  to  ears  at-</span><span>  tuned  to  the  usual  propaganda  con-</span><span>  cerning  tiiis  modern  Utopia  of  the</span><span>  working  class.</span></p> <p><span>  According  to  Mr  Maloney,  in</span><span>  Russia  the  trades  unions  are  not</span><span>  the  champions  of  the  workers  but</span><span>  the  instrument  of  the  Government,</span><span>  and  their  constant  policy  is  to  force</span><span>  the  pace  so  that  it  fares  ill  with</span><span>  the  toiler  whose  output  falls  be-</span><span>  low  the  norm.  In  this  connexion,</span><span>  there  prevails  a  system  that  was</span><span>  especially  obnoxious,  even  in  the</span><span>  worst  period  of  the  capitalist  era</span><span>  i.e.,  when  the  rate  of  output  is</span><span>  raised  by  special  rewards  to  the</span><span>  pacemakers  it  becomes  the  norm</span><span>  for  the  future.  The  unanimity  that</span><span>  marks  Russian  elections  is  almost</span></p> <p><span>  laughable  when  the  system  permit-</span><span>  ting  only  one  candidate  for  each</span><span>  division  is  explained.  Kot  so  laugh-</span><span>  able-for  the  victim-is  the  taxa-</span><span>  tion  schedule,  which  in  cases  takes</span><span>  as  much  as  a  third  of  the  worker's</span><span>  earnings.</span></p> <p><span>  Tlie""  method  hy  which  Russian</span><span>  loans  an  filled  so  spontaneously  is</span><span>  simplicity  itself.  When  the  loan  is</span><span>  announced  there  is  an  immediate</span></p> <p><span>  calling  of  workers'  meetings  and  a</span><span>  i  resolution  is  proposed  that  each</span><span>  i  member  of  the  plant  subscribe  a</span></p> <p><span>  j  stated  amount  ttTbe  deducted  f  rom</span></p> <p><span>  bis  earnings.  These  resolutions  are</span><span>  always  carried  ""unanimously""-like</span><span>  some  of  .our  own  strike  motions</span><span>  for  no  one  with  any  regard  for  his</span><span>  own  well-being  would  dream  of  ex-</span><span>  pressing  a  contrary  view.  One  re-</span><span>  sult  is  that  the  Soviet  is  able  to</span><span>  announce  that  another  billion</span></p> <p><span>  rouble  loan  has  been  promptly  sub-</span><span>  scribed  by  the  Russian  people.  An-</span><span>  other  is  that  what  with  the  taxes</span><span>  and  the  loans  most  of  the  country's</span><span>  wealth  remains  in  the  hands  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  government.  j</span></p> <p><span>  ?This  is  Russia  as  the  Australian  j</span><span>  Minister  saw  it,  in  matters  affect-</span><span>  ing  not  the  hated  bourgeosie  but</span><span>  the  workers,  the  bottom  dogs.  It</span></p> <p><span>  is  something  for  the  Australian  j</span><span>  worker  to  ponder-and  embrace,  if</span></p> <p><span>  he  hankers  for  a  harsher  task-  :</span></p> <p><span>  master  than  the  Capitalist  ever]</span></p> <p><span>  knew  how  to  be,  experience  dis-</span><span>  crimination  of  the  worst  kind  in</span><span>  the  rewards  for  his  labour,  and</span><span>  have  a  considerable  part  of  his</span><span>  earnings  estreated  by  taxes  and</span><span>  loans  that  are  compulsory  in  all</span><span>  excepting  name.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr  Maloney  does  not  appear  to</span><span>  be  intimidated  by  the  London</span><span>  spokesman.  In  an  address  to  the</span><span>  Institute  of  Journalists  in  Sydney</span><span>  on  Friday  he  returned  to  the  at-</span><span>  tack  with  considerable  gusto  by</span><span>  declaring  that  Russia  was  more</span><span>  imperialistic  today  than  it  was  in</span><span>  the  days  of  the  Czars.  Its  drastic</span><span>  suppression  of  the  people  was</span><span>  more  complete.</span></p> <p><span>  His  concluding  words  should</span><span>  sink  deep  into  the  consciousness  of</span><span>  the  Australian  people  whilst  there</span><span>  ia  yet  time:  ""Russia  will  not  Help</span><span>  in  the  rehabilitation  of  any  coun-</span><span>  try.  The  longer  a  country  remains</span><span>  in  trouble  and  turmoil  the  better</span><span>  Russia  will  like  it.  When  a  crisis</span><span>  comes  in  Australia  there  will  not</span><span>  be  a  fifth  column  but  a  fifth  army</span><span>  to  contend  with.

It</span><span>  advised  that  a  war  memorial</span><span>  should  have  a  threefold  mission:</span></p> <p><span>  it  should  express  gratitude,  stimu-</span><span>  late  recollection,  and  provide  in-</span><span>  spiration  to  posterity.  It  would  be</span><span>  wrong  to  build  a  civic  project</span><span>  under  the  guise  of  a  war  memorial.</span><span>  There  should  be  no  question  of</span><span>  making  a  profit  out  of  an  act  or</span><span>  institution  of  remembrance.  A</span><span>  memorial  to  the  dead  shouldv  not</span><span>  become  a  shrine  to  utilitarianism.</span><span>  The  commission  recommended  many</span><span>  types  of  memorials,  including</span><span>  specifically  arches  and  bridges,</span><span>  chapels  and  stained  glass  windows,</span><span>  eternal  lights  and  fountains,  flag-</span><span>  poles  and  gateways,  monoliths  and</span><span>  parks,  statues  and  sculptures,</span></p> <p><span>  tablets  and  towers  as  suitable</span></p> <p><span>  repositories  for  institutions  that</span><span>  are  to  refresh  and  stimulate  the</span><span>  mind  of  man,  rather  than  cater  for</span><span>  his  creature  comfort  and  enter-</span><span>  tainment.</span></p> <p><span>  But  of  all  the  proposed  forms</span><span>  of  monuments,  none  was  more  con-</span><span>  ducive  to  higher  thought  or  intro-</span><span>  spection  than  the  proposal  of  the</span><span>  ""Save  the  Redwoods  League""  of</span><span>  California.  This  was  to  purchase</span></p> <p><span>  a  0000-acre  stand  of  the  world's</span><span>  oldest  trees,  which  is  to  he  named</span><span>  National  Tribute  Grove  and  will</span></p> <p><span>  become  a  monument  to  California's]</span><span>  service  men.  The  purchase  price</span><span>  of  this  grove  is  to  be  met  by</span><span>  public  contributions,  rather  than</span><span>  by  a  State  grant  which  would  have</span><span>  the  effect  of  merely  adding  to  the</span><span>  State  park  system  with  no  corre-</span><span>  sponding  attachment  to  the  mind</span><span>  of  the  people.  The  grove  stands</span><span>  five  miles  from  Crescent  City  and</span><span>  is  traversed  by  the  Redwood  ""High-</span><span>  way,  and  it  has  been  acclaimed</span><span>  one  of  the  most  majestic  sights</span><span>  it  is  possible  to  conceive.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  APRIL  lö,  1946.</span></p> <p><span>  COOPERATION.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  a  time-honoured  custom  at</span><span>  the  annual  meeting  of  the  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  Chamber  of  Commerce  to</span><span>  invite  a  survey  of  .the  future  of</span><span>  the  district  in  respect  of  its  mat-</span><span>  erial  development.  Usually  it  is</span><span>  made  an  occasion  to  expatiate</span><span>  upon  the  ""wonderful  potentialit-</span><span>  ies""  and  the  ""vast  untapped</span><span>  wealth""  of  the  division,  but  dis</span><span>  creetly  omits  serious  discussion  of</span></p> <p><span>  practical  measures  to  bring  these  &lt;</span><span>  things  into  use.  This  year,  how-</span><span>  ever,  a  new  note  was  to  be  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  cerned  when  there  was  a  disposi-  .</span><span>  tion  to  get  down  to  brass  tacks  ,</span><span>  in  examining  how  the  natural  re-</span></p> <p><span>  sources  of  Central  Queensland  i</span><span>  might  be  exploited  to  increase  &lt;</span><span>  production,  provide  employment  ,</span><span>  and  sustain  a  larger  population.  y</span></p> <p><span>  It  was  truly  remarked  that  &lt;</span><span>  these  things  would  not  be  brought  ;</span><span>  about  by  wishful  thinking.  The</span><span>  only  way  that  untapped  wealth</span></p> <p><span>  can  be  tapped  is  by  wise  planning,  ,</span><span>  hard  work  and  cooperation-espe-</span><span>  cially  cooperation.  Indeed  this</span></p> <p><span>  became  the  key-note  of  the  meet-  !</span><span>  ing,  as  well  it  might.  Never  ra  ;</span><span>  Australia's  history  was  there  less</span></p> <p><span>  cooperation  in  the  community  life  ¡</span><span>  of  the  nation  than  now,  and  never  &lt;</span><span>  was  there  a  time  when  greater  j</span><span>  need  existed  for  it.  It  is  something  .</span><span>  that  always  has  been  in  short  &lt;</span><span>  supply  in  Rockhampton.  It  only</span></p> <p><span>  needs  some  project  to  be  mooted  &lt;</span><span>  'or  two  sides  to  form  and  a  brisk  i</span><span>  tug-o-war  to  get  under  way.  It  is  ]</span><span>  probable  that  our  present  position  '</span><span>  regarding  port  development  owes  i</span><span>  more  to  the  faction  fights  .that  .</span><span>  were  waged  in  the  early  period  of  :</span><span>  oort  history  than  to  any  other</span></p> <p><span>  «ingle  cause.  It  affects  other  &lt;</span><span>  hinge  as  welL  Quite  recently,  oh</span></p> <p><span>  ""he  simple  question  of  beautifies-  ;</span></p> <p><span>  ion  of  the  city,  a  matter  upon  &lt;</span><span>  .'hich  it  might  be  expected  to  find  '</span><span>  omplete  unanimity,  the  move</span><span>  lent  was  with  difficulty  steered</span><span>  '?rough  the  initial  stages  into</span></p> <p><span>  'v»i  water«</span></p> <p><span>  Rockhampton^  has  suffered  more</span><span>  than  most  places  from  lack  of  co-</span><span>  operation  based  on  political</span><span>  grounds,  though  happily  that</span><span>  phase  has  to  a  large  extent  passed.</span><span>  Still,  it  is  always  liable  to</span></p> <p><span>  utcrop.</span></p> <p><span>  Only  last  week  a  public  meeting</span></p> <p><span>  .vas  convened  to  discuss  a  matter</span><span>  highly  important  to  the  future  de-</span><span>  velopment  of  Central  Queensland</span><span>  the  incorporation  of  the  seaside  re-</span><span>  ports  into  the  Greater  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  area.  Instead  of  the  question</span><span>  being  approached  calmly  «id  exam-</span><span>  ined  thoroughly  to  ascertain  where</span><span>  the  advantages  lay,  what  hard-</span><span>  ships  might  be  inflicted  »nd  how</span><span>  these  could  be  obviated,  the  discus-</span><span>  sion  kept  wide  of  the  point  and</span></p> <p><span>  often  bordered  on  the  acrimonious.</span></p> <p><span>  It  wag  only  by  the  exercise  of</span><span>  great  tact  that  the  Mayor,  who</span><span>  was  chairman,  salvaged  the  pro-</span><span>  ject  front  being  wrecked  without</span><span>  any  sober  deliberation  on  its</span><span>  merits.  Thus  something  that  is  of</span><span>  vital  importance  to  the  division</span><span>  and  which  may  determine  whether</span><span>  Central  Queensland  ever  is  to  be-</span><span>  come  a  worthwhile  tourist  and</span></p> <p><span>  holiday  centre  almost  fell,  victim</span><span>  to  a  rack  of  the  spirit  of  coopera-</span><span>  tion.  The  tendency  Is  to  be  regret-</span><span>  ted,  and  there  was  ground  for  the</span><span>  appeal  made  by  the  Mayor  and</span><span>  others  for  a  greater  manifesta-</span><span>  tion  of  cooperation  in  all  matters</span><span>  projected  for  the  common  weal.</span><span>  There  can  be  cooperation  and  still</span><span>  leave  plenty  of  room  for  honest</span><span>  difference  of  opinion  and  obser-</span><span>  vance  of  the  principle  of  majority</span><span>  rule.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  broad  question  of  Central</span><span>  Queensland's  future,  Chamber  of</span><span>  Commerce  sneakers  had  warrant</span><span>  for  looking  ahead  with  confidence.</span><span>  The  regional  electricity  scheme,</span><span>  the  new  bridge,  and  the  promised</span><span>  wool  disposal  centre  should  mark</span><span>  .  a  jumping-off  point  for  the  fur</span><span>  '  ther  growth  of  Rockhampton  and</span></p> <p><span>  other  towns  in  the  division,  as</span><span>  well  as  the  rural  areas.

"<p><span>  I</span></p> <p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  FEBRUARY  20.</span></p> <p><span>  1946.</span></p> <p><span>  LIFTING  CONTROLS</span></p> <p><span>  Tlie  removal  of  some  wartime</span></p> <p><span>  controls  is  having  a  curious  effect,</span><span>  and  one  which  may  be  causing</span><span>  something  more  than  mild  aston</span><span>  ment  in  those  bureaucratic  circles</span></p> <p><span>  which  felt  that  any  loosening  of</span><span>  controls  over  rationing  and  price</span><span>  fixation  would  be  the  signal  for  an</span><span>  orgy  of  wild  spending  and  conse-</span><span>  quent  rise  in  prices.  There  is</span><span>  gradually  accumulating  evidence</span><span>  that  the  opposite  result  may</span></p> <p><span>  accrue.</span></p> <p><span>  j  The  first  things  from  which  the</span><span>  'ceiling  price  has  been  removed  were</span><span>  certain  lines  of  vegetables.  It  is</span><span>  true  that  some  city  traders  with</span><span>  the  predatory  instincts  of  the  profi-</span><span>  teer  sought  to  improve  the  shining</span><span>  hour  by  boosting  prices,  but  the</span><span>  plan  crashed  rather  badly,  in  the</span><span>  case  of  tomatoes  especially,  and</span><span>  soon  they  were  selling  everything</span><span>  at  less  than  the  former  ceiling</span><span>  price.  The  same  thing  is  applying</span><span>  to  an  increasing  number  of  other</span><span>  lines.  Instead  of  the  ceiling  price</span><span>  being  the  minimum  the  law  of  sup-</span><span>  ply  and  demand  is  stabilising  the</span><span>  price  structure.</span></p> <p><span>  It  seems  that  the  lesson  has  not</span><span>  been  lost  upon  the  Government.</span><span>  When  it  was  suggested  the  other</span><span>  day  that  black  marketing  in  meat</span><span>  would  be  obviated  by  fixing  the</span><span>  price  of  stock  the  Prices  Control</span><span>  Department  showed  no  enthusiasm</span><span>  for  the  proposal,  fearing  that  in</span><span>  addition  to  the  difficulties  of</span><span>  supervising  the  plan  it  wonld  lead</span><span>  to  &  number  of  illicit-and  unhy-</span><span>  gienic-slaughter  houses  cropping</span><span>  up  and  there  will  be  tin  animons</span><span>  agreement  aa  to  the  undesirability</span><span>  of  the  last-named  contingency.  Ae</span><span>  a  fact,  the  meat  position  will  re-</span><span>  main  difficult  whilst  the  pre-</span></p> <p><span>  sent  abnormal  demand  from  over-</span><span>  seas  continues.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  restriction  whose  re-</span><span>  moval  has  been  promised  for  next</span><span>  month  will  probably  be  attended  by</span><span>  results  similar  to  those  which  fol-</span><span>  lowed  the  abolition  of  vegetable</span><span>  control.  When  the  Cabinet  meets</span><span>  in  March  all  Commonwealth  re-</span></p> <p><span>  strictions  on  the  production  of  beer</span><span>  are  expected  to  be  lifted,  though</span><span>  it  is  possible  that  shortages  of  cer-</span><span>  tain  ingredients  may  still  limit</span><span>  supplies  to  the  public  If  there</span><span>  was  one  thing  especially  in  which</span><span>  the  Government's  policy  of  curtail-</span><span>  ment  failed  .utterly  it  was  m  rela-</span><span>  tion  to'beer  supplies.  Instead  of</span><span>  reducing  consumption  and  increas-</span><span>  ing  the  war  effort  as  its  author</span><span>  (tie  late  John  Curtin)  fondly  imag-</span><span>  ined,  the  main  effect  was  to  change</span><span>  for  the  worse  Australia's  drinking</span><span>  habits.  Up  to  that  time  the  aver-</span><span>  age  citizen  was  content  with  his</span><span>  glass  or  two  of  beer  on  work  days</span><span>  and  holidays,  rarely  overstepping</span><span>  the  mark.  When  the  supply  was</span></p> <p><span>  restricted  and  the  inevitable  black</span></p> <p><span>  market  crept  in  he  developed  the</span><span>  habit  of  standing  at  the  bar  and</span><span>  drinking  as  much  as  he  could  be-</span><span>  fore  the  supply  became  exhausted.</span><span>  In  most  cases  this  drinking  was</span><span>  done  under  indescribable  condi-</span><span>  tions,  and  still  is.  Yet  it  is  a  safe</span><span>  prophecy  that  a,  month  after  re-</span><span>  strictions  on  production  and  alloca-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  are  removed  and  citizens  know</span></p> <p><span>  that  they  can  enter  a  ""hotel  during</span><span>  trading  hours'  and  have  their  re-</span><span>  quirements  met,  liquor  consumption</span><span>  will  go  down  to  a  surprising  de-</span><span>  gree.  If  reduced  consumption  is</span></p> <p><span>  what  the  Government  aims  at  it</span></p> <p><span>  will  secure  it  by  means  directly</span><span>  opposed  to  those  at  first  adopted.</span></p> <p><span>  The  same  thing  could  apply  to</span><span>  other  things.

The  late</span></p> <p><span>  idea  is  that  there  shall  l)e  fr</span></p> <p><span>  libraries:,  and  in  Queensland  pr</span><span>  vision  has  been  made  by  whi&lt;</span><span>  local  authorities  may  take  ovi</span><span>  Schools  of  Arts  on  condition  thi</span><span>  the  community  shall  get  free  rea</span><span>  ing.  Just  what  is  meant  by</span></p> <p><span>  free  library  is  not  always  mac</span><span>  clear,  though  the  prevalent  id&lt;</span><span>  apparently  is  that  a  library  &lt;</span><span>  gooct  bindings  makes  for  a  literal</span><span>  people.  Then  there  is  the  tram</span><span>  who,  in  winter  finds  the  libral</span><span>  building  an  excellent  shelter  froi</span><span>  the  blast,  and  it  is  on  record  th:</span><span>  one  actually  boiled  his  billy  au</span><span>  devoured  his  last  hand-out  witbi</span><span>  its  learned  precincts.  There  ai</span><span>  mothers,  too,  who  consider</span></p> <p><span>  library  an  ideal  place  in  which  t</span><span>  leave  their  children,  it  being  ""wari</span><span>  and  comfortable  and  they  can</span><span>  get  into  mischief.""</span></p> <p><span>  The  true  value  of  a  librar</span></p> <p><span>  depends  first  upon  the  desire  &lt;</span><span>  man  to  exploit  the  illimitahl</span><span>  resources  of  literature.  Withou</span></p> <p><span>  that  desire  the  building  might  a</span><span>  well  be  filled  with  waste  paper  a</span><span>  with  the  costliest  or  rarest  of  work:</span><span>  Built  up  as  it  Î6  on  the  tíreles</span><span>  work  of  legions  of  devoted  mei</span><span>  the  scope  of  books  is  so  immens</span><span>  and  breath-taking  that  to  compre</span><span>  hend  it  as  it  were  in  the  name  o</span><span>  the  building  Which  contains  th</span><span>  written  treasure  is  the  mos</span><span>  blatant  of  superficialities.  Yet  th</span><span>  movement  seems  not  to  have  go</span><span>  past  that  airy  generalisation,  an&lt;</span><span>  if  perpetrators  are  to  be  excuse«</span><span>  for  this  affront  to  the  dignity  o:</span><span>  learning,  it  must  be  on  the  gen</span><span>  orous  grounds  that  they  know  m</span></p> <p><span>  better.</span></p> <p><span>  Of  the  143,000  books  issued  U</span><span>  subscribers  by  the  Rockhampton</span><span>  School  of  Arts  last  year  all  bul</span><span>  five  per  cent  were  either  fictioi</span><span>  or  general  literature.  Even  so</span></p> <p><span>  the  total  books  issued  amounted</span></p> <p><span>  to  only  44  for  every  ten  oi</span><span>  the  population,  so  that  everj</span><span>  ten  persons  read  only  sl"">-htl\</span><span>  better  than  two  books  oh  tbf</span><span>  sciences,  history  and  biography</span><span>  travel,  poetry,  religion  or  philoso</span><span>  phyi  Obviously  the  literary  tastt</span><span>  is  mainly  diversionary,  and  whil&lt;</span><span>  lt  is  important  that  such  taste</span><span>  be  satisfied,  there  seems  to  he  nc</span><span>  more  reason  why  it  shouM  be  mel</span><span>  from  the  public  purse  than  that</span><span>  the  popular  taste  in  films  and</span><span>  radio  should  feed  from  the  same</span><span>  source.  In  that  sense,  free  enter-</span><span>  tainments  of  all  kinds  have  as</span></p> <p><span>  much  logical  claim  on  the  public</span><span>  purse  as  has  the  free  library.  The</span><span>  indubitable  right  of  the  citizen  tc</span><span>  expect  the  State  to  pay  for  at</span><span>  least  his  elementary  education  ii</span><span>  weakened  by  the  attempt  to  add</span><span>  free  entertainment  to  the  free</span><span>  list.</span></p> <p><span>  -  Yet  the  small  army  of  readers</span><span>  who  took  out  the  five  per  cent  of</span><span>  other  than  fiction  books  last  year</span><span>  represent  the  real  crux  of  a  free</span><span>  library.  They  read  to  expand  their</span><span>  knowledge  and  not  for  superficial</span><span>  entertainment  of  the  mind.  The</span></p> <p><span>  books  which  they  took  out  were</span><span>  at  least  part  of  the  highway  to  one</span><span>  or  other  of  the  exact  sciences,  to</span><span>  the  study  of  the  human  mind  and</span><span>  to  a  wider  knowledge  of  their  own</span><span>  and  other  lands.  It  may  have</span><span>  been  that  some  '  of  those  readers</span><span>  were  students  at  one  or  other  of</span><span>  the  secondary  schools,  to  which</span><span>  minor  extent  the  School  of  Arts</span></p> <p><span>  was  serving  the  purpose  of  a</span><span>  reference  library.</span></p> <p><span>  That  simple  fact  points  the  way</span><span>  to  one  of  the  few  justifiable  free</span><span>  libraries.  In  this  district  there  are</span><span>  eight  secondary  educational  insti-</span><span>  tutions;  the  two  Grammar  Schools,</span><span>  the  Christian  Brothers,  the  Range</span><span>  Convent  and  the  State  High  in</span><span>  Bockhampton;  and  St  Faith's,  St</span><span>  Ursula's  and  St  Brendan's  at  Yep*</span><span>  poon,  yet  no  serious  attempt  has</span><span>  ever  been  made  to  provide  the</span><span>  considerable  volume  of  scholars</span><span>  that  pas»  thrjbugQi  these  schoolb</span><span>  each  year  with  a  comprehensive,</span><span>  modern  reference  library.  The  need</span><span>  will  be  greater  if/or  wfeen  the</span><span>  more  ambitious  programme  of</span><span>  State  secondary  education  institu-</span><span>  tions  is  translated  from  the  realm</span></p> <p><span>  of  conjecture  or  promise  to  that</span><span>  of  accomplishment.  A  pre-war</span><span>  '  count  reveals  that  431  scholarship</span><span>  pupils  alone  entered  at  eight  nf</span><span>  I  the  secondary  schools  at  Rock</span><span>  I  hampton  and  Yeppoon,  and  presum-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  the  scholarship  pupils  to  have</span><span>  provided  two-thirds  of  all  pupils</span></p> <p><span>  attending  such  estatmsnments</span><span>  there  would  have  been  at  that  timi</span><span>  547  students  who  had  no  accesf</span><span>  to  a  free  public  reference  library</span></p> <p><span>  To  say  that  a  reference  library,</span><span>  kept  constantly  abreast  of  fast</span><span>  moving  discoveries  and  scientific</span><span>  developments,  is  an  elementar;</span><span>  need  in  a  place  having  the  legiti-</span><span>  mate  claim  to  being  a  scholastii</span><span>  centre  as  has  Rockhampton,  is  a</span><span>  mild  understatement  of  the  posi-</span><span>  tion.

"<p><span>  r  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON  |</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  JUNK  17,  1946.  !</span></p> <p><span>  THE  CARNIVAL</span></p> <p><span>  The  Rockhampton  Carnival  is</span><span>  something  that  has  been  with  us</span><span>  for  so  long  now  that  the  number</span></p> <p><span>  who  tau  remember  when  there  was</span></p> <p><span>  not  one  is  growing  strikingly  less,  j</span></p> <p><span>  lt  is  41  years  since  the  holding  of</span><span>  the  first  gathering  that  was  the</span><span>  precursor  to  the  present  establish-</span><span>  ed  round  of  fixtures.  Allowing</span><span>  for  the  vicissitudes  inseparable</span><span>  from  these  things  it  has  grown  to</span><span>  become  an  integral  part  of  the</span><span>  city's  sporting,  social  and  commer-</span><span>  cial  life  until  there  is  no  longer</span><span>  the  »lightest  question  of  its  per-</span><span>  manency.</span></p> <p><span>  Most  of  all  it  is  important  to</span><span>  our  commercial  life,  and  harking</span><span>  back  to  the  beginning  that  was</span><span>  thc  main  reason  for  its  inaugura-</span><span>  tion.  In  pre-Carnival  days,  and</span><span>  especially  in  the  years  following</span><span>  the  big  drought  at  the  turn  of  the</span><span>  century,  the  winter  months  in</span><span>  Rockhampton  were  dull  to  the</span><span>  poiut  of  stagnation  for  the  hotels,</span><span>  catering  trades  and  clothing  stores;</span><span>  it  was  said  of  the  period  that</span><span>  everyone  stayed  at  home  at  night</span><span>  and  wore  out  their  old  clothes  by</span><span>  day.</span></p> <p><span>  The  concern  of  the  business  com-</span></p> <p><span>  munity  was  to  get  something  start-</span><span>  ed  that  would  bring  visitors  to  the</span><span>  |  city  aud  stimulate  local  interest.</span><span>  The  tourist  trade  was  then  little</span><span>  thought  .  of  as  an  item  of  com-</span><span>  merce,  and  no  one  thought  of  sell-</span><span>  ing  our  winter  climate  to  the</span><span>  people  of  colder  regions.  So  the</span><span>  Carnival  had  to  be  an  attraction</span><span>  that  would  draw  people  together.</span><span>  The  initial  conception  was  a  High-</span><span>  land  gathering  with  concession  rail-</span><span>  way  fares  to  points  as  far  distant</span><span>  as  Warwick,  then  the  home  of  Scot</span><span>  tish  games  in  Queensland.  A</span><span>  cheaper  railway  fare  later-£1  re-</span><span>  turn  from  Brisbane  or  Longreach</span></p> <p><span>  did  the  trick,  and  the  affair  waa</span><span>  voted  a  great  success.  From  that</span><span>  Highland  gathering  grew  the  idea</span><span>  of  the  Jockey  Club,  Football  Union,</span></p> <p><span>  Show  Committee  and  lesser  bodies</span><span>  combining  to  make  a  week  of  it,</span><span>  and  when  the  theatrical  managers</span><span>  and  showmen  started)  to  come  along</span><span>  the  Carnival  was  an  established</span><span>  fact.</span></p> <p><span>  It  was  not  all  easy  going,  and  it</span></p> <p><span>  is  a  curious  circumstance  that  -the</span></p> <p><span>  very  element  whose  absence  is  so</span><span>  greatly  deplored  this  year  very  I</span><span>  nearly  wrecked  it  in  the  early</span><span>  years.  In  successive  yeara  it  in-</span><span>  variably  -rained  during  Carnival</span><span>  Week,  especially  on  the  Show  days,</span><span>  so  much  so  that  at  one  stage</span><span>  there  was  serious  discussion  about</span><span>  changing  the  date  to  September.</span><span>  With  only  the  natural  clay  under-</span><span>  foot  the  showground  was  a  stickv</span><span>  place  in  wet  weather  and  many  a</span><span>  visitor  declared  that  he  had  seen</span></p> <p><span>  his  first  and  last  t  Rockhampton</span><span>  Carnival.  But  if  they  did  not  come</span><span>  back  others  did  and  with  the</span><span>  weather  man  mending  his  ways  the</span><span>  j  Carnival  prospered,</span></p> <p><span>  j  There  nave  been  good  and  bad</span></p> <p><span>  Carnivals,  measured  by  the  degree</span><span>  I  of  prosperity  k  enjoyed  by  the  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  trict.  The  .  depression  years  saw</span></p> <p><span>  j  some  lean  Carnivals,  as  might  be</span><span>  expected,  but  the  institution  weath</span><span>  I  ered  the  storm.  It  was  not  alto</span></p> <p><span>  getner  proof  against  the  dark  tear</span><span>  years.  When  the  Japanese  were</span><span>  hammering  at  our  doors  the  Show</span><span>  was  suspended,  the  footballers  were</span><span>  away  playing  a  more  serious  game,</span><span>  and  the  late  John  Curtin's  restric-</span><span>  tions  reduced  racing  to  a  shadow</span><span>  of  its  former  self.  But  the  habit</span><span>  of  the  Carnival  was  so  deeply  in-</span><span>  grained  in  the  community  that</span><span>  when  June  came  round  the  BJC,  in</span><span>  the  face  of  some  criticism,  put  on</span><span>  a  modest  substitute  .

These  things  were  not</span><span>  won  without  cost  which  left  a</span><span>  legacy  of  bitterness  in  those  older</span><span>  countries  where  the  scenes  were</span><span>  enacted,  but  which'has  no  place  in</span><span>  this  land  that  has  known  only  the</span><span>  fruits  of  the  victories  gained.  None</span><span>  will  question  that  the  Old  World</span><span>  workers  who  won  the  charter  sym-</span><span>  bolised  by  May  Day  had  a  just</span><span>  cause,  nor  would  they  take  away</span><span>  the  benefits  which  have  come  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  working  classes  of  the  world  as</span></p> <p><span>  a  result  of  their  sacrifices.</span></p> <p><span>  Today  in  the  cities  and  towns  of</span><span>  Queensland  industrial  unions  and</span><span>  l-abour  political  organisations</span><span>  march  with  bands  playing  and  ban-</span><span>  ners  flying.  It  would  be  interesting</span></p> <p><span>  to  read  the  minds  of  the  march-</span></p> <p><span>  ers  and  learn  what  thoughts</span><span>  agitate  them.  This  is  the  first  Lab-</span><span>  our  Day  celebration  since  the  lift-</span><span>  ing  of  the  shadow  of  an  oppres-</span><span>  sion  more  menacing  to  the  workers</span><span>  of  tue  world  than  anything  the</span><span>  worst  period  of  the  industrial  era</span><span>  remotely  approached.  After  more</span><span>  than  a  year  there  is  still  being</span><span>  revealed  the  horrors  of  the  slave</span><span>  labour  camps  of  Europe;  the  re-</span><span>  curring  story  of  the  Burma  rail-</span><span>  way  built  with  the  dying,  efforts  oi</span><span>  our  own  Australian  men,  still</span><span>  arouses  feelings  of  the  deepest</span><span>  anger.  Would  It  not  be.  fitting  if</span><span>  this  first  peacetime  Labour  Day</span><span>  commemoration  were  given  over  to</span><span>  thanksgiving  that,  by  the  suffer-</span><span>  ing;  and  sacrifices  of  those  men.</span><span>  we  were  «aved  such  things  as  they</span><span>  suffered,  and  that  our  workers</span><span>  march  in  freedom  in  a  land'  of</span><span>  plenty,  enjoying  labour  conditions</span><span>  such  as  ho  other  country  on  earth</span></p> <p><span>  ha*  even  known?</span></p> <p><span>  But  it  will  not  be  so  unless  the</span><span>  spirit  of  Labour  Day  is  in  strik-</span><span>  ing  contrast  with  current  happen-</span><span>  ing,  in  the  industrial  sphere  espec-</span><span>  ially.  There  will  be  no  thanksgiv-</span><span>  ing  for  the  miraculous  escape</span><span>  which  Australia  has  bad,  but  there</span><span>  will  be  much  said  about  the  40</span><span>  hour  week  and  the  principle  of  pre-</span><span>  ference  to  unionists,  whether  or</span><span>  not.  they  act  in  a  way  that  entit-</span><span>  les  them  to  any  preference.</span></p> <p><span>  It  would  he  fitting,  on  this  Lab-</span><span>  our  ..Day,  to  recognise  thai  the</span></p> <p><span>  Australian  worker  is  faced  with  a</span></p> <p><span>  tyranny  mo|e  autocratie  ànd.futh</span><span>  lesfc  than  anything  a-ssoclated  *with</span><span>  thS^Mastcr  Class  in  the  bad*  «ld</span></p> <p><span>  dayát;  Day  by  day  he  is  coming</span><span>  more  and  more  under  the  domina-</span><span>  tion  of  union  bosses.  Let  it  be</span><span>  called  what  one  will-Socialism.</span><span>  Communism  or  Syndicalism-it  is</span><span>  moving  forward  a  dread  spectre,</span><span>  planning  chaos,  regimentation  and</span><span>  tyranny.  If  unionists  themselves</span><span>  could  only  sec  through  this  dark</span><span>  glass  clearly,  they  must  real'rse</span><span>  ,that  Syndicalism  will  màin  the</span><span>  end  of  liberty  for  them  along  with</span></p> <p><span>  their  employers.  The  '  time  ap-  ;</span><span>  preaches  when  the  whole  trade  .</span></p> <p><span>  union  movement  will  have  to  make</span></p> <p><span>  up  its  mind  what  it  wants-de-</span><span>  mocracy  or  autocracy.  It  must  not</span><span>  only  make  up  its,  mind,  but  it  must</span><span>  be  prepared  to  say  what  it  will</span></p> <p><span>  have.</span></p> <p><span>  The  industrial  strife  today  hap</span></p> <p><span>  nothing  to  do  with  the  struggle  j</span><span>  for  higher  wages,  better  conditions</span></p> <p><span>  or  resistance  to  victimisation,  tra-</span><span>  ditional  causes-  of.  dispute  between</span><span>  employer  and  employee.  Thousands</span><span>  of  men  are  thrown  out  of  work</span><span>  and  millions  of  pounds  in  wages</span><span>  irretrievably  lost  over  such  things</span><span>  as  the  time  allowed  for  washing</span><span>  hands;  or  a  simple  question  of  sen-</span><span>  iority'  at  a  factory  which  could</span></p> <p><span>  have  been  settled  ia  half  an  hour  j</span><span>  by  the  Industrial  Court.  It  is  for</span></p> <p><span>  these  things  that  hardship  and  mis-  1</span><span>  ery  prevail  at  a  time  when  there  '</span><span>  should  be  contentment  and  rejoic-</span></p> <p><span>  ing.  There  is  good  reason  to  keep  1</span><span>  the  May  Day  spirit  alive  in  the  1</span><span>  workers.  They  will  have  to  resort  &lt;</span><span>  to  it  sooner  or  later,  not  to  defeat'.  :</span><span>  the.

From  the</span><span>  struggle  for  better  conditions  iu</span><span>  the  I890's  we  have  swung  to  the</span><span>  tyranny  of  the  union  boss  and  mil-</span></p> <p><span>  itant  unionist  of  the  1940's.  Soon-  &lt;</span><span>  er  or  later  the  pendulum  will</span><span>  swing  back.  How  soon  or  how  late</span></p> <p><span>  none  can  foretell.  But  there  in</span></p> <p><span>  evitably  comes  a  turning  point  and</span><span>  not  infrequently  it  is  involved  in</span><span>  some  incident  far  removed  from</span><span>  the  actual  cause  of  dispute.  Who</span><span>  knows  but  that  the  football  inci-</span><span>  dent  at  Eockhampton,  OP  the  e\e</span><span>  of  Labour  Day,  1946,  will  be  thc</span><span>  spark  that  sets  in  motion  the  re</span><span>  vulsion  in  feeling  of  the  great</span><span>  majority  .of  workers  and  the  long</span><span>  suffering  community,  and  casts  off</span><span>  the  shackles.

Thirty</span><span>  one  years  ago  the  men  of</span><span>  Anzac,  in  association  with  the</span><span>  regulars  of  the  29th  English</span><span>  division  and  the  Naval  divi-</span><span>  sion  achieved  what  was  held</span><span>  to  be  the  impossible.  The</span><span>  audacity  of  the  attack  was</span><span>  also  a  measure  of  the  magni-</span><span>  ficent  fighting  qualities  of  the</span><span>  troops,  in  which  dash  and</span><span>  doggedness  of  the  Anzacs</span><span>  were  matched  against  the</span><span>  boldness  and  courage  of  the</span><span>  enemy.  Whatever  may  be</span><span>  the  judgement  of  history  on</span><span>  the  strategy  of  the  landing  on</span><span>  will  ever  be  acclaimed  a</span><span>  mighty  feat  of  arms.</span></p> <p><span>  More  pertinent  to  the  well-</span><span>  being  of  man  is  the  value  of</span><span>  Gallipoli,  or  even  of  the  1914</span><span>  18  war  to  humanity,  and  faint</span><span>  hearts  are  prone  to  measure</span><span>  this  by  standards  that  take</span><span>  no  account  of  the  imperish-</span><span>  able  things  for  Avhich  we</span><span>  fought  then  as  we  did  again.</span><span>  It  is  a  policy  of  despair  to</span><span>  declare  Anzac  to  have  been  in</span><span>  vain,  for  on  Gallipoli  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  asserted  her  determina-</span><span>  tion  to  preserve  her  way  of</span><span>  life,  and  matched  her  asser-</span><span>  tion  with  the  valour  of  her</span><span>  sons.  That  example  nerved</span><span>  her  to  even  greater  efforts</span><span>  when  the  challenge  was  re-</span><span>  newed,  for  the  capacity  of</span><span>  man  to  act  aggressively  is</span><span>  checked  only  by  the  will  and</span><span>  determination  of  peace</span><span>  loving  nations  to  resist.  Not</span><span>  only  must  we  defeat  the  ag-</span><span>  gressor,  but  we  must  win  him</span><span>  to  ways  of  peaceful  negotia-</span><span>  tion  and  the  rule  of  the  law.</span></p> <p><span>  To  this  end  we  must  pray</span><span>  that  the  lessons  of  Anzac  and</span><span>  those  which  we  have  imbibed</span><span>  will  add  forbearance  to  our</span><span>  councils  that  are  now  in  ses-</span><span>  sion,  and  will  endow  us  with</span><span>  that  wisdom  which  enables</span><span>  man  so  to  live  in  peace  that</span><span>  he  will  incur  neither  the</span><span>  enmity  nor  the  envy  of  his</span><span>  fellows.  .</span></p> <p><span>  STEADYUTG  UP  THE  INVESTOR</span></p> <p><span>  Every  occasionally  there  comes</span><span>  from  Canberra,  an  announcement</span><span>  that  gome  large  oversea  finn  is</span><span>  throbbing  with  eagerness  to  sink</span><span>  a  few  million  in  factory  premises</span><span>  and  plant  in  Australia;  and  no</span><span>  leas  frequently  there  comes  in-</span><span>  creasing  evidence  that  Australian</span><span>  factories  are  merely  scraping  along</span><span>  on  a  bare  allowance  of  fuel  and</span><span>  supplies,  while  the  Taxation  Com-</span><span>  missioner  stands  at  their  elbows</span><span>  to  repress  any  tendency  to  rising</span><span>  profits  or  encouragement.  The  re-</span><span>  currence  of  strikes,  too,  and  the</span><span>  failure  of  Canberra  to  sustain  the</span><span>  rule  of  law  are  all  conducive  to</span><span>  damp  down  any  tendency  to  com-</span><span>  mercial  and  industrial  exuberance,</span><span>  In  the  main,  such  secondary  in-</span><span>  dustries  as  are  prospecting  the</span><span>  ground  are  those  with  mass  pro-</span><span>  duction  technique  that  hope,  by</span><span>  working  inside  the  tariffs  walls,  to</span><span>  compete  with  industries  already</span><span>  here  for  the  Australian  market.</span></p> <p><span>  There  has  not  yet  been  any  seri-</span><span>  ous  suggestion  that  they  would</span><span>  produce  for  export,  any  more  than</span><span>  chere  ever  is  any  other  than  politi-</span><span>  cal  boastings  or  propaganda  to  the</span><span>  effect  that  secondary  industries  al-</span><span>  ready  here  will  be  able  so  Cb  pro-</span><span>  duce  for  export.</span></p> <p><span>  One  snag  upon  which  overseas</span><span>  investors  strike  is  that  of  double</span><span>  taxation,  an  Australian  resident</span><span>  being  liable  to  tax  on  income  from</span><span>  all  sources  whether  earned  in  or</span><span>  out  of  Australia.  The  only  excep-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  to  this  is  where  income  is</span><span>  taxed  in  the  country  where  it  is</span><span>  derived  but-and  this  is  important</span><span>  -there  is  no  such  exception  in  the</span><span>  case  of  company  dividends.  The</span><span>  effect  of  this  rule  is  that  a  com-</span><span>  pany  in  Great  Britain  or  USA</span></p> <p><span>  would  pay  6/-  in  every  £  of  in-</span></p> <p><span>  terest  earned,  and  would  pay  25</span><span>  per  cent  of  the  remainder  to  send</span><span>  it  home.  A  dividend  of  80/-  pei</span><span>  cent  would  thus  pay  24/-  tax  and</span><span>  14/-  exchange  or  38/-  in  all,  bring-</span><span>  ing  down  the  return  to  42/-  pei</span><span>  cent  and,  in  the  case  of  Britain,</span><span>  that  diminished  amount  would</span><span>  have  to  face  the  Taxation  Com'</span><span>  missioner.  That  is  well  below  thc</span><span>  return  that  can  be  obtained  io</span><span>  London  from  investing  in  eithei</span><span>  British  or  Australian  3  per  cení</span><span>  War  Loan,  with  complete  freedom</span><span>  from  worry  over  industrial</span><span>  troubles,  fluctuating  prices  anc</span><span>  trouble  over  getting  raw  mater</span><span>  ials.  Companies  thinking  of  set</span><span>  ting  up  in  Australia  now  may  bi</span><span>  hoping  for  the  eclipse  at  nexl</span><span>  election  of  the  Chifley  Government</span></p> <p><span>  and  its  band  of  hare-brained  econ</span><span>  omists.  There  can  be  little  otbei</span><span>  Lope  for  them.  *</span></p> <p><span>  Then  if  they  analyse  factory  pro</span><span>  duct  ion,  intending  investors  wil</span><span>  find  something  to  steady  up  au;</span><span>  optimism  they  may  have  left  af  te;</span><span>  considemig  the  buccaneering  tax</span><span>  ation.

Although  the  rated  hors</span><span>  power  increased  during  the""  perioi</span><span>  by  55.8  per  cent  the  factory  pro</span><span>  «ruction  increased  by  only  15.1  pe</span><span>  sent.

In  fact,  corrotted</span><span>  for  this  factor  the  output  per  em-</span><span>  ployee  fell  by  7.2  per  cent.

"<p><span>  I  Ehe  Aorninr  Eulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROGKHAMPTUA,</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  AUGUST  2,  1946.</span></p> <p><span>  MANUFACTURING  EXPANSION</span></p> <p><span>  Accor&lt;ng  to  a  statement  issued</span><span>  by  the  Commonwealth  Minister  for</span><span>  Post-war  Reconstruction  British  in</span><span>  terests  will  invest  £4,000,000  and</span><span>  the  United  States  £2,500,000  in</span><span>  new  industries  in  Australia.  Aus</span><span>  tralian  capital  also  to  be  spent  will</span><span>  bring  the  total  amount  to  £8,500,</span><span>  d00.  The  list  of  industries  involve</span><span>  a  wide  range,  including  electrical</span><span>  equipment,  motor  car  parts,  arti</span><span>  ficial  silk  and  wool  fabrics,  foot</span><span>  wear,  clothing,  engineering,  phar</span><span>  maceutical  and  other  products.</span><span>  Some  of  the  firms  will  occupy  war</span><span>  time  munition  plants  in  New</span><span>  Shiith  Wales,  Victoria,  Queensland</span><span>  and  South  Australia  to  employ</span><span>  about  6000  persons.

These  include  relatively</span><span>  attractive  costs  in  local  industry,</span><span>  the  general  high  level  of  Austral</span><span>  ian  industrial  development,  techra,</span><span>  cal  eftciencv  and  the  competence</span><span>  of  our  workmen.""</span></p> <p><span>  The  above  is  a  very  attractive</span><span>  picture,  but  in  places  it  rubs  up</span><span>  against  some  rough  edges  that  tend</span><span>  to  disfigure  the  painting.  No  men</span><span>  tion  is  made  of  the  incidence  of</span><span>  taxation,  yet  in  view  of  the  com</span><span>  plaints  of  present  manufacturers</span><span>  concerning  the  hampering  effect  of</span><span>  company  taxation,  how  can  the</span><span>  new  organisations  expect  to  oper</span><span>  ate  on  a  basis  that  will  give  a  re</span><span>  turn  on  their  capital  and  enter</span><span>  prise?  Further,  how  does  Mr.  Ded</span><span>  man's  claim  that  the  competence</span><span>  of  Australian  workmen  is  one  of</span><span>  the  things.  attracting  -overseas</span><span>  manufacturers  to  the  Common</span><span>  wealth  square  with  the  serious</span><span>  concern  that  is  being  expressed  at</span><span>  the  steady  decline  in  output  per</span><span>  unit  compared  with  pre-war  fac</span><span>  tory  production?</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  possible,  .of  course,  for-  both</span><span>  these  impediments  to  be  removed.</span><span>  Ft  is  in  the  hands  of  the  people  ot</span><span>  the  Commonwealth  this  year:  to</span><span>  return  a  ;  national  government,</span><span>  pledged  to  the  reduction  of  taxa</span><span>  tion  to  a  plane  which  will  offer</span><span>  incentive  to  both  corporations  and</span><span>  individuals.  Secondly,  there  is</span><span>  growing  opinion-it  found  expres</span><span>  sion  in  the  Federal  Arbitration</span><span>  Court  the  other  day  --  that  the</span><span>  wage  system  should  be  recast  to</span><span>  the  extent  of  making  it  possible</span><span>  for  the  highly  efficient  workman  to</span><span>  be  rewarded  on  his  output,  rather</span><span>  than  all  to  be  reduced  to  the  dead</span><span>  level  of  mediocrity  by  being  placed</span><span>  on  a  flat  rate  for  i  measured  out</span><span>  pnt.  It  is  believed  that  in  this  way</span><span>  only  will  stimulus  be  provided  for</span><span>  that  greater  prodgetio.  which  is</span><span>  the  key  to  most  of  the  economi</span><span>  ill  of  ti  day.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  broad  question  of  the</span><span>  guwth  of  .  .manufacturing  indus</span><span>  tes  'there  rcan  be  no  question  of</span><span>  the  favourable  situation  in  .which</span><span>  Australia,  finds  itself.  Many  new</span><span>  and  advanced  processes  have  been</span><span>  adopted  here  during  the  war,  and</span><span>  much  new  up-to-date  plant  has</span><span>  beeh  installed.  This  sets  the  stage</span><span>  for  expansion,  but  if  industrialisa</span><span>  tion  is  to  bring'  lasting  benefits  it</span><span>  must  be  based  on  sound  and  econ</span><span>  omical  p-oduction.  Today  it  is</span><span>  possible  to  sell  almost  anything</span><span>  that  can  be  produced,  but  it  would</span><span>  be  foolish  to  expect  the  sellers'</span><span>  market  to  last  forever.  Overseas</span><span>  competition  in  many  lines'  must</span><span>  be  encountered  sooner  or  later.  For</span><span>  that  r.easson  .one.thing.to  be  guard</span><span>  ed  against  is  the  establishment  of</span><span>  industries  that  have  little  hope  of</span><span>  surviving  in  later  -years.</span></p> <p><span>  Volume  of  production  is  a  most</span><span>  important  consideration  in  manu</span><span>  facturing,  and  a  recent  report  by</span><span>  the  Tariff  Board  concerning  .  the</span><span>  manufacture  of  refrigerators  as  a</span><span>  bearing  on  this.  Refrigeration  is  a</span><span>  product  well  suited  to  local  manu</span><span>  facture.  Without  questioning  the</span><span>  efficiency  of  individual  makers,  in</span><span>  the  view  of  the  Tariff  Board  the</span><span>  probable  market  -is  too  small  to</span><span>  carry  them  all  economically;  thus</span><span>  the  industry  is  in  danger  of  being</span><span>  burdened  with  exrcessive  overhead</span><span>  and  high  working  expenses  which</span><span>  will  result  in  refrigerators  becom</span><span>  ing  an  even  greater  luxury  than</span><span>  before  the  war.  That  prospect</span><span>  comes  up  rather  sharply  against</span><span>  the  widespread  belief  that  refrig</span><span>  eration  is  one  of  the  things  th-it</span><span>  will  be  reduced  in  selling  price  to</span><span>  bring  it  within  the  reach  of  a</span><span>  larger  public.  Today  there  is  prac</span><span>  tically  no  competition  in  prices.  In</span><span>  this  and  in  other  things  it  has</span><span>  been  found  that,  under  excessively</span><span>  high  protection,  there  were  ever  in</span><span>  creasing  costs  -of  production  and</span></p> <p><span>  .onsequlent  limitation  in  the</span><span>  growth  of  demand..</span></p> <p><span>  These  things  go  to  show  that,</span><span>  encouraging  as  is  the  report  of  the</span><span>  Ministry  for  Post-war  Reconstruc</span><span>  tion  of  big  new  industries  about  to</span><span>  be  embarked  on.  it  is  not  all</span><span>  smooth  sailing.  and  may  involve</span><span>  many  changes  jin  our  taxation,  in</span></p> ",Article,1946-08-02,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON, FRIDAY, AUGUST 2, 1946.

The  stand  of  the</span><span>  ne-  Hanlon  Government  is  maybe</span><span>  the  more  striking  through  being</span><span>  in  contrast  with  the  feeble  show</span><span>  at  Canberra,  but  it  is  none  the  less</span><span>  welcome  on  that  account.

In  1913,  for</span><span>  instance,  it  is  shown  that  93.8  per</span><span>  cent  of  all  disputes  were  over</span><span>  wages,  hours  of  labour,  employ-</span><span>  ment  of  union  members,  working</span><span>  conditions  and  sympathy,  and  only</span><span>  6.2  per  cent  were  due  to  ""other</span><span>  causes.""  Averaged  over  the  three</span><span>  years  1937-9  ""other  causes""  had</span><span>  risen  to  22  per  cent  of  the  total</span><span>  disputes,  and  averaged  x»ver  1941</span><span>  3  they  amounted  to  30  per  cent</span><span>  of  the  total.

Owing  to  thi</span><span>  lengthy  incubation  period-thre&lt;</span><span>  to  four  years-their  condition  re</span><span>  inained  undetected  for  years  au&lt;</span><span>  the  place  of  infection  is  no</span><span>  easily  determined.  But  it  ha</span><span>  been  established,  over  a  xmmbe</span><span>  of  years,  that  this  district  is  on«</span><span>  of  the  Queensland  foci  in  ant</span><span>  around  which  leprosy  is  makin]</span><span>  headway.  Not  that  this  distric</span><span>  is  quite  unique  in  that  regard,  a:</span><span>  relatively  to  population  the  re</span><span>  ported  cases  of  this  disease  hav</span><span>  increased  in  Australia,  there  bein]</span><span>  a  leper  for  every  60,325  persom</span><span>  in  the  population  in  1926,  and  om</span><span>  for  every  16,140  persons  in  1943</span><span>  In  Queensland  the  population  pei</span><span>  reported  case  of  leprosy  fell  fron</span><span>  12.050  in  1926  to  0459  in  1943</span><span>  but  the  disease  has  a  differen</span><span>  significance  here.  The  Queens</span><span>  land  Director-General  of  Healtl</span><span>  and  Medical  Services  stated  ii</span><span>  his  annual  report  for  1943-44  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""Only  In  Queensland  does  lepros;</span><span>  represent  a  problem  among  whit</span><span>  people  in  Australia,  'the  total  suet</span><span>  cases  in  this  State  being  greatei</span><span>  than  those  in  aU  other  States  pal</span><span>  together.""</span></p> <p><span>  Bather-  than  an  occasion  foi</span><span>  despair,  this  statement  is  on«</span><span>  that  should  prompt  enlightened</span><span>  investigation  not  only  of  the  inci-</span><span>  dence  and  spread  of  the  disease,</span><span>  but  of  the  possibilities  of  itt</span><span>  treatment  and  cure.  So  far  ai</span><span>  is  known  to  us,  Australia  hat</span><span>  contributed  to  humanity  little</span><span>  knowledge  of  this  scourge,  and</span><span>  excepting  for  the  ameliorating</span><span>  effects  of  certain  oils  our  know-</span><span>  ledge  of  it  is  little  more  in  this</span><span>  year  of  grace  than  it  was  in  th«</span><span>  days  when  Moses  enunciated  thc</span><span>  law  for  the  leper.  Although  bel</span><span>  men  of  science  have  made  theil</span><span>  mark  on  the  scroll  of  achievement,</span><span>  there  has  been  little  or  no  research</span><span>  into  leprosy  in  Australia,  nor  is</span><span>  there  any  going  forward  now.  In</span><span>  one  Australian  University  at</span><span>  least,  and  as  the  State  most</span><span>  affected  as  to  its  white  population</span><span>  it  could  well  be  in  Queensland,</span><span>  there  should  be  a  leprosy  clink</span><span>  to  keep  pace  with  research  work</span><span>  overseas  among  the,  new  sulfa</span><span>  drug  derivatives-diasone  and</span><span>  pro  min.  Another  hope  for  suf-</span><span>  ferers  is  in  streptomycin  derived</span><span>  like  penicillin  from  the  soil,  but</span><span>  Australia  should  not  hang  bade</span><span>  for  the  results  of  other  workers.</span><span>  The  prize-hope  and  relief  for</span><span>  over  2,000,000  known  sufferers  in</span><span>  the  British  Empire-should  ensure</span><span>  many  earnest  entrants  in  the</span><span>  fight.  If  not  demanded  by  com-</span><span>  mon  humanity,  the  disquieting</span><span>  spread  of  the  scourge  in  the  last</span><span>  few  years  demands  Australian</span><span>  active  participation  in  the  name</span></p> <p><span>  of  common  caution.</span></p> <p><span>  But  all  aspects  of  the  disease</span><span>  are  not  responsive  to  drugs  or</span><span>  affected  by  the  triumphs  in  recent</span><span>  years  of  chemotherapy.'  The  psy-</span><span>  chological  side  is  no  less  import-</span><span>  ant,  foremost  in  which  is  to  build</span><span>  up  a  new  and  more  compassionate</span><span>  attitude  toward  the  sufferer,  go  as</span><span>  to  erase  from  his  mind  and  life</span><span>  the  stigma  born  of  modern</span><span>  society's  prejudice.  The  name</span><span>  ""leper,""  abhorred  through  more</span><span>  than  2000  years,  might  be  changed</span><span>  to  ""  Hansen's  disease,""  so  honour-</span><span>  ing  the  discoverer  of  the  leprosy</span><span>  bacillus  and  banishing  the  terrify</span><span>  in  JJ  implications  that  have  grown</span><span>  up  round  the  old  name.  The  fight</span><span>  against  tuberculosis  was  aided  tre-</span><span>  mendously  when  people  found  that</span><span>  they  were  no  longer  suffering</span><span>  from  consumption.</span></p> <p><span>  Up  to  30  years  ago  little  ad-</span><span>  vance  had  been  'made  in  preven-</span><span>  tive  measures  against  leprosy</span><span>  since,  in  Biblical  times  and  in  the</span><span>  Middle  Ages,  segregation  was  the</span><span>  only  measure  In  common  use.</span><span>  That  condition  prevails  in  Queens-</span><span>  land  today,  where  a  leprosy  vic-</span><span>  tim  is  not  only  a  social  outcast</span><span>  because  of  his  misfortune,  but  is</span><span>  snatched  from  the  bosom  of  his</span></p> <p><span>  family  and  flung  into  a  living</span><span>  tomb  on  Peel  Island,  where  the</span><span>  amenities  are  little  in  advance  of</span><span>  those  of  the  Middle  Ages.  It  is</span><span>  a  standing  disgrace  to  a  succes-</span><span>  sion  of  administrations  over  45</span><span>  years  that  Peel  Island  still  has</span><span>  no  proper  water  supply,  is  still</span><span>  using  a  pan  sanitary  system  and</span><span>  naked  lights,  and  has  no  telephone</span><span>  for  use  of  patients.  An  urgent</span><span>  request  of  a  Central  Queensland</span><span>  husband  for  an  extension  of  a</span><span>  telephone  to  his  wife's  quarters</span><span>  was  refused  by  Mr  Foley,  Minis-</span><span>  ter  for  Health  and  Home  Affairs,</span><span>  on  the  17th  ultimo  because  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""...  the  granting  of  permission  in</span><span>  this  case  would  involve  a  similar</span><span>  policy  in  respect  to  all  other  patients,</span><span>  with  attendant  results  likely  to  inter-</span><span>  fere  with  treatment.""</span></p> <p><span>  This  letter  reveals  that  in  this</span><span>  regard,  but  unlike  all  other  hos-</span><span>  pitals,  Peel  Island  shall  be  as</span><span>  Boggo  Boad  ;  and  also  suggests</span><span>  that  an  institution  which  lost  by</span><span>  death  27  per  cent  of  aU  first  ad-</span><span>  missions  between  the  years  1925</span><span>  and  1937  inclusive  has  something</span><span>  unique  in  the  treatment  of  lep-</span><span>  rosy,  unknown  to  the  rest  of  the</span><span>  world,  that  depends  for  its  effi-</span><span>  cacy  upon  virtual  solitary  con-</span><span>  finement  of  the  patient.

What  does  the  admission</span><span>  mean  and  what  are  its  implica-</span><span>  tions  in  respect  of  other  countries</span><span>  which  also  labour  under  the  evils</span><span>  of  the  black  market</span></p> <p><span>  If  it  were  an  indication  that  the</span><span>  whole  field  of  black  marketing  had</span><span>  assumed  proportions  that  placed  it</span><span>  beyond  hope  of  control  by  lawful</span><span>  authority,  it  would  indeed  be  a</span><span>  gloomy  outlook.  But  it  is  note-</span><span>  worthy  that  the  admission  of  de-</span><span>  feat  is  made  only  in  respect  of</span><span>  black  marketers  in  wine,  adding</span><span>  further  testimony  to  something</span><span>  that  has  been  noted  wherever  ti.e</span><span>  black  marketer  has  reared  his</span><span>  head-that  the  illicit  trader  in</span><span>  liquor  is  hardest  to  lay  by  the</span><span>  .heels,  though  on  the  face  of  things</span><span>  he  really  should  be  the  easiest.</span></p> <p><span>  On  a  broader  plane  the  incident</span><span>  raises  the  question  of  how  it</span><span>  comes  'about  that,  in  the  second</span><span>  year  of  the  peace,  something  that</span><span>  was  looked  upon  as  a  purely  war-</span><span>  time  symptom  should  be  flourish-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  to  an  extent  greater  than  ever  j</span><span>  before?  In  France  it  certainly</span><span>  cannot  be  laid  at  the  door  of  in-</span><span>  adequate  penalties,  since  the  firing</span><span>  6quad  and  the  long  term  prison</span></p> <p><span>  sentence  exact  retribution  for</span><span>  trafficking  in  food  commodities.

It</span><span>  would  be  interesting  to  know  how</span><span>  many  shortages,  in  consumer</span><span>  goods,  have  been  artificially  crea-</span><span>  ted  in  order  to  have  something</span><span>  else  that  could  be  sold  ""under  the</span><span>  lap""  at  a  higher  price,  of  course.</span><span>  At  the  moment  the  air  is  thick</span><span>  with  conflicting  statements  as  to</span><span>  whether  there  is  a  world  glut  or  a</span><span>  famine  in  ?  grain,  and  the  same</span><span>  thing  prevails  in  respect  of  nearly</span><span>  everything,  down  to  Australia's</span><span>  stocks  of  cigarette  papers'.

If  the  black  marketer  in</span></p> <p><span>  I  liquor  has  been  able  to  laugh  at</span><span>  I  governments  it  is  because  of  co</span><span>  I  operation,  or  willingness  to  be</span><span>  duped,  on  the  part  of  those  who</span><span>  have  themselves  had  access  to  the</span><span>  ""easy  money,""  by  some  other  form</span><span>  of  black  marketing,  or  sume  equal-</span><span>  ly  dubious  means.  These  people</span><span>  will  pay  anything  for  the  luxuries</span><span>  with  >  which  they  would  indulge</span><span>  themselves.

If  the  Government</span><span>  got  the  same  aid  from  this  quai</span><span>  ter  as  do  the  black  marketers</span><span>  there  soon  would  be  an  end  of  tin</span></p> <p><span>  rackets.</span></p> <p><span>  In  America  a  movement  is  gain</span><span>  ing  momentum  tn  resist  risiuj</span><span>  prices  by  refusing  to  buy.

The  recard</span><span>  ed  references  to  hidden  treasure</span><span>  go  back  a  long  way.  In  Matthew</span><span>  xiii,  44,  there  is  the  parable  of</span><span>  the  treasure  hid  in  a  field,  and</span><span>  from  Roman  days  laws  have  been</span><span>  made  about  it.'  In  Roman  law  it</span><span>  was  called  ""thesaurus""  and  defined</span><span>  as  an  ancient  deposit  of  money</span><span>  found  accidentally.  Under  the  em-</span><span>  perors,  half  went  to  il  e  finder  and</span><span>  half  to  the  owner  of  the  land  who</span><span>  might  be  the  emperor,  the  public</span></p> <p><span>  treasury  or  some  other  proprietor.  !</span><span>  Property  found  in  the  sea  or  on  the  j</span><span>  earth  has  at  no  time  been  looked  I</span><span>  upon  as  treasure  trove.  If  the</span></p> <p><span>  owner  cannot  be  ascertained  it  be-  j</span></p> <p><span>  comes  the  property  of  the  ñnder.  |</span><span>  Âs  the  feudal  system  spread  over</span><span>  Europe  and  the  prince  was  looked</span><span>  upon  as  the  ultimate  owner  of  all</span><span>  land,  his  right  to  treasure  trove  be-</span><span>  came  recognised  and  established.</span><span>  Tn  England  for  centuries  «he  right</span><span>  to  treasure  trove  has  been  in  the</span><span>  Crown,  who  may  grant  it  out  as</span></p> <p><span>  a  franchise.</span></p> <p><span>  The  English  law  relating  to</span><span>  treasure  trove  goes  back  as  far  as</span><span>  1270,  in  which  year  the  Statute</span></p> <p><span>  ""De  officio  coronatoris""  states  that  j</span><span>  the  Coroner  is  enjoitsd  to  inquire  '</span></p> <p><span>  as  to  treasure  trove.  The  Coroner's</span><span>  Act  of  1887  continues  that  power.</span><span>  Articles  which  are  found  hidden</span></p> <p><span>  thus  are  presumed  to  have  once</span><span>  had  an\  owner,  and  rn  his  absence</span><span>  they  belong  not  to  the  finder  but</span><span>  to  the  King.  Those  who  stumble</span><span>  upon  hidden  treasure  or  gain  know-</span><span>  ledge  of  it  are  bound  to  report  it</span><span>  to  the  Coroner,  who  must  hold  an</span><span>  ""inquest""^  to  determine  whether</span><span>  the  discovery  is  treasure  trove  or</span><span>  not.  Concealment  is  an  indictable</span><span>  offence  although  it  is  not  a  crim-</span><span>  inal  one  unless  accompanied  by  in-</span><span>  tent  to  appropriate.  It  is  settled</span><span>  law  in  England  that  unless  the</span></p> <p><span>  ""treasure  without  owner""  can  be</span></p> <p><span>  proved  to  have  been  hidden  it  is</span></p> <p><span>  not  treasure  trove.  Whether  it  has</span><span>  been  hidden  is  determined  from  the</span><span>  manner  in  which  it  is  laid  when</span><span>  found.</span></p> <p><span>  In  India,  where  the  Treasure</span><span>  Trove  Act  defines  treasure  as</span><span>  ""anything  of  value  hidden  in  the</span><span>  soil,""  an  inquiry  is  held  upon</span><span>  notice;  if  declared  ownerless  the</span><span>  finder  has  three-fourths  and  the</span><span>  owner  of  the  ground  one-fourth.</span><span>  The  Government,  however,  has  the</span><span>  right  of  pre-emption.  In  the  Unit«</span><span>  ed  States  the  common  law,  follow-</span><span>  ing  English  precedent,  would  seem</span><span>  to  give  treasure  trove  to  the  public</span><span>  treasury,'but  in  practice  the  finder</span><span>  has  been  allowed  to  keep  it.  In</span><span>  Louisiana,  where  French  codes  have</span><span>  been  followed,  one  half  goes  to</span></p> <p><span>  the  finder  and  one  half  to  the</span><span>  owner  of  the  land.  France,  Ger-</span><span>  many,*  Italy  and  Spain  ru  pre-total</span><span>  italian  days  followed  the  fifty</span><span>  fifty  rule.  In  Austria  a  third  goes</span></p> <p><span>  to  the  finder,  a  third  to  the  owner  {</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  land  and  a  third  to  the</span><span>  State.  In  parts  of  Russia,  the  Bal-</span><span>  tic  Provinces  and  Poland  it  used  to</span><span>  be  the  law  to  divide  the  treasure</span><span>  between  the  owner  of  the  land  and</span><span>  the  finder,  but  in  the  greater  part</span><span>  of  Russia  ft  belonged  exclusively</span><span>  to  the  owner  of  the  bind,  which</span><span>  also  is  believed  to  have  been  the</span><span>  ancient  Hebrew  custom.</span></p> <p><span>  The  present  age  of  hlack  mar-</span><span>  ket  money  and  camouflaged  in-</span><span>  comes  could  easily  lay  the  founda-</span><span>  tions  of  many  treasure  trove  finds</span><span>  at  a  later  period  wher1  the  con-</span><span>  creted  floors  of  garages  and  similar</span><span>  repositories  give  up  their  secrets.</span><span>  The  great  drawback  to  that  antici-</span><span>  pation,  however,  is  that  treasure</span><span>  today  consists  almost  exclusively</span><span>  of  paper  money.  Now  is  the  time</span><span>  to  find  ;  nd  not  to  plant  hidden</span><span>  treasure.

The  physical  part  which</span><span>  has  been  won  Í6  easier  by  far</span><span>  dian  the  moral  or  spiritual  part</span><span>  which  is  just  beginning.  The  Nazis</span><span>  and  Japanese  were  not  troubled,</span><span>  during  their  temporary  ascendancy,</span><span>  with  any  of  those  finer  points</span><span>  that  are  cropping  up  now  to  pro</span><span>  ride  headaches  for  the  Allies.  They</span><span>  simply  clapped  enemy  folk  into  one</span><span>  kind  of  prison  or  another  and  al-</span><span>  lowed  the  horrors  to  accumulate</span><span>  thereafter  at  compound  interest.</span><span>  Early  in  the  war  an  American  pa-</span><span>  per  asked  the  Allies  to  state  what</span><span>  it  was  for  which  they  were  fight-</span><span>  ing,  whereupon  Mr  Churchill  re-</span><span>  plied:  ""If  we  knock  off  fighting</span></p> <p><span>  vouH  soon  find  out.""  A  shocked</span><span>  world  found  out  after  the  Allies</span><span>  flung  open  the  gates  of  Belsen  and</span><span>  Dachau,  and  what  We  have  to  rea-</span><span>  lise  is  that  that  was  the  easy  way</span><span>  to  treat  the  vanquished,  and  it</span><span>  was  against  that  very  outrage</span><span>  threatening  the  laws  of  humanity</span><span>  that  the  Allies  fought.  Having  won</span><span>  it  is  their  plain,  simple  duty  to</span><span>  deal  with  the  multitudinous  prob-</span><span>  lems  affecting  those  enemies  who</span><span>  fell  into  their  hands  as  to  be  sn  in-</span><span>  spiration  and  lesson  to  countless</span><span>  generations  that  are  to  follow.</span></p> <p><span>  With  the  nerves  of  the  world</span><span>  frayed  and  on  edge  it  has  been</span><span>  easy  to  make  mistakes.  It  would</span><span>  have  been  easy  had  there  been  no</span><span>  millions  of  helpless,  displaced</span><span>  people  to  get  back  to  their  homes,</span><span>  many  of  which  had  been  blown</span><span>  into  thin  air.  There  were  internees</span></p> <p><span>  and  prisoners  of  war,  many  of</span><span>  them  ill  and  so  requiring  special</span><span>  accommodation  as  they  were  re-</span><span>  turned  to  their  homes;  there  were</span><span>  refugees  bent  upon  escaping  from</span><span>  they  knew  not  what,  and  others</span><span>  with  only  too  vivid  a  memory  of</span><span>  the  horror  which  they  tried  to</span><span>  leave  behind.  There  were  displaced</span><span>  populations-millions  of  people</span><span>  living  in  strange  territory  to</span><span>  which  they  had  been  ruthlessly</span><span>  transplanted;  and  there  were  mil-</span><span>  lions  of  others  who  merely  roam-</span><span>  ed  devastated  Europe'  with  nc</span><span>  knowledge  of  where  they  lived  01</span><span>  who  they  were.  It  would  have  been</span><span>  easy  to  follow  the  Nazi  technique</span><span>  and  throw  a  cordon  round  Europe</span><span>  and  leave  it  to  its  misery,  looking</span><span>  in  a  few  years  later  to  deal  with</span><span>  the  lesser  problem.  Then  there</span><span>  were  millions  oí  soldiers  who  wer«</span><span>  thousands  of  miles  from  theil</span><span>  homes  and  mostly  anxious  to  gel</span><span>  back.  But  all  of  them,  internees</span><span>  refugees,  prisoners  of  war,  wa  iii</span><span>  and  strays  and  soldiers  needed</span><span>  food  and  shelter,  and  that  left  un-</span><span>  touched  the  wants  of  millions  ol</span><span>  civilians  in  lands  that  had  nol</span><span>  been  over-run,  wants  that  had  ac</span><span>  cumulated  ^  over  .  afar  years  of  war</span><span>  and  the  desire  for  them  was  nevei</span><span>  stronger  than  now.</span></p> <p><span>  There  never  was  on  earth  mon</span><span>  unsatisfied  wants  than  are  plaguinj</span><span>  humanity  now,  there  never  wen</span><span>  more  wrongs  to  be  righted  or  mon</span><span>  demands  upon  the  services  of  ele</span><span>  mentary  justice,  and  there  neve:</span><span>  waa  a  greater,  need  for  tolerance</span><span>  for  patience  or  for  disinterest*</span><span>  service.  There  is  need,  too,  fo</span><span>  strong  faith  in  the  inherent  goo«</span><span>  that  is  of  humanity,  for  withou</span><span>  that  faith  and  that  inherent  goo</span><span>  there  would  be  nothing  to  save  u</span><span>  from  the  pit.</span></p> <p><span>  If  raising  the  weak  and  punish</span><span>  ing  the  wicked  formed  the  onl</span><span>  task  confronting  the  Allied  nation</span><span>  the  task  would  still  be  on  a  seal</span><span>  unprecedented  in'  human  histor]</span><span>  But  that  is  only  one  side  of  ti</span><span>  grim  picture.

Only  for  a  time,  however,  foi</span><span>  the  tide  receded  and  left  Westwood</span><span>  as  ill-equipped  as  ever  to  fight  thc</span><span>  war  against  tuberculosis.

Tee  it  is  an  im-</span><span>  portant  decision  fraught  with  vital</span><span>  consequences  to  the  electorate  ae  a</span><span>  whole  and  to  the  Government.</span></p> <p><span>  The  decision  to  hold  the  referen-</span><span>  dum  on  the  same  date  as  the  elec-</span><span>  tion  is  of  no  little  moment.  It  will</span><span>  mean  a  considerable  saving  in  tax-</span><span>  payers'  money  for  one  thing,</span><span>  though  that  is  hardly  likely  to</span></p> <p><span>  have  been  the  main  consideration.</span></p> <p><span>  Hitherto  parliamentary  opinion  has</span><span>  been  against  holding  an  election</span><span>  and  a  referendum  on  the  same</span><span>  date,  on  the  ground  that  it  carries</span><span>  too  many  risks.  There  are  obvious</span><span>  reasons  for  anxiety.  The  record  of</span><span>  attempts  to  affect  constitutional</span><span>  amendments  by  popular  vote  shows</span><span>  a  consistent  series  of  failures,  and</span><span>  the  member  holding  a  doubtful</span><span>  seat  might  be  excused  if  assailed</span><span>  by  a  fear  that  as  the  elector  votes</span><span>  on  the  referendum  so  may  he  vote</span><span>  In  the  election  of  a  representative.</span></p> <p><span>  These  considerations  no  doubt</span></p> <p><span>  played  a  part  in  influencing  the</span><span>  Caucus  in  whittling  down  the  pro-</span><span>  posed  amendments  to  make  them</span><span>  as  least  controversial'  as  possible.</span><span>  There  is  none  of  the  ""take  it  or</span><span>  leave  it""  tone  that  accompanied</span><span>  the  last  poll,  when  a  dozen  or  more</span><span>  issues  were  wrapped  into  one  par-</span><span>  cel.  The  reception  which  this  re-</span><span>  ceived  at  the  hands  of  the  .elector-</span><span>  ate  must  still  be  a  matter  of  un</span></p> <p><span>  happy  memory  to  eome  influential</span></p> <p><span>  members  of  the  Government.</span></p> <p><span>  On  this  occasion  the  referendum</span><span>  issues  have  been  reduced  to  three.</span><span>  One  of  them  seeks  power  to  insti-</span><span>  tute  social  service  benefits.  That  is</span><span>  something  about  which  there  can</span><span>  be  little  or  no  dispute,  beyond  the</span><span>  contention  that  many  of  these  bene-</span><span>  fits  should  be  on  a  contributory</span><span>  basis.  Everyone  must  agree  that</span><span>  social  services  must  apply  to  all</span><span>  the  people  of  the  Commonwealth,</span><span>  and  the  National  Parliament  should</span><span>  have  adequate  ;  -were  to  deal  with</span></p> <p><span>  the  matter.</span></p> <p><span>  The  second  question-that  of  ac-</span><span>  quiring  power  for  the  orderly  mar-</span><span>  keting  of  primary  products-is</span><span>  another  thing  to  which  there  is  no</span><span>  deep-rooted  opposition,  provided</span><span>  that  free  trade  between  the  States,</span><span>  which  is  an  integral  part  of  the</span><span>  Constitution,  is  guaranteed.  It  is</span><span>  i  admitted  that  there  is  a  gap  in</span><span>  Commonwealth  powers  in  respect</span><span>  of  the  marketing  of  primary  pro-</span><span>  ducts;  but  when  thi  Lyons  Gov-</span><span>  ernment  in  1937  sought  to  secure</span><span>  marketing  powers  by  way  of  a  new</span><span>  section  of  the  Constitution  they</span><span>  were  opposed  by  the  Labour  Party,</span><span>  which  appealed  to  the  voters  to</span><span>  reject  the  application.  The  same</span><span>  thing  might  have  occurred  this</span><span>  time  with  the  battle  lines  reversed,</span><span>  but  the  Opposition  leader  has  in-</span><span>  timated  that  they  will  adopt  a</span></p> <p><span>  more  reasonable  attitude.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  the  third  question  which</span><span>  will  arouse  most  controversy.  This</span><span>  is  the  granting  of  powers  to  pre-</span></p> <p><span>  scribe  terms  and  conditions  in  in-</span><span>  dustry.  The  snag  is  not  what  the</span></p> <p><span>  Government  proposes  to  do,  but</span></p> <p><span>  »I..«  ri.  _u  j_  '  f  _,  i  ..</span></p> <p><span>  what  it  could  do  if  granted  the</span><span>  powers  it  is  asking.  It  is  perhaps</span><span>  desirable,  even  imperative,  for  all</span><span>  political  parties  to  agree  as  to</span><span>  what  industrial  powers  are  genu-</span><span>  inely  needed  by  the  Common-</span></p> <p><span>  wealth.  The  Prime  Minister  has</span><span>  made  no  effort  to  secure  this  agree-</span><span>  ment,  but  bas  made  the  matter  one</span><span>  solely  for  the  Caucus  and  has</span><span>  thereby  handicapped  himself  with</span><span>  a  disadvantage  by  inviting  opposi-</span><span>  tion.  Perhaps  Labour  thinks  that</span><span>  by  promising  anything  and  every-</span><span>  thing  in  the  way  of  a  shorter</span><span>  working  week  and  increased  basic</span><span>  wage  the  electors  will  vote  ""Yes""</span><span>  to  the  appeal  for  these  powers.  It</span><span>  may  not  work  out  that  way,  and</span><span>  in  any  case  it  is  not  the  proper</span><span>  atmosphere  in  which,  to  argue  con-</span><span>  stitutional  changes.</span></p> <p><span>  A  better  method  is  suggested  in</span><span>  the  Liberal  Party's  policy.  That  is,</span><span>  to  convene  a  Federal  convention</span><span>  composed  nf  all  parties  and  inter-</span><span>  ests  to  draft  those  reforms  in  the</span><span>  Constitution  which  experience  has</span><span>  shown  to  be  desirable.

Almost</span><span>  with  the  pleasant  surprise  at-</span><span>  tached  to  making  a  new  discovery</span><span>  they  found  themselves  actually  en-</span><span>  joying  the  experience.  They  maj</span><span>  also  nave  inquired  what  it  was</span><span>  that  had  caused  them  to  keep</span><span>  away  from  these  gatherings.</span><span>  Whatever  it  was  it  was  not  pres-</span><span>  ent  on  this  occasion»  for  they  were</span><span>  able  to  listen  for  two  and  a  half</span><span>  hours  to  an  intelligent  presentation</span><span>  of  matters  that  affected'  them</span><span>  closely  in  their  daily  lives,  and</span><span>  they  came  away  with  a  sense  of</span><span>  refreshment  of  spirit.</span></p> <p><span>  Of  course  the  night's  programme</span><span>  had  something  to  do  with  it.  Mr</span></p> <p><span>  Menzies  ls  one  who  can  draw  and</span><span>  hold  an  audience  anywhere  at  any</span><span>  time,  and  it  is  not  possible  always</span><span>  to  present  such  a  panel  of  speakers</span></p> <p><span>  as  on  this  occasion.  Bot  that  ia</span><span>  not  the  complete  explanation.  One</span><span>  swallow  does  not  make  a  summer,</span><span>  but  this  gathering  gave  strong  in-</span><span>  dications  that  publie  interest  in</span><span>  political  meetings  may  be  on  the</span><span>  way  back.  If  that  is  so  it  ts</span><span>  something  to  be  welcomed,  and</span><span>  might  mark  a  turning  point  in</span></p> <p><span>  Australian  affairs.</span></p> <p><span>  One  of  tibe  most  noteworthy</span><span>  features  of  this  meeting  was  its</span><span>  orderliness,  and  the  interest  of  the</span><span>  crowd  io  what  was  happening  on</span><span>  the  platform  rather  than  in  some</span><span>  diversion  at  the  rear  of  the  hall,</span><span>  looking  back  in  quest  of  reasons</span><span>  for  the  falling  off  of  public  attend-</span><span>  ance  at  political  meetings,  with-</span><span>  out  question  a  main  cause  wa»</span><span>  the  hooliganism  that  ones  perva-</span><span>  ded  all  non-Labour  meetings.  A</span><span>  political  speaker  does  not  mind  in-</span><span>  terjections,  even  if  they  do  not</span><span>  always  come  into  the  category  of</span><span>  ""intelligent,""  for  he  can  often  turn</span><span>  I  them  to  good  account,  as  was</span></p> <p><span>  ?bown  by  Mr  Menzies,  who  is  *</span><span>  past  master  m  the  art.  But  the</span><span>  right  to  interject  was  abused  so</span><span>  the  point  of  continuous  interrup-</span><span>  tion  which  prevented  the  speaker</span><span>  from  being  heard  and  broke  the</span><span>  thread  of  his  argument.  This</span><span>  rowdyism  waa  absent  from  Fri-</span><span>  day's  meeting.  It  was  not  alto-</span><span>  gether  due  to  a  reformation  on  the</span><span>  part  of  the  interruptora  ;  nor  was</span><span>  it  because  oí  police  surveillance.</span><span>  It  waa  due  simply  to  the  fact  that</span><span>  the  meeting  disciplined  itself.  Any</span><span>  move  towards  concerted  interrup-</span><span>  tion  wa*  promptly  eat  upon  with</span><span>  a  peremptory  demand  to  ""keep</span><span>  quiet  and  let's  hear  him.''  It  hao</span><span>  a  salutary  effect,  far  beyond  any-</span><span>  thing  that  could  have  been</span><span>  achieved  by  pleadings  or  threats</span><span>  from  the  chair.  It  was  evidence</span><span>  that  those  who  came  to  the  meet</span><span>  ing  were  there  to  hear  what  the</span><span>  candidate  and  his  leader  had  to</span><span>  say  and  they  wanted  none  of  th«</span><span>  old  verbal  horseplay  to  distract</span></p> <p><span>  their  attention.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  matter  of  interjections,  it</span><span>  was  inevitable  that  Mr  Menzies</span><span>  should  be  quizzed  about  ""that  pis</span><span>  iron  for  Japan,""  something  that</span><span>  dates  back  to  1939.  Somewhat  tc</span><span>  the  surprise  of  the  interjector,  no</span><span>  doubt,  Mr  Menzies  was  quite  pre</span><span>  pared  to  resurrect  the  pig  iron</span><span>  matter,  but  he  insisted  that  the}</span><span>  bear  with  him  whilst  he  also  re</span><span>  lated  the  story  of  double-dumped</span><span>  wool  and  the  hold-up  of  Du  tel</span><span>  shipping.  By  contrasting  the  ac</span><span>  tion  of  the  Lyons  Government  it</span><span>  squelching  the  attempt  by  a  hand</span><span>  ful  of  Communist-led  wharf  lab</span><span>  ourers  at  Port  Kembla  to  dictate</span><span>  Australia's  trade  relations  with  «</span></p> <p><span>  then  friendly  Power,  with  that  o</span><span>  the  Chifley  Government  in  bowinj</span><span>  the  knee  to  the  Communist-let</span><span>  wharf  labourers  of  1946,  who  heb</span><span>  np  wool  shipments  and  prevente*</span><span>  all  sailings  to  the  N.E.L  M</span><span>  Menzies  scored  in  a  manner  sug</span><span>  gesting  that  the  pig-iron  inciden</span><span>  will  in  future  be  dropped  from  th</span><span>  stock-in-trade  of  his  political  op</span></p> <p><span>  ponente.</span></p> <p><span>  As  to  the  bearing  of  the  merl</span><span>  ing  on  the  Capricornia  contest.

This  hotch-potch</span><span>  of  opinion  is  from  our  nationals</span><span>  who  are  -  presumably  -  friends.</span><span>  Foreigners  are  different.  Edmund</span><span>  Dulac,  born  at  Toulouse  among  the</span><span>  geese,'  called  cricket  ""a  stupid</span><span>  game,""  while  the  divine  Sara  Bern-</span><span>  hardt,  after  watching  a  game  in-</span><span>  tently  for  over  an  hour,  sahl  with</span><span>  great  fervour  ""I  adore  this  foot-</span><span>  ball-it's  so  English!""  Back  among</span><span>  our  nationals,  Woodward  said</span><span>  cricket  ""was  a  rough  and  often  law-</span><span>  less  affair  even  100  years  ago.""</span></p> <p><span>  Somebody  wrote  that  to  him</span><span>  cricket  brought  memories  of  pretty</span><span>  little  meadows,  usually  with  an</span><span>  ancient  church  in  the  background,</span><span>  and  people  with  discriminating</span><span>  taste  in  the  packing  of  a  hamper.</span></p> <p><span>  That  is  not  the  kind  of  cricket  that</span></p> <p><span>  builds  up  the  headlines,  nor  is  it</span><span>  the  kind  that  is  rolling  eastwards</span><span>  like  Nemesis,  its  coming  heralded</span><span>  by  endless  commentaries,  critic-</span><span>  isms,  prophesies,  doubts,  hopes,</span><span>  warnings  and  encouragement.  The</span><span>  blizzard  of  written  and  spoken</span><span>  word,  embellished  with  illustrations</span><span>  and  diagrams  that  is  sweeping  over</span><span>  ns  has  blotted  out  the  internat-</span><span>  ional  horizon,  so  that  if  we  woke</span><span>  some  morning  to  find  through  a  rift</span><span>  in  the  din  that  we  were  at  peace</span><span>  with  our  allies,  the  tidings  would</span><span>  come  a«  it  were  from  another</span><span>  world.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  less  a  matter  of  accident</span><span>  than  of  persistence  that  cricket  is</span><span>  essentially  English.  Half  a  century</span><span>  ago  there  were  really  good,  cricket</span><span>  clubs  in  Philadelphia,'  Denmark  and</span><span>  Holland  also  produced  some  good</span><span>  players,  and  it  was  no  uncommon</span><span>  thing  to  come  upon  cricket  being</span><span>  played  in  places  like  Barbadoes</span><span>  and  Corfu.  But  the  game  is  a  dead</span><span>  letter  today  in  those  places,  it  is</span><span>  less  virulent  than  it  was  in  Canada,</span><span>  in  New  Zealand  and  in  South</span><span>  Africa.  Nert,  to  England,  in  no</span><span>  country  has  cricket  survived  or  is</span><span>  regarded  as  seriously  as  in  Aus-</span><span>  tralia.  Only  posterity  will  know</span><span>  which  of  us  is  right.</span></p> <p><span>  The  peculiar  thing  is  that  with</span><span>  all  the  English  talent  and  taste  For</span><span>  pageantry,  they  have  carried  none</span><span>  of  it  into  cricket.  It  remains  the  j</span><span>  most  soberly-dressed  of  all  games,</span><span>  with  no  clue-as  in  football-to  the</span><span>  identity  of  sides  and  individual</span><span>  players,  other  of  course  than  is  to</span><span>  be  had  from  the  fact  that  nine</span><span>  elevenths  of  the  batting  side  is</span><span>  loafing'in  the  pavilion.  There  is</span><span>  no  lack  qf  precedent  for  brighter</span><span>  cricket  dressing,  as  we  might  even</span><span>  revert  to  the  picturesque  garb  of</span><span>  the  Military  Cricket  Club  formed</span><span>  120  years  ago-the  first  in  Australia</span><span>  -which  took  the.  field  in  whiskers</span><span>  and  black  top  bats.  On  the  other</span><span>  hand  the  lads  of  the  Australian</span><span>  Cricket  Club-formed  goon  after-</span><span>  wards-had  .  the1  option  of  playing</span><span>  bare-headed  or  donning  cabbage</span><span>  tree  hats  adorned  with  broad  blue</span><span>  ribbons  and  streamers*'  But  why  be</span><span>  parochial  ?  How  much  more  life  and</span><span>  colour  would  be  imparted,  to  a</span><span>  match  were  players  arrayed  in  the</span><span>  flashing  hues  of  the  Spanish  pica-</span></p> <p><span>  dor.  Then  we  might  do  something  |</span></p> <p><span>  about  the'umpire.  Traditionally,  he</span><span>  may  wear  his  old  gardening  hat</span><span>  and  a  white  coat  borrowed  from  an</span><span>  ice-cream  vendor,  by  which  rig  -</span><span>  and  the  fact  that  he  is  never  in  a</span><span>  hurry-he  is  identified.  What  a  set-</span><span>  ting  he  offers  for  a  regalia  of  the</span><span>  Victorian  era-knee  breeches,  a</span><span>  coat  of  rich  purple  braided  with</span><span>  gold,  huckle  shoes,  a  wig  and  a</span><span>  triangular  hat  !  *</span></p> <p><span>  But  cricket  was  not  always</span><span>  colourless.  In  the  1882  test  which</span><span>  originated  the  term  ""The  Ashes""</span><span>  when  Spofforth  took  14  wickets  for</span><span>  only  90  runs  one  spectator  dropped</span><span>  dead  and  another  chewed  the  handle</span><span>  off  hig  umbrella!  Then  there  was</span><span>  W-  G.  Grace's  reception  at  Mel-</span><span>  bourne  in  1873  when  he  asked  how</span><span>  waa  the  wicket.  ""Oh.""  said  the</span><span>  groundsman,  ""we  haven't  made  one</span><span>  yet.""  And  co  it  proved.  Not  even  a</span><span>  site  had  been  selected,  and  Grace</span><span>  took  credit  for  ""having  shown  the</span><span>  Australians  how  to  prepare  a</span><span>  wicket.""  Then  in  the  same  year  as</span><span>  their  coach  was  nearing  Stawell  it</span><span>  met  the  band,  turned  out  in  full</span><span>  force  to  welcome  the  distinguished</span><span>  visitors,  at  which  the  horses  took!</span><span>  fright  and  overturned  the  coach,  so</span><span>  that  the  famous  English  Test  team</span><span>  was  all  out  for  nil.  Luckily,  none</span><span>  was  hurt-but,  what  a  theme  for  a</span><span>  modern  Press  or  radio  commenta-</span></p> <p><span>  tor!</span></p> <p><span>  What  is  the  charm  which  cricket</span><span>  hold6  for  maybe  half  of  the  male</span><span>  -population  of  the  British  Empire?</span><span>  Writers  in  their  legions  have  set</span><span>  out  to  tell  us  what  it  is,  and  other  '</span><span>  legions  have  tried  no  less  assidu-</span><span>  ously  to  tell  us  what  it  is  not;  and</span><span>  when  half  a  dozen  cricket  addicts</span><span>  contrive  to  reach  agreement  on  any</span><span>  of,  its  elementary  premises  and</span><span>  concepts,  another  half  dozen  will</span><span>  spring  into  existence  to  prove  the</span><span>  others  wrong.

Seduced  to  quantities</span><span>  money  at  work  increased  by  £80.0)</span><span>  million  between  1939  and  lasi</span><span>  June,  and  money  not  at  work  in</span><span>  creased  by  £291.64  million,  and  u&lt;</span><span>  country  can  afford  that  for  long.</span></p> <p><span>  The  two  great  reservoirs  of  ""OT</span><span>  demand""  money  are  the  saving!</span><span>  bank  deposits  and  trading  bani</span><span>  current  accounts,  as  it  ls  from</span><span>  them  that  the  greater  part  of  th«</span><span>  nation's  housekeeping  expenses  an</span><span>  paid.  Over  the  yean  there  is  main,</span><span>  tained  between  them  a  fairly  cons-</span><span>  tant  ratio,  the  range  being  savinpt</span><span>  bank  88  per  cent  of  the  total  is</span><span>  1932  and  57  of  it  last  year.  Th«</span><span>  method  of  business  in  Australia</span><span>  is  such  that  money  drawn  from</span><span>  savings  banks  to  pay  accounts  of</span><span>  all  kinds  finds  its  way  into  trad-</span><span>  ing  bank  current  accounts,  and</span><span>  thence  through  bank  clearing</span><span>  houses.  It  is  thus  possible  to  de-</span><span>  termine  how  hard  this  trading</span><span>  money  is  working,  i.e^  how  often</span><span>  it  is  being  turned  over.  So,  in</span><span>  1939--the  last  pre-war  year-we</span><span>  find  that  the  aggregate  of  £385.82</span><span>  million  was  turned  over  16  times</span><span>  in  the  course  of  the  year;  in  1942</span><span>  as  the  nation  tuned  into  making</span><span>  things  that  were  to  bs  blown  away</span><span>  and  not  sold,  the  aggregate  of</span><span>  £501.35  million  was  turned  over  14</span><span>  times.  On  the  other  hand,  last  year,</span><span>  with  post-war  plans  on  every  bush</span><span>  and  ""full  employment""  a  political</span><span>  creed,  the  aggregate  of  £998.83  mil-</span><span>  lion  was  turned  over  only  nine</span><span>  times.  That  is  to  say  the  aggregate</span><span>  money  in  these  two  reservoirs  in-</span><span>  creased  between  1939  and  1945  by</span><span>  160  per  cent,  the  bank  clearings</span><span>  many  of  them  war  payments-by</span><span>  only  72  per  cent,  so  that  the  same</span><span>  work  could  have  been  done  on  44</span><span>  per  cent  less,  money.</span></p> <p><span>  Turning  back  the  other  way,  in</span><span>  the  pit  of  depression  the  aggregate</span><span>  amount  in  these  two  reservoirs  wa?</span><span>  £307.13  millions-68  per  cent  of  it</span><span>  in  savings  bank  accounts-and  it</span><span>  was  turned  over  only  five  times  in</span><span>  i  the  year.  It  looks  pretty  meagre,</span><span>  but  adjusted  for  the  diminished</span><span>  vaine  of  money  since  1939  the  turn</span><span>  I  over  per  head  of  population  was</span><span>  j  only  70  per  cent  better  last  year</span><span>  I  than  in  the  pit  of  the  depression,</span><span>  j  and  it  was  13  per  cent  worse  last</span><span>  I  year  than  in  1939,  the  last  pre-,</span></p> <p><span>  war  year.  So  there  is  mach  more</span><span>  to  prosperity  than  a  bank  full  of</span></p> <p><span>  money.  J</span><span>  ^  The^  obvious  key  to  the  situa-,</span><span>  tion  is  production,  which  means</span><span>  getting  people  back  to  work  mak-</span><span>  ing  things  for  other  people  to</span><span>  buy.  There  is  a  vast,  unsatisfied</span><span>  appetite  for  all  kinds  of  human</span><span>  amenities,  a  growing  army  of  folk</span><span>  out  of  work,  banks  that  are  grow</span><span>  I  ing  more  and  more  distended  daily</span></p> <p><span>  and  a  government  that,  when  it</span><span>  j  ran  out  of  silence,  became  vocal  on</span><span>  !  the  matter  of  some  truant  typists.</span><span>  The  only  tangible  evidence  of</span><span>  some  faint  official  apprehension  at</span><span>  the  turn-or  stagnations-of  events</span><span>  is  a  wireless  session  exhorting  all</span><span>  ;  and  sundry  not  to  spend  money!</span></p> <p><span>  I  On  top  of  it  all,  a  handful  of</span><span>  j  Communists  threw  Sydney  into  a</span></p> <p><span>  I  state  of  benightedness  that  wa3</span></p> <p><span>  reminiscent  of  the  farthing  dip</span><span>  days,  and  held  up  §  promising</span></p> <p><span>  trade  with  our  Dutch  neighbours.</span><span>  It  appears  from  the  doings  of  the</span><span>  past  few  weeks  that  not  only  is</span><span>  Australian  industry  and  com-</span><span>  merce  in  the  doldrums.

This</span><span>  time  the  surprise  Has  not  come</span><span>  from  these  sources,  but  from  the</span><span>  intrusion  of  two  minor  groups</span><span>  whose  influence  on  the  poll  will</span><span>  form  thé  subject  of  lively  specula-</span><span>  tion  right  up  to  polling  day.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  view  of  some  students</span></p> <p><span>  of  municipal  politics  the  ideal  con-</span><span>  test  would  be  two  equal  teams</span><span>  of  the  required  number'  and  a</span><span>  clear  ring.  That  has  never  yet</span><span>  been  achieved  and  probably  never</span><span>  will.  ;  nor  is  it  at  all  certain  that</span><span>  it  would  be  the  best  thing.

But  they</span></p> <p><span>  also  want  a  little  elbow  room  to</span></p> <p><span>  ^exercise  an  optional  vote  here  and</span><span>  there.  Some  municipal  parties</span><span>  have  sought  to  give  them  that</span><span>  option  by  putting  'forward  less</span><span>  than  a  full  team;  but  that  has</span><span>  pitfalls,  as  Mayor  Jeffries  discov-</span></p> <p><span>  ered  last  year  when  the  four  votes</span><span>  which  he  did  not  claim  were  spread</span><span>  out  over  the  opposing  ticket  to</span><span>  sufficient  purpose  to  keep  ont  two</span></p> <p><span>  of  his  men.</span></p> <p><span>  This  year  there  are  no  inequali-</span><span>  ties  as  to  numbers  between  thp</span><span>  Mayor's  team  and  the  i  Labour</span><span>  ""ticket.""

Ad-</span><span>  mittedly  a  great  many  by-paths</span><span>  might  require  to  bc  explored  to</span><span>  arrive  at  a  definition  of  the  ""av-</span><span>  erage  citizen,""  but  accepting  a</span><span>  popular  interpretation,  whatever</span><span>  truth  may  have  attached  to  the</span><span>  philosopher's  observation  in  his</span><span>  day  it  is  open  to  challenge  in  our</span><span>  own  times.  As  a  fact  there  is</span><span>  abundant  evidence  that  the  aver-</span><span>  age  citizen  is  not  the  bane  but</span></p> <p><span>  the  boon  of  Society.</span></p> <p><span>  After  the  first  World  War,  H.</span><span>  M.  Tomlinson  paid  an  eloquent  tri-</span><span>  bute  to  the  ""nobodies  who  have</span><span>  won  the  war.""  He  wrote  of  the</span><span>  common  soldiers,  the  ordinary  men</span><span>  of  all  classes,  ranker  or  officer,  who</span><span>  more  than  once  let  down  by  the</span><span>  Great  Men  at  home  and  moje  than</span><span>  once  led  to  disaster  by  the  Great</span><span>  Men  in  the  field  nevertheless  fought</span><span>  on  doggedly,  persistently  and  en-</span><span>  during  all  things  till  victory  was</span><span>  won.  It  was  the  ordinary  man</span><span>  rather  than  the  men  of  genius  who</span><span>  withstood,  outstayed  and  finally</span><span>  defeated  the  forces  that  sought</span><span>  to  enslave  the  world.</span></p> <p><span>  During  the  height  of  the  Luft-</span><span>  waffe's  blitz  on  Britain,  Robert</span><span>  Lynd  wrote  of  a  prevailing  belief</span><span>  Jhat  in  the  interval  between  the</span><span>  ending  of  the  first  world  war  and</span><span>  1939  the  average  man  had  declined</span><span>  in  spirit  and  character.  There</span><span>  was  plenty  of  slackness  in  the  air,</span><span>  it  was  true,  but  it  was  manifest</span><span>  not  amongst  the  ordinary  men  and</span><span>  women  but  amongst  elderly  lead-</span><span>  ers  and  men  of  fame.  There  also</span><span>  was  jazzing  and  cocktail  drinking</span><span>  and  much  talk  of  the  decadence  of</span><span>  modern  youth.  Yet  when  the  trial</span><span>  came  even  those  who  believed  that</span></p> <p><span>  the  virtues  still  burned  brightly  in</span><span>  the  breasts  of  ordinary  men  and</span></p> <p><span>  women,  stood  amazed  at  the</span><span>  amount  of  goodness  and  courage</span><span>  and  fortitude  which  they  dis-</span><span>  played.  It  is  true  even  in  those</span><span>  hours  there  were  jacks-in-office,</span><span>  black  marketeers,  the  grasping</span><span>  ever  ready  to  turn  human  suffering</span><span>  to  their  personal  advantage;  but</span><span>  under  the  strain  and  stresses  of</span><span>  war  which  came  amongst  them</span><span>  tn  their  dajly  lives  the  mass  of</span><span>  human  beings  showed  themselves</span><span>  to  be  good  beyond  all  power  of</span><span>  phophesy.</span></p> <p><span>  People  living  in  security  usually</span><span>  look  upon  those  who  perform</span><span>  heroic  acts-miners  rescuing  their</span><span>  fellow  workmen,  firemen,  sailors,</span><span>  etc-as  a  race  apart  leading</span><span>  dangerous  lives.  But  the  war</span><span>  showed  that  amongst  men  and</span><span>  women  who  ordinarily  live  in  saf-</span><span>  ety  and  security  valour  could  break</span><span>  out  like  a  flame.  Lighthearted-</span></p> <p><span>  ness,  kindness  and  humour  in  the</span><span>  presence  of  disaster,  reported  so</span><span>  frequently  in  the  newspapers,  was</span><span>  not  propaganda  designed  to  cheer</span><span>  people  up  and  deceive  the  enemy;</span><span>  it  was  .something  that  happened</span><span>  every  hour  of  the  day.  Little</span><span>  surprise  is  felt  at  learning  of  the</span><span>  selflessness  of  some  people.  What</span><span>  is  surprising  is  that  in  the  war</span><span>  ravaged  countries  this  selflessness</span><span>  was  not  the  exception  but  the  rule.</span></p> <p><span>  Is  it  not  possible  that  in  peace</span><span>  as  well  as  in  war  the  average  man</span><span>  can  play  a  pre-eminent  part  in</span><span>  saving  civilisation?  One  thing  the</span><span>  average  citizen  has  proved  is  that</span><span>  he  is  at  his  best  when  he  works</span><span>  with  his  fellow  man  in  some  laud-</span><span>  able  enterprise  or  aspiration.  Ser-</span><span>  vice  clubs  prove  that  to  be  so.  So</span><span>  do  the  Red  Cross,  the  Scout</span><span>  movement,  fraternal  institutions</span><span>  and  numerous  other  associations</span><span>  which  come  readily  to  mind.  It  is</span><span>  in  the  workaday  level  of  life</span><span>  where  men  earn  their  bread  and</span><span>  butter  that  the  average  citizen  can</span><span>  best  prove  through  cooperation</span></p> <p><span>  that  he  is  the  boon  and  not  the</span><span>  bane  of  society.</span></p> <p><span>  To  achieve  the  full  measure  of</span><span>  good  of  which  he  is  capable  there</span><span>  is  one  thing  the  average  citizen</span><span>  must  do:  Get  rid  of  the  com-</span><span>  plex  that  tells  bim  as  an  indi-</span><span>  vidual  he  does  not  count,  that</span><span>  neither  his  voice  nor  his  vote  has</span><span>  any  weight  unless  he  is  ''organ-</span><span>  ised.""  Hope  for  the  future  of  the</span><span>  world  may  come  when  the  aver-</span><span>  age  citizen  himself  realises  that</span><span>  he  is  not  the  bane  of  society.  That</span><span>  realisation  has  not  yet  come  to</span><span>  him,  nor  is  it  transparent  what</span><span>  agency  can  be  found  to  bring  it</span></p> <p><span>  about.</span></p> <p><span>  The  world  anxiously  looks  to</span><span>  the  nations  and  to  the  leaders  to</span><span>  dissolve  the  dangers  that  threaten</span><span>  it  for  the  third  time  within  a</span><span>  lifetime;  but  there  is  a  growing</span><span>  conviction  that  it  should  be  look-</span><span>  ing  to  the  individual  citizen,  with</span><span>  whom  the  real  solution  lies.  When</span><span>  that  timo  comes,  and  it  may  take</span><span>  another  World  War  to  hasten  it</span><span>  tne  average  citizen  may  at  lasi</span><span>  come  into  his  own  to  exercise</span><span>  those  influences  on  the  affairs  oi</span><span>  all  mankind  for  which  he  is  bj</span><span>  nature  fitted,  but  at  present  lacks</span></p> <p><span>  opportunity.</span></p> ",Article,1946-03-16,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON SATURDAY, MARCH 16, 1946.

Commonwealth  ex-</span><span>  perts  agree  that  only  now  is  it</span><span>  realised  how  widespread  and  acute</span><span>  is  the  timber  shortage  in  Europe,</span><span>  the  Middle  EaBt,  Far  East,  the</span><span>  United  States  and  Britain.  The</span><span>  underlying  causes  of  the  world's</span><span>  chronic  wood  shortage  are  basic,</span><span>  and  have  been  exerting  their  ef-</span><span>  fects  for  decades.  The  basic  causes</span><span>  include  deforestation,  inadequate</span><span>  forest  management,  failure  to  de-</span><span>  velop  great  areas  of  mature  for-</span><span>  ests,  incomplete  utilisation  and  in-</span></p> <p><span>  sufficient  technical  control.</span></p> <p><span>  Apart  from  the  injurious  effect</span><span>  of  the  war  the  conditions  of  the</span><span>  world's  forests  give  little  cause  for</span><span>  comfort.

Forest  restoration  will</span><span>  bring  to  these  people  wood  for  fuel</span><span>  and  trees  to  protect  the  lam</span><span>  against  the  erosive  forces  of  wind</span><span>  and  rain.  Jn  short,  afforestation</span><span>  must  be  taken  on  a  scale  never</span><span>  before  dreamed  of.  and  further</span><span>  more  it  must  be  carried  out  on  as</span><span>  international  scale.

The  pinnacle  of</span><span>  political  achievement  in  Russia  is</span><span>  termed  ""tp¡r  dictatorship  of  the</span><span>  proletariat,""  which  is  exactly  how</span><span>  most  English-speaking  people</span><span>  would  describe  Nazi  rule  in  Ger-</span><span>  many  and  Fascist  rule  in  Italy,</span><span>  because  it  means,  literally,  exclus-</span><span>  ive  rule  by  one  of  the  many.</span></p> <p><span>  M.

It  is  the  same  tear</span><span>  that  moved  Hitler  to  start  World</span><span>  War  II.

"<p><span>  The  Morning  Bulletin</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  JUNE  24,  1946.</span></p> <p><span>  DECENTRALISATION  OF</span></p> <p><span>  UNIONISM.</span></p> <p><span>  Decentralisation  is  very  much  to</span><span>  thc  fore  these  days.  Decentralis-</span></p> <p><span>  ation  of  administration  has  been</span></p> <p><span>  a  recognised  policy  almost  since</span><span>  the  inception  of  autonomous  gov-</span><span>  ernment  in  Queensland,  whilst  to-</span><span>  day  the  principle  and  practice  of</span><span>  decentralisation  of  industry  is</span><span>  commanding  widespread  support</span><span>  and  practically  no  opposition.  Re-</span><span>  flection  leads  to  the  conclusion  that</span><span>  all  other  ""decentralisation""  can  be</span><span>  of  little  value  unies»  there  is  al*o</span><span>  decentralisation  of  trades  union</span><span>  contrat  Emphasis  is  laid  upon  this</span><span>  by  the  application  now  before  the</span><span>  Registrar  of  the  Industrial  Court</span><span>  for  registration  of  the  Central</span><span>  Queensland  ''Meat  Employees'  Union</span><span>  which  is  intended  to  embrace  em-</span><span>  ployees  at  the  Lakes  Creek  meat-</span></p> <p><span>  works  who  wish  to  detach  them-</span><span>  selves  from  the  AMIEU.</span></p> <p><span>  That  there  are  grounds  for  the</span><span>  move  is  beyond  dispute.  For  fifteen</span><span>  weeks  the  employees  at  the  local</span><span>  meatworks  have  been  idle  under</span><span>  orders  from  a  disputes  committee</span></p> <p><span>  in  Brisbane.  Few  of  them  know</span></p> <p><span>  why  they  were  ordered  to  drop</span><span>  work,  excepting  that  it  had  some-</span><span>  thing  to  do  with  four  men  em-</span><span>  ployed  at  a  bacon  factory  at  Mur</span></p> <p><span>  rarie;  ont  au  ot  them  ao  Know</span></p> <p><span>  tbat  it  has  nothing  to  do  with</span><span>  their  own  conditions  of  employment</span><span>  and  relations  with  their  employers.</span><span>  Not  all  of  them  have  yet  realised</span><span>  that  the  strike  drags  on,  and  will</span><span>  continue  to  drag  on,  because  they</span><span>  have  been  led  into  a  stoppage  with</span><span>  the  whole  force  of  the  State  and</span><span>  Federal  industrial  laws  against</span><span>  them.  Under  a  looally-controlled</span><span>  union  they  probably  would  never</span><span>  have  been  led  into  striking  in  the</span><span>  first  place,  and  certainly  would  not</span><span>  have  carried  it  on  so  long  after  it</span><span>  had  ignominiously  failed,  jost  to</span><span>  save  the  face  of  a  few  highly-paid</span><span>  union  «Midáis  who  imagined  they</span><span>  were  superior  to  the  law.</span></p> <p><span>  Apart  front  any  move  for  de-</span><span>  centralisation  of  .control  the  One</span><span>  Big  Union  ideal  looks  like  receiv-</span><span>  ing  a  setback  from  the  current  in-</span><span>  dustrial  outlawry.  The  bacon  fac-</span><span>  tory  employees  id  the  south  are</span><span>  seeking  to  break  away  from  the</span><span>  AMIEU  and  to  form  their  own</span><span>  onion.  This  development  affords  a</span><span>  significant  commentary  on  the  or-</span><span>  iginal  dispute.  It  was  because  of</span><span>  certain  dismissals  at  Murrana</span><span>  bacon  factory  that  the  meatwork</span><span>  ers  throughout  Queensland  were</span><span>  ordered  to  cease  work  and  suffer  a</span><span>  loss  of  wages  aggregating  some-</span><span>  thing  like  £100,000.  Now  the</span><span>  majority  of  the  bacon  factory  em-</span><span>  ployees  want,  to  disentangle  them-</span><span>  selves  from  the  AMIF.U,  a  devel-</span><span>  opment  that  can  hardly  fail  to  east</span><span>  further  doubts  upon  the  merits  of</span><span>  the  original  dispute.  Central  and</span><span>  Northern  meatwnrkcrs  will  prob-</span><span>  ably  entertain  little  objection  to</span><span>  the  bacon  curers  forming  their  own</span><span>  union;  then*  chief  regret  will  be</span><span>  that  they  were  not  in  that  position</span><span>  six  months  ago.</span></p> <p><span>  These  are  not  the  only  signs  of</span><span>  a  challenge  to  union  tyranny.  The</span><span>  fact  that  Sydney  boilermakers  and</span><span>  ironworkers  are  going  on  with  re-</span><span>  pairs  to  a  Dutch  corvette  sug-</span><span>  gests  that  the  despotic  power  thnt</span><span>  has  rilled  the  Ironworkers'  Feder-</span><span>  ation  for  so  long  will  no  longer  be</span><span>  submitted  to  without  question.</span><span>  The  men  who  are  working  on  tba</span><span>  Dutch  ship  contend  that  their</span><span>  union  has  placed  no  ban  upon  such</span><span>  work.  If  this  marks  a  determina-</span><span>  tion  by  rank  and  file  members  of</span><span>  unions  to  know  why  they  have</span><span>  been  ordered  to  cease  work  and</span><span>  under  what  authority  the  orders</span><span>  are  given,  it  will  mark  a  big  ad-</span><span>  vance  towards  the  time  when  they</span><span>  will  demand  a  secret  ballot  on  all</span><span>  strike  issues.</span></p> <p><span>  Nevertheless,  the  decentralisa-</span><span>  tion  of  union  control  and  a  chal-</span><span>  lenge  to  the  assumption  of  power</span><span>  by  strike  fomentera  at  the  head</span><span>  of  tbe  unions  will  lead  nowhere</span><span>  unless  there  is  firm  enforcement</span><span>  by  governments  of  all  industrial</span><span>  laws.  Queensland  today  is  facing</span><span>  ti  most  menacing  strike  tie-up  fa</span><span>  its  history  because  Labour  govern-</span><span>  ments  have  been  loth  to  take  any</span><span>  action  which  will  embroil  them</span><span>  with  militant  union  leaders,  and</span><span>  this  has  led  to  the  latter  taking</span><span>  complete  control  and  doing  just</span><span>  what  they  like.  Lack  of  backbone</span><span>  by  both  State  and  Commonwealth</span><span>  governments  is  the  main  cause  of</span><span>  the  present  industrial  outlawry.</span></p> <p><span>  If  the  governments  will  under</span><span>  tal  -.  to  restore  the  rule  of  law  ia</span><span>  industrial  matters,  and  the  rank</span><span>  and  file  of  unionists  demsnd  the</span><span>  right  of  having  a  say  in  the  con-</span><span>  trol  and  conduct  of  their  affairs,</span><span>  as  is  suggested  by  current  develop-</span><span>  ments,  we  should  not  be  long  in</span></p> <p><span>  seeing  an  end  to  the  present  un-,</span><span>  happy  state  of  affairs.  !</span></p> ",Article,1946-06-24,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON MONDAY, JUNE 24, 1946.

This  showed  that</span><span>  approximately  250  students  who</span><span>  have  been  enrolled  are  receiving</span><span>  instruction  for  only  a  Sew  hours  a</span><span>  day  at  technical  colleges.  They  are</span><span>  receiving  part-time  training  ai  car-</span><span>  pentry,  wood  machining,  joinery,</span><span>  cabinet-making,  plumbing,  arts,</span><span>  accountancy  and  domestic  science,</span><span>  Others  are  receiving  training  in</span><span>  French  polishing,  cabinet  making,</span><span>  bricklaying  and  wood  machining  at</span><span>  approved  industrial  establishments.</span><span>  Ex-servicemen  and  women  who  en-</span><span>  rolled  for  matriculation  subjects</span><span>  are  not  yet  receiving  any  training.</span><span>  Although  full  time  training  facil-</span><span>  ities  do  not  exist  it  is  anticipated</span><span>  that  the  annexes  will  be  operative</span><span>  within  the  next  few  months,  that</span><span>  at  the  Rockhampton  Technical</span><span>  College  to  be  in  working  order  by</span><span>  April.</span></p> <p><span>  Should  this  anticipation  be  real-</span><span>  ised  it  will  remove  a  lot  of  the</span><span>  uncertainty  that  is  gaining  ground</span><span>  in  respect  of  full  time  training,</span><span>  which  so  far  has  hardly  given  pro-</span><span>  mise  of  measuring  np  to  the  very</span><span>  attractive  programme  which  tour-</span><span>  ing  officers  of  the  Department</span><span>  placed  before  ex-servicemen,  em-</span><span>  ployers,  trades  unions  and  repre-</span><span>  sentatives  of  public  bodies  a  few</span><span>  months  back.  If  the  degree  -of</span><span>  training  accorded  the  250  already</span><span>  enrolled  waa  all  that  would  be</span><span>  available  in  future  it  calls  for  no</span></p> <p><span>  imagination  to  realise  the  position</span><span>  when  the  full  impact  of  demobilis-</span></p> <p><span>  ation  comes  to  be  felt.  And  that</span><span>  time  is  at  hand.  As  remarked  by</span><span>  His  Worship  the  Mayor  at  the  wel-</span><span>  come  home  to  servicemen  the  other</span><span>  night,  th«  numbers  coming  out  of</span><span>  the  services  at  this  juncture  must</span></p> <p><span>  serve  as  a  warning  not  only  of  the  i</span><span>  magnitude  of  the  task  of  getting</span><span>  these  people  back  to  civilian  occu-</span><span>  pation,  but  of  the  responsibility  of</span><span>  everyone  towards  the  achievement</span></p> <p><span>  of  that  end.</span></p> <p><span>  The  training  scheme  is  a  very</span><span>  fine  conception  on  paper,  providing</span></p> <p><span>  for  the  instruction  of  the  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  charged  soldier  in  a  chosen  voca-</span><span>  tion  for  which  He  is  adjudged  to  be</span><span>  fitted,  and  for  his  sustenance  un-</span><span>  til  he  is  qualified  to  take  his  place</span><span>  in  industry.  But  like  many  other</span><span>  fine  schemes  it  lacks  some  import-</span><span>  ant  essentials  to  successful  imple-</span><span>  mentation.  One  of  them  is  the  pro-</span><span>  vision  of  centres  where  the  training</span><span>  may  be  imparted,  as-  Brisbane  is</span><span>  about  the  only  place  in  Queensland</span><span>  where  full  time  training  facilities</span><span>  exist.  It  must  be  obvions-even  to</span><span>  Canberra-that  all  who  have  been</span><span>  approved  for  training  cannot  be</span><span>  sent  to  Brisbane  and  that  training</span><span>  centres  must  be  provided  at  least</span><span>  at  Townsville,'  Rockhampton  and</span></p> <p><span>  Cairns.</span></p> <p><span>  The  teaching  resources  of  the</span><span>  technical  colleges  are  at  the  dis-</span><span>  posal  of  the  scheme,  but  the  neces-</span><span>  sary  buildings  and  equipment  are</span><span>  not  available.  That  can  be  under-</span><span>  stood  to  a  certain  extent,  but  what</span><span>  cannot  be  understood  is  the  re-</span><span>  luctance  that  is  said  to  exist  in</span><span>  providing  them.  The  question  of</span><span>  buildings  and  equipment  has</span><span>  shuttled  back  and  forth  between</span></p> <p><span>  the  Education  Department,  the</span><span>  Federal  Department  of  Labour  an¿</span><span>  National  Service  and  the  Depart-</span><span>  ment  of  the  Interior,  and  the  alle-</span><span>  gation  is  made  that  the  Federal  de-</span><span>  partments  are  indulging  in  the  old</span><span>  game  of  ""passing  the  bnck.""  To</span><span>  its  credit  the  State  Education  De-</span><span>  partment  Bays  in  the  words  of  Mr</span><span>  Churchill  used  in  another  con-</span><span>  nexion:  ""Give  us  the  buildings  and</span></p> <p><span>  the  tools  and  we  will  do  thc  job.""</span></p> <p><span>  Thie  is  something  that  should</span><span>  be  brought  to  a  head,  if  there  ia</span><span>  any  attempt  to  escape  responsibil-</span><span>  ity  by  the  Federal  authorities.  Ex</span><span>  eervicemen  and  women  have  been</span><span>  promised  by  the  Commonwealth  all</span><span>  possible  help  to  fit  themselves  for</span><span>  civilian  life.  To  this  end  training</span><span>  in  varions  trades  has  been  assured</span><span>  them,  and  a  scheme  drawn  up</span><span>  which  would  fill  the  bill  and  render</span><span>  inestimable  service  to  all  con-</span><span>  cerned.  But  the  absence  of  suitable</span></p> <p><span>  buildings  placee  a  serious  handicap  j</span><span>  to  implementation  of  the  scheme.</span><span>  If,  as  is  suggested  by  the  state-</span><span>  ment  concerning  the  progress  of</span><span>  the  annexes  in  the  Rockhampton</span><span>  district,  this  handicap  will  shortly</span><span>  be  removed  all  well  and  good.  If</span><span>  such  is  not  the  case  every  effort</span><span>  must  be  made  to  see  that  the</span><span>  écheme  does  not  break  down  on</span><span>  this  account.</span></p> <p><span>  There  are  ex-service  associations</span><span>  aplenty-too  many,  some  think</span><span>  and  from  General  Blamey  down  it</span><span>  is  proclaimed  that  discharged  ser-</span><span>  vicemen  must  not  be  let  down  this</span><span>  time.
