"<p><span>  KOCKtlAntl'I'ON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  APRIL  6,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  WHATEVER  differences  of  opinion  may</span><span>  exist  in  the  community  of  Rockhampton</span><span>  as  to  our  future  railway  policy,  there</span><span>  seems  to  be  almost  general  unanimity  as</span><span>  to  the  desirability  of  proceeding  with  the</span><span>  navigation  improvements  tn  the  Fitzroy</span></p> <p><span>  River.  It  is  well  for  the  town  and</span><span>  district  that  this  should  be  the  case,</span><span>  because  a  disposition  has  been  evinced</span><span>  in  some  quarters  to  suspend  them  till  the</span><span>  Eupatoria  Railway  was  completed.  The</span></p> <p><span>  erection  of  the  wharf  at  Port  Alma  will</span><span>  necessitate  the  construction  of  a  railway,</span><span>  and  as  our  politicians  say,  ""it  will  come  in</span><span>  time.""  Indeed,  the  time  may  come  sooner</span><span>  than  many  anticipate,  for  a  light  railway</span><span>  would  greatly  facilitate  the  traffic  in  con-</span><span>  nection  with  our  import  and  export</span><span>  trade  ;  and  would  afford  ample  accom-</span><span>  modation  for  all  the  requirements  likely</span><span>  to  be  made  upon  it  for  some  years</span></p> <p><span>  to  come.  There  can  be  no  doubt</span></p> <p><span>  it  would  expedite  business,  and  prove  of</span><span>  immense  advantage  to  the  inland  dis-</span><span>  tricts.  But  it  is  only  reasonable  to</span><span>  anticipate  that  the  time  will  come,  when</span><span>  the  immense  trade,  of  which  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  is  bound  to  be  the  port,  shall  exceed</span><span>  the  carrying  capacity  of  even  a  railway</span><span>  with  double  lines  on  the  broad  guage</span><span>  system.  In  America  the  railways,  we</span><span>  are  told,  have  superseded  the  use  of</span><span>  steamers  on  the  Mississippi,  but  there</span><span>  must  be  circumstances  peculiarly  favour-</span><span>  able  to  their  having  done  so,  because  in</span><span>  other  countries  water  carriage  is  most</span><span>  largely  taken  advantage  or  on  account  of</span><span>  its  cheapness.  Notwithstanding  the</span><span>  existence  of  railways  from  London  to</span><span>  numerous  pants  of  the  English  coast,  ttje</span><span>  shipping  trade  of  the  pont  retains  its</span><span>  magnificent  proportions.  Liverpool  and</span><span>  Glasgow  hive  their  deep-water  ports,</span><span>  but  the  expenditure  on  the  docks  at</span><span>  Liverpool  continues,  and  the  dredging</span><span>  of  the  Clyde  never  ceases.  Man-</span><span>  chester  is  not  content  with  the  railway</span><span>  service  to  Liverpool,  though  there  are</span><span>  several  routes,  and  a  movement  is  on</span><span>  .foot  to  connect  it  with  the  Mersey  by  a</span><span>  ship  canal.  On  the  continent  of  Europe</span><span>  similar  movements  show,  that  there  also</span><span>  water  carriage  can  be  conducted  more</span><span>  cheaply  than  land  carriage.  It  would</span><span>  evidently  be  a  mistake,  therefore,  for  the</span><span>  colony  of  Queensland,  which  has  in  the</span><span>  Fitzroy  River,  an  admirable  water-way  to</span><span>  Rockhampton,  to  suspend  the  operations</span><span>  for  the  improvement  of  the  navigation.</span></p> <p><span>  The  contention  of  persons,  who,  from</span><span>  personal  and  interested  motives,  and</span><span>  without  considering  theirdutyascolonists,</span><span>  oppose  the  River  Works,  is  that  the</span><span>  money  will  be  thrown  into  the  river,  both</span></p> <p><span>  literally  and  metaphorically.  Some  go</span><span>  so  far  as  to  say  that  it  shall</span><span>  be  found  impossible  by  any  amount</span><span>  of  expenditure  to  make  the  river</span><span>  permanently  navigable  :  while  others</span><span>  admit  that  it  may  be  done,  but  argue</span><span>  that  the  trade  to  be  developed  will  never</span><span>  justify  the  expenditure,  If  the  canny</span><span>  old  Bailie  Nicol  Jarveis,  who  peered  into</span><span>  the  future  at  the  beginning  of  this</span><span>  century,  and  saw  the  possibilities  of  the</span><span>  American  trade,  which  has  since  made</span><span>  restrained  by  such  doubts  and  fears,  the</span><span>  Glasgow  rich  and  great,  had  been</span><span>  city  on  the  Clyde  would  not  now  have</span><span>  been  the  second  in  size  and  importance</span><span>  in  the  United  Kingdom.  We  only</span><span>  require-to  consider  what  these  enter-</span><span>  prising  and  far  seeing  Scotchmen  have</span></p> <p><span>  done  to  find  a  warrant  for  lavish</span><span>  expenditure  on  the  Fizroy.  In  its</span><span>  infancy  Glasgow  conducted  its  maritime</span><span>  trade  by  means  of  land  carriage</span><span>  and  lightering,  from  Irvine  on</span><span>  the  Aryshire  coast,  and  ultimately</span><span>  from  Port  Glasgow.  The  latter  place</span><span>  was  to  be  the  Port  Alma  of  the  rising</span><span>  town,  and  there  quays  and  docks  were</span><span>  formed.  It  is  not  yet  a  hundred  years</span><span>  since  the  first  quay  was  formed  at  the</span><span>  Broomielaw  in  Glasgow.  At  that  time</span><span>  the  depth  of  the  water  at  the  shallows  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  river  was  little  more  than  three  feet</span></p> <p><span>  The  town  is  twenty  miles  from  the  sea,</span></p> <p><span>  and  there  were  no  doubt  croakers  in</span></p> <p><span>  those  days  ready  to  declare,  as  are  their</span><span>  successors  now,  that  to  attempt  to</span><span>  deepen  such  a  long  channel,  in  which</span><span>  there  were  shifting  sand-banks,  was  utter</span><span>  folly,  and  a  waste  of  the  -public  money.</span><span>  Undeterred  by  the  predictions  of</span><span>  the  prophets  of  evil  the  majority</span><span>  of  the  merchants  raised  money</span><span>  and  proceeded  with  their  river  im-</span><span>  provement  works.  The  result  of  the</span><span>  operations  was  that  fifty  years  ago  there</span><span>  was  a  depth  of  twelve  feet  at  high  water</span></p> <p><span>  at  Glasgow.  In  1840  the  Harbour</span><span>  Trustees  obtained  an  Act  of  Parliament</span><span>  to  give  them  greater  freedom  in  carrying</span><span>  on  their  operations.  Consequent  upon</span><span>  the  latter,  vessels  drawing  fifteen  feet  of</span><span>  water  could  go  up  and  down  the  river  in</span><span>  two  tides.  Now  vessels  drawing  twenty</span><span>  two  feet  of  water,  by  leaving  the</span><span>  Broomielaw  a  few  hours  before  high</span><span>  tide,  can  proceed  right  out  to  sea.</span></p> <p><span>  If  we  turn  to  a  consideration  of  the</span><span>  means  by  which  all  this  has  been</span><span>  accomplished,  we  find  they  are  quite</span></p> <p><span>  within  our  own  reach.  We  are  told</span></p> <p><span>  that  ""the  rapidity  of  the  deepening</span><span>  process  has  been  due  almost  entirely</span><span>  to  the  powerful  steam  dredgers</span><span>  employed  by  the  trustees,  to  the  use</span><span>  of  the  diving-bell  for  blasting  purposes,</span><span>  and  latterly  to  the  employment  of  steam</span><span>  drilling  and  dynamite.""  During  the  last</span><span>  thirty  years  twenty  millions  of  tons  of</span><span>  stuff  have  been  taken  out  of  the  river</span><span>  channel.  The  cost  of  dredging  alone  in</span><span>  the  Clyde  has  been  upwards  of  half  a</span><span>  million  pounds  sterling.  Now,  compared</span><span>  with  this  it  is  evident  all  that  has  been</span><span>  done  in  the  Fitzroy  is  mere  scratching.</span><span>  In  fact,  a  systematic  and  sustained  effort</span><span>  at  dredging  has  never  been  made  on  a</span><span>  scale  commensurate  with  the  demands</span><span>  of  the  river  and  trade.  On  the</span></p> <p><span>  Clyde,  not  one  dredge,  like  our</span><span>  coming  Saurian,  but  many  are  con-</span><span>  tinually  employed  in  deepening  the</span><span>  water  way;  and  each  is  attended</span><span>  by  a  fleet  of  steam  tugs  and  hopper</span><span>  punts,  With  such  appliances  in  active</span><span>  operation  there  is  no  reason  to  antici-</span><span>  pate  that  the  Fitzroy  may  not  be</span><span>  made  available  for  navigation  by  ocean</span><span>  ships,  and  those  steamers  the  Hon.  Mr.</span><span>  Archer  talked  about  in  his  speech  to  the</span><span>  electors  of  Blackall  District.</span></p> <p><span>  But  many  who  are  prepared  to  con-</span><span>  cede  the  possibility  of  the  improvement</span><span>  of  the  Fitzroy,  maintain  that  it  can  only</span><span>  be  effected  at  an  outlay  that  will  never</span><span>  be  recouped,  either  directly  or  indirectly</span><span>  to  the  Colony.  The  merchants  of  Glas-</span><span>  gow  had  more  faith  in  the  future  of  their'</span><span>  town  and  trade  ;  and  we  wish  the</span><span>  colonists  of  Queensland  would  only  en-</span><span>  courage  the  people  of  Rockhampton  to</span><span>  entertain  similar  feelings,  Though  the</span><span>  distance  from  Glasgow  to  deep  water  is</span><span>  only  half  that  between  Rockhampton</span><span>  and  Keppel  Bay,  the  amount  expended</span><span>  on  river  improvements  has  been  upwards</span><span>  of  seven  million  pounds  sterling.  Com-</span><span>  pare  this  with  the  peddling  outlay  of</span><span>  .five  thousand  pounds  a  year  on  the</span><span>  Fitzroy.  At  this  rate  how  long  will  it</span><span>  be  before  we  have  spent  seven  million</span><span>  pounds  on  our  river.  The  twenty-five</span><span>  thousand  pounds  we  have  still  in  hands</span><span>  of  the  last  vote  will  keep  us  going  for</span><span>  five  years.</span></p> <p><span>  Then,  again,  apart  front  the  indirect</span><span>  advantages  that  would  arise  from  the</span><span>  improvement  of  our  river  navigation,</span><span>  there  would  be  a  large  direct  revenue.</span><span>  The  present  income  is  not  taken  account</span><span>  of  :  no  record  of  it  is  kept  ;  and  the</span><span>  river  is  charged  only  with  expenditure.</span></p> <p><span>  Some  indication  of  the  increase  of</span></p> <p><span>  revenue  that  is  probable  may  be  afforded</span><span>  by  that  raised  on  the  Clyde.  Shortly</span><span>  before  the  beginning  of  the  present</span><span>  century  it  was  about  two  thousand</span><span>  pounds  per  annum  :  now  it  is  two  hun-</span><span>  dred  thousand  pounds.  Observe,  the  work</span><span>  has  been  done.  The  annual  expendi-</span><span>  ture  will  diminish  rather  than  increase  ;</span><span>  hut  the  income  will  go  on  increasing.</span><span>  Thus  old  debts  will  be  liquidated,  and</span><span>  aropie  funds  provided  for  the  erection  of</span><span>  new  docks  and  quays,  Jn  the  lighjt  of</span><span>  {these  facts,  we  may  look  with  the  utmost</span><span>  confidence  to  the  uUtrqate  results  pf  our</span><span>  river  improvements,  and  if  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  cannot,  or  will  not,  give  them  the</span><span>  attention  they  deserve,  then  our  towns-</span><span>  men  must  imitate  the  ""  Glasgow  bodies,""</span><span>  and  take  them  in  hand  themselves.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Premier  in  one  of  his  recent  speeches</span><span>  referred  to  an  anonymous  pamphlet,  which  has</span><span>  been  circulated  publicly,  on  the  Transcon-</span><span>  tinental  Railway,  and  hazarded  thc  opinion</span><span>  that  it  will  do  him  more  good  than  harm.</span><span>  Probably  it  will,  but  in  that  event  it  will  not</span><span>  serve  the  object  of  the  author.  At  Boma,</span><span>  Hon.  Mr.  Griffith,  in  order  to  discount  the</span><span>  insinuations  in  the  pamphlet,  frankly  relieved</span><span>  Sir  Thomas  M'llwraith  of  the  charge  of</span><span>  acting  from  interested  motives  in  his  railway</span><span>  schemes.  The  Courier  has  condemned  the</span></p> <p><span>  pamphlet,  and  has  shown  that  the  writer  sup-</span><span>  presses  facts  to  suit  bis  argument.

I</span><span>  read  on,  page  after  page,  and  long  ere  I  had</span><span>  reached  the  end,  I  neared  a  sigh  of  admira-</span><span>  tion.  'Great  Heavens,'  I  exclaimed,  '  What</span><span>  an  expositor  I  He  exposes,  no  doubt,  a  most</span><span>  artful  derioe,  but  he  exposes  himself.  Ho«</span><span>  sad.'

I</span><span>  looked  for  the  '  name,  for  the  names  of</span><span>  the  spéculative  ring  who  had  evidently</span><span>  inspired  this  expositor.  I  turned  it  over,</span><span>  behind  and  before,  back  side  and  front  side,</span><span>  still  no  name  I  Was  it  possible-an  utterance</span><span>  from  a  speculative  ring,  and  yet  the  ring  had</span><span>  no  name!  There  was  room  here  I  immediately</span><span>  felt  lor  further  inquiry,  I  determined  to</span><span>  probe  it  to  the  bottom.  The  funereal  pro-</span><span>  duction  was  positively  alire  with  libels.  It</span><span>  crawled  with  libels  -  artful  libols.

It  was  about  half  a  pound  in  weight</span><span>  and  beautifully  shaped.

"<p><span>  KOCK  HAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  AMONG  the  reckless  and  rash  charges,</span><span>  made  against  the  Ministry  by  the  Liberal</span><span>  Press,  is  the  statement  that,  during  their</span><span>  tenure  of  office,  they  have  not  improved</span><span>  the  legislation  of  the  colony.  With  un</span><span>  I  blushing  effrontery  it  has  been  asserted,</span></p> <p><span>  that  they  have  spent  their  energies</span><span>  and  time,  in  devising  and  developing</span><span>  heroic  schemes,  and  have  not  added  any</span><span>  useful  measures  to  the  statute  book  of</span><span>  Queensland.  Statements  of  this  kind,</span><span>  made  repeatedly,  without  regard  to</span><span>  truth,  are  intended  to  disparage  the</span><span>  Ministry,  and  if  accepted  by  credulous</span><span>  people  will  doubtless  accomplish  their</span><span>  purpose.  In  this  electorate,  we  feel  con-</span><span>  fident,  the  Ministry  will  not  be  con-</span><span>  demned  upon  the  hard  sayings  of</span><span>  political  detractors.  By  their  works</span><span>  shall  they  be  judged,  and  their  friends</span><span>  will  gladly  submit  to  their  being</span><span>  arraigned  on  such  terms.  The  defeat  of</span><span>  the  Douglas  Ministry  took  place  in</span><span>  January  1879,  and  on  the  14th  of  that</span><span>  month  the  present  Governmant  came</span><span>  toto  power.  In  that  first  session  of</span><span>  Parliament  they  passed  seventeen  public</span><span>  Acts.  Of  course  we  can  only  notice</span><span>  some  these.  The  first  measure  they</span><span>  passed  was  one  providing  that  thc</span><span>  islands  in  Torres  Straits,  between  Au-</span><span>  stralia  aDd  New  Guinea,  should  become</span><span>  part  of  the  colony  of  Queensland.</span><span>  Under  this  measure  the  boundary  line</span><span>  of  the  colony  starts  from  Sandy  Cape</span><span>  opposite  Bundaberg,  runs  north  in  a</span><span>  strait  line  to  the  21st  parallel  of  South</span><span>  Latitude,  thence  follows'the  windings  of</span><span>  the  outside  edge  of  the  Barrier  Reef,</span><span>  along  the  north  east  coast,  sweeps  close</span><span>  in  to  the  shore  of  New  Guinea,  and</span><span>  embraces  all  the  islands  in  Torres  Straits</span><span>  not  formerly  acquired  by  the  colony  in  a</span><span>  loop.  By  this  Act  the  navigable</span><span>  channel  inside  of  the  Barrier  Reef,</span><span>  was  made  British  water.  Another  of</span><span>  the  measures  passed  was  the  Electoral</span><span>  Rolls  Act,  under  which  the  quarterly</span><span>  registration  courts  are  now  held,  and</span><span>  complete  electoral  lists  are  made  up  at</span><span>  stated  periods.  An  Act  amending  the</span><span>  Crown  Lands  Alienation  Act  of  1876,</span><span>  was  passed,  which  provided  for  all</span><span>  exchanged  lands  in  the  Darling</span><span>  Downs  District  being  set  apart</span><span>  for  homestead  arcas  ;  and  increased</span><span>  the  size  of  homestead  selections</span><span>  to  160  acres.  The  Licensing  Boards</span><span>  Act  legalises  the  system  under  which</span><span>  licenses  are  granted  at  present  ;  and  the</span><span>  Divisional  Boards  Act  is  too  well  known</span><span>  to  call  for  description  or  comment.</span><span>  Among  other  acts  passed  that  session</span><span>  were  those  relating  to  the  importation</span><span>  of  mineral  oils,  to  Life  Insurance,  and</span><span>  to  Orphanages-the  establishment  of</span><span>  which  was  provided  for.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  Session  of  1880,  twenty  public</span><span>  Acts  were  passed,  the  importance  of</span><span>  which  will  appear  upon  our  adverting  to</span><span>  a  few  of  them.  Among  the  first  was  the</span><span>  Post  Card  andiostal  Note  Act,  enabling</span><span>  circulars  and  open  communications  to</span><span>  be  passed  through  the  post  at  a  low  rate  ;</span><span>  and  facilitating  the  means  by  which</span></p> <p><span>  labourers  and  working  men  may</span><span>  transmit  small  sums  of  money  to  their</span><span>  families  or  creditors  in  all  parts  of  the</span><span>  colonies.  The  Rabbit  Act  provides  means</span></p> <p><span>  to  prevent  the  colony  becoming  pestered  i</span><span>  with  these  creatures;  and  the  Duty  on</span><span>  Cedar  Act  has  gone  some  length  in  pre-</span><span>  venting  this  colony  from  being  plundered</span><span>  of  its  most  valuable  timber.  By  the</span><span>  Pacific  Island  Labourers  Aa  the  South</span><span>  Sea  Island  trade  was  placed  under</span><span>  improved  regulations,  and  provisions</span><span>  were  made  for  the  employment,  pay,  and</span><span>  humane  treatment  of  Kanakas,  In  this</span><span>  session  was  passed  the  Railway  Com-</span><span>  panies  Preliminary  Act,  providing  for</span><span>  the  construction  of  railways  by  private</span><span>  enterprise,  and  on  the  land-grant  system.</span><span>  It  was  under  this  statute  that  arrange-</span><span>  ments  were  entered  into  with  the</span></p> <p><span>  I  Warrego  Railway  Company,  and  the</span></p> <p><span>  Australian  Transcontinental  Railway</span><span>  Syndicate.  Though  the  negotiations</span><span>  with  them  have  failed,  the  Act  under</span><span>  which  they  were  made  remains,  and  it</span><span>  may  induce  future  offers  from  capitalists,</span><span>  which  the  colony  may  regard  with  some</span></p> <p><span>  favour.</span></p> <p><span>  Tho  Session  of  188  r  saw  sixteen</span><span>  public  Acts  passed.  Among  the  most</span><span>  important  of  these  was  the  Pearl  Shell</span><span>  and  Beche-de-mer  Fishery  Act,  which</span><span>  regulates  the  conduct  of  persons  engaged</span><span>  in  a  lucrative  and  important  industry,</span><span>  prosecuted  in  the  far  north  of  the  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  The  result  of  it  has  been  to  teach  lawless</span><span>  intruders  that  they  will  not  be  permitted</span><span>  to  do  just  as  they  choose  in  Queensland</span><span>  waters;  and  to  secure  protection  for</span><span>  Kanaka  and  native  labourers.  The</span><span>  Marsupials  Destruction  Act  has  been</span><span>  recognised  as  a  most  useful  measure  ;</span><span>  and  from  the  report  of  the  Inspector  of</span><span>  Mines,  a  summary  of  which  wc  pub-</span><span>  lished  the  other  day,  it  would  be</span><span>  observed  that  the  Mines  Regulation  Act,</span><span>  in  the  first  year  of  its  operations,  has</span><span>  been  the  means  of  diminishing  accidents</span><span>  about  one-half.  The,Fire  Brigades  Act</span><span>  repealed  an  unworkable  measure,  and</span><span>  gave  us  a  useful  one  instead,  under</span><span>  which  ample  provisions  may  be  made  for</span><span>  safeguarding  our  houses  and  streets  from</span><span>  conflagrations.  In  the  Sale  of  Foods  and</span><span>  Drugs  Act,  provision  has  been  made  for</span><span>  the  punishment  of  those  who  mix  in-</span><span>  gredients  injurious  to  the  health  with  food.</span><span>  Convictions  under  the  Act  have  already</span><span>  taken  place,  and  its  presence  on  the</span><span>  Statute  Book  will,  no  doubt,  have  an  ex-</span><span>  cellent  effect  in  deterring  thc  practices  of</span><span>  those  who  would  vend  ""  doctored  tea  ""</span><span>  and  watered  milk.  The  United  Munici-</span><span>  palities  Act  was  a  corollary  and  valuable</span><span>  supplement  to  the  Divisional  Boards</span></p> <p><span>  Act.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  Session  of  1882  seventeen</span></p> <p><span>  Acts  were  passed.  The  most  important</span><span>  of  these  was  the  Immigration  Act.</span><span>  Under  it  favourable  terms  are  offered  to</span></p> <p><span>  intending  emigrants  from  the  United</span><span>  Kingdom;  the  Agent-General  is  em-</span><span>  powered  to  assist  them  to  the  port  of</span><span>  embarkation  ;  and  provision  is  made  for</span><span>  punishing  them  if  they  attempt  to  leave</span><span>  this  colony  immediately  after  landing.</span><span>  In  The  Tramways  Act  legislative  sanc-</span><span>  tion  has  been  given  to  the  construction</span><span>  of  these  aids  to  locomotion,  either  by</span><span>  Municipal  Corporations  or  private  com-</span><span>  panies.  The  Settled  District  Pastoral</span><span>  leases  upon  terms  fixed  by  appraisement,</span><span>  and  recognises  the  right  of  tenants  to</span><span>  consideration  for  their  improvements.</span><span>  The  Indian  Immigration  Act  Amend-</span><span>  ment  Act,  provides  that  no  regulations</span><span>  relating  to  the  introduction  of  Coolies,</span><span>  shall  have  the  force  of  law  till  approved</span><span>  of  by  both  Houses  of  Parliament.</span></p> <p><span>  Among  measures,  which  have  been</span><span>  introduced  and  discussed  at  some  length,</span><span>  have  been  the  Insanity  Bill,  and  Liquor</span><span>  Retailers  Licensing  Bill.  These  would</span><span>  have  been  placed  upon  the  Statute  Book</span><span>  this  session,  had  the  business  been</span><span>  carried  on  by  the  present  Government.</span><span>  In  condemning  the  Ministry  for  not</span><span>  passing  measures  of  public  importance,</span><span>  the  Liberal  critics  forget  that  the</span><span>  Opposition  have  done  nothing  to</span><span>  stimulate  useful  legislation.  If  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Griffith  and  his  friends  saw  that</span></p> <p><span>  certain  legislation  was  urgently  required,</span><span>  it  was  within  their  province  to  have  intro-</span><span>  duced  the  necessary  measures  ;  but  they</span><span>  utterly  failed  to  do  so.  Mr.  M'Lean</span><span>  introduced  his  Permissive  Prohibition  of</span><span>  Sales  of  Intoxicating  Liquors  Bili  in</span><span>  1869,  when  it  was  rejected  on  the  second</span><span>  reading.  Tile  Triennial  Parliaments</span><span>  Bill  introduced  by  Mr.  Griffith  in  1880,</span><span>  shared  asimilar  fate,  and  was  introduced</span><span>  hut  was  not  persevered  will)  in  1S82.</span><span>  The  same  gentleman  got  a  Pharmacy</span><span>  Bill  through  the  Assembly,  bul  it  was</span></p> <p><span>  never  returned  from  the  Council.  His</span></p> <p><span>  Bill  to  repeal  the  Indian  Immigration</span><span>  Act  was  defeated.

"<p><span>  TO  THE  EDITOR  OF  THE  M0RK1ÜO  BULLETIN.</span></p> <p><span>  Sin,-I  am  of  opinion  that  tho  platform</span><span>  nttcranoca  of  tho  Rev.  Colin  M'Culfock  at  tho</span></p> <p><span>  meeting  on  Tuesday  cvoning,  as  reported  in</span><span>  this  morning's  Pulktin,  should  not  be  per-</span><span>  mitted  to  pass  unnoticed.  I  have  always  held</span><span>  that  tho  highest  type  cf  man  is  a  Christian,</span><span>  and  n«  such-no  matter  how  poor,  invariably</span><span>  a  gentleman.  I  leave  it  to  the  calm  and  un-</span><span>  biased  decision  of  your  readers,  whether  it</span><span>  was  Christian-whether  it  was  tho  act  of  a</span><span>  gontleman-of  a  Christian  minister,  to  oller</span><span>  such  a  gratuitous  insult  to  the  Protestant</span><span>  ministers  nf  this  town,  as  to  convey  the  im-</span><span>  pression  that  they  were  a  parcel  of  illiterate</span><span>  tailors  with  black  ooats  and  ""  white  chokers  ""</span><span>  and  whose  pulpit  efforts  were  ""  sound  without</span><span>  sense.""  It  is  well  known  that  each  of  the</span><span>  denominations  referred  to  possess  oollogcs  and</span><span>  theological  institutes  for  training  their  minis-</span><span>  ters,  ss  well  as  the  Presbyterians  ;  that  many  ot</span><span>  thoir  clergy  are  hoad  ana  shoulders  above  tho</span><span>  Bcv.  Colin  M'Culloch,  eitheras  pulpit  orators,</span><span>  platform  speakers,  or  publio  lecturers  on</span><span>  soienoe  or  religion  ;  and  not  only  this,  but</span><span>  they  are  doing  a  work  in  bringing  the  Gospel</span><span>  to  tho  poor,  in  elevating  the  manes,  in</span><span>  rescuing  the  perishing  which  the  Kev.  Colin</span><span>  M'Cullooh  and  his  learned  brethren  do  not</span><span>  attempt.  It  is,not  at  any  rate  a  line  gua  non</span><span>  with  the  Methodists  in  their  abundant</span><span>  evangelical  labours,  either  among  the  masses</span><span>  in  tho  large  centres  of  population  in  the  distant</span><span>  bush,  or  on  the  outposts  of  civilisation  that  the</span><span>  money  question  should  be  a  first  primary</span><span>  consideration,  hut  tbe  love  of  Christ  constrains</span><span>  them.  Mr.  M'Culloch  complains  that  Presby-</span><span>  terians  are  tn  he  fnnnd  in  tho  congregations  of</span><span>  Primitive  Methodist,  Wesleyan,  and  Congre-</span><span>  gational  Churches;  but  he  ignores  tho  fant</span><span>  that  not  only  in  Rockhampton,  but  in  all  parts</span><span>  of  thocolony,  reprosentativesofthesedenomina</span><span>  tions  are  found  in  almost  every  Presbyterian</span><span>  congregation  in  tho  land,  and  their  ministers</span><span>  in  outsido  places  especially  aro  largely  sup-</span><span>  ported  by  other  than  Presbyterians.  It  is</span><span>  not  croditabto  to  Presbyterianism,  and  to  its</span></p> <p><span>  much  vaunted  learned  ministry,  that</span><span>  the  ranks  of  infidelity  should  ho  so  largely</span><span>  recruited  from  adherents  of  that  Church  ;</span><span>  and  it  would  appear  from  the  utterances</span><span>  of  the  Ber.  Colin  M'Cullooh  that  the  minis-</span><span>  ters  about  to  be  introduoed  into  Queensland</span><span>  are  to  be  raen  trained  Bpocially  for  the  work</span><span>  of  bringing  back  these  infidel  wanderers  to  the</span><span>  fold  of  Presbyterianism.  Sydney  Smith  in</span><span>  his  day  wrote  eomo  pungent  squibs  about</span><span>  Carey,  the  missionary  to  India,  This  witty</span><span>  clergyman  referred  to  Carey  as  ""  tho  eonsc</span><span>  I  crated  cobbler,""  but  Carey  laid  tho  foundation</span></p> <p><span>  of  a  work  in  India  which  shall  exist  when</span><span>  Sydney  Smith  and  his  criticisms  are  forgotten</span><span>  and  buried  in  the  dust  of  ages.  Livingstone,</span><span>  thc  factory  boy,  became  tho  successful  mis-</span><span>  sionary,  another  renowned  traveller  and</span><span>  explorer  of  Central  Africa.  Robert  Moffatt,</span><span>  the  gardener's  boy,  became  tho  apostle  of</span><span>  Africa.  It  is  a  well-known  fact  that  the</span><span>  divinity  students  of  the  Church  of  Scotland</span><span>  are  not  ns  a  rule  recruited  from  the  laird's</span><span>  mansion,  but  from  thc  shepherds  sheding  on</span><span>  the  monutain  side,  and  from  the  plough  tail,</span><span>  from  tho  workshop  and  the  counter  nil  honor</span><span>  to  tho  lads,  if  they  possess  the  necessary</span><span>  qualifications,  which  were  imparted  to  the</span><span>  hVlicrinen  of  Galilee  and  to  Paul  tho  apostle,</span><span>  another  tent-maker.

"<p><span>  TO  TUE  EDITOR  OF  THE  MORNING  BULLETIN.</span></p> <p><span>  SIR,-I  am  glad  that  ""  Mercator  ""  is  of  the</span><span>  earoo  opiniou  as  myself  concerning  the  money</span><span>  spent  for  the  education  of  the  masses.  At  the</span><span>  same  time  lam  sorry  my  letter  led  ""Mercator""</span><span>  to  think  I  sneered  at  the  employment  of  lads</span></p> <p><span>  in  mercantile  establishments.  I  donot  for  one</span><span>  moment  think  commercial  life  infradignitatem.</span><span>  A  large  number  of  people  in  any  city  must,</span><span>  from  the  naturo  of  things,  give  their  time  and</span><span>  abilities  to  commerce  ;  and  as  the  old  pass</span><span>  away,  the  young  occupy  their  places.  And</span><span>  where  are  these  youths  to  come  from  (in  this</span><span>  town)  if  not  from  ""Our  Public  Schools.""  It</span><span>  is  commerce  that  has  made  thc  British  Empire</span><span>  BO  famous,  and  I  should  be  miserably  mean</span><span>  wcro  I  purposely  to  sneer  at  those  who</span><span>  honourably  follow  such  pursuits.</span></p> <p><span>  Since  ""  Mercator  ""  asserts  he  had  ""  pounds</span><span>  in  a  bushel  of  corn  ""  in  his  manuscript,  I  with-</span><span>  draw  my  criticism  upon  thc  ""calico  and  corn.""</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  State  Schools  of  Queensland  special</span><span>  attention  is  devoted  to  ""head  work,""  and</span><span>  more  time  given  to  theory  than  to  practice.  I</span><span>  believe  there  are  no  technical  schools  in  this</span><span>  colony,  and  that  the  Government  is  un-</span><span>  willing  to  spend  extra  money  to.  supply</span></p> <p><span>  a  staff  of  mechanics  to  teach  thc  various</span></p> <p><span>  trades.  For  my  own  part  thc  desirability  of</span><span>  having  at  least  one  such  institution  in  each</span><span>  of  the  larger  towns.  Were  ""  Mercator  ""  to</span><span>  state  that  many  of  the  teachers  do  not  know</span><span>  how  roany  pounds  are  contained  in  a  bushel  I</span><span>  should  not  bc  surprised,  but  most  boys,  from</span><span>  tho  middle  forms  upwards,  have  learned  at</span><span>  eomc  time  or  other  that  SS  lbs.  make  a</span><span>  bushol.  In  all  probability  moll}'  of  them  tn</span><span>  thc  course  of  a  short  lime  would  forget  this</span><span>  fact  ;  but  any  small  boy  who  has  weighed  out</span><span>  50  lbs.,  or  a  bushel  of  maize,  a  few  times,  will</span><span>  most  likely  remember  it  as  long  ns  he  lives.</span><span>  Here  bead  and  hand  work  together  ;  herc</span><span>  theory  and  practice  are  combined.  All  tho</span><span>  pupils  of  Bny  school  would  know  the  ""arith-</span><span>  metical  tables  ""  much  better  if  thc  authorities</span><span>  were  to  supply  scales,  weights,  and  a  collec-</span><span>  tion  of  general  merchandise  amongst  tho  school</span><span>  requisites.  This  is  not  done  iu  a  single  school</span></p> <p><span>  in  tho  world,  so  it  remains  for  teachers  to</span><span>  inculcate  the  theory,  and  for  ""Mercator""  to</span><span>  show  some  of  our  youths  how  to  turn  that</span><span>  instruction  to  practical  use.  I  find  my  idea</span><span>  on  teaching  tables  in  such  a  manner  supported</span><span>  by  a  well-known  English  writer  on  education,</span><span>  who  says  ""For  which  purpose  it  is  obvious</span><span>  that  the  teachers  should  have  all  the  weights</span><span>  and  measures  of  the  country,  and  duplicates</span><span>  of  many  of  them,  amongst  his  apparatus.""  I</span><span>  suppose  arithmetic  is  one  of  the  principal</span><span>  subjects  of  the  State  Schools  which  receive  a</span><span>  fair  portion  of  time.  The  examinations</span><span>  teachers  arc  compelled  to  pass  are  a  sufficient</span><span>  guarantee  that  their  knowledge  of  that  subject</span><span>  at  least,  is  by  no  means  below  the  standard.</span><span>  Now,  if  a  boy  who  has  regularly  attended</span><span>  school  till  he  is  fourteen  years  of  age  does  not</span><span>  know  enough  arithmetic  ta  answer  questions</span><span>  such  as  those  propounded  by  ""  Mercator,""  the</span><span>  fault  lies  not  with  the  teacher,  nor  tho</span><span>  Educational  Department,  but  with  thc  boy,</span><span>  who  has  no  aptitude  for  mathematics,  how-</span><span>  ever  elementary.  If  parents'  means  are  ade-</span><span>  quate  they  should  not  withdraw  children</span><span>  under  fourteen  years  of  agc  from  school.  If  I</span><span>  mistake  not,  this  is  the  agc  stated  in  the  so</span><span>  called  Compulsory  Act.  Then,  if  a  youth  who</span><span>  has  not  reached  that  age  seek  a  position  in</span><span>  business,  and,  being  tried  in  the  balance,  is</span><span>  found  wanting,  it  is  rather  unfair  to  attach  all</span></p> <p><span>  tho  blaine  to  the  State  Schools  for  his</span></p> <p><span>  ignorance.  At  the  same  time  a  public</span></p> <p><span>  criticism  will  do  no  barm  to  thc  schools  if  it</span><span>  bo  carried  on  with  moderation.  I  would</span><span>  inform  ""  Mercator""  that  I  am  uot  unaware  of</span><span>  tho  fact  that  ""  not  a  few  employes,  &c,""  com-</span><span>  menced  business  as  cashiers,  or  errand  boys.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  Mercator  ""  presumes  I  am  a  teacher  be-</span><span>  cause  I  reply  to  him  on  ""Our  l'ublic</span><span>  Schools  ;""  be  might  just  as  well  say  that  I</span><span>  was  a  mesmerist  seeing  that  I  replied  to</span><span>  Professor  Armand  that  ""  too  awfully  utter  ""</span><span>  exponent  of  that  art.

"<p><span>  I  TO  THE  EDITOR  OP  THE  MORNING  BULLETIN.</span></p> <p><span>  Sir,-Por  some  years  I  havo  toen</span><span>  acquainted  with  tho  Hov.  C,  M'Cultoch,  of</span><span>  linsbano,  and  have  always  regarded  him  as  a</span><span>  minister  whose  chris  tain  charity  rendered</span><span>  him  superior  to  the  more  restrictions</span><span>  of  denormnationaUsm  and  that  good,  whether</span><span>  formed  in  the  Uglier  ranks  of  Presbyterianism</span><span>  loading  public  opinion,  or  in  thc  denominations</span><span>  about  which  he  speaks  so  disparagingly,</span><span>  would  command  the  rcspcot  and  admiration</span><span>  of  his  generous  nature.  After  reading  his</span><span>  speech  in  this  morning's  Bulletin  L  with  many</span><span>  othors,  must  come  to  tho  conclusion  that  wo</span><span>  have,  not  only  not  correctly  known  Mr.</span><span>  M'Culloch,  but  have  been  in  great  ignorance  of</span><span>  his  real  attitude  toward  the  Churches  of  this</span><span>  oolony.  I  have  read  many  addresses  from  men</span><span>  who  wore  proverbially  exclusive,  but  I  do  sot</span><span>  remember  to  have  read  anything  eo  extremely</span><span>  narrow  and  uncharitable  as  the  addroBS  re-</span><span>  ferred  to,  If  Hit.  M'Cullqph  cannot  agree</span><span>  with  tho  methods  adopted  in  other  Churches,</span><span>  ho  might  quietly  pass  them  by,  or  if  he  feols</span><span>  bound  to  eriticise  their  doings,  he  should  do  it</span><span>  fairly,  in  the  right  place  and,  at  the  proper</span><span>  time.  I  submit  that  the  references  made  by</span><span>  him  to  other  denominations  in  Presbyterian</span><span>  Church  on  Tuesday  evening  before  a  pro-</span><span>  miscuous  congregation  were  not  correct,  un-</span><span>  less  the  exception  rather  than  the  rule  is  to</span><span>  govern.  Mr.  M'Culloch  seems  to  overlook  tho</span><span>  fact  thst  men  of  humble  birth  may  oarry  the</span><span>  light  of  the  Reformation  In  their  hearts,  rise</span><span>  to  the  highest  spheres  of  usefulness,  and</span></p> <p><span>  wield  an  influence  over  their  fellows</span><span>  that  shall  tell  upon  their  best  interests  for</span><span>  ever.  Tho  groat  Master  himself  was  lowly  in</span><span>  birth,  and  some  of  his  apostles  were  fisher-</span><span>  men.  Many  of  tho  more  able  and  useful</span><span>  men  is  later.ages  wera  made  famous,  not</span><span>  because  of  their  parentage,  plaoo  of  birth,  or</span><span>  early  advantages.

The  way  I  have  got  rid  of  them  for</span><span>  several  years  past  is  very  simple.  I  take  a</span><span>  light  polo  twenty  to  thirty  feet  long,  and</span><span>  fasten  eight  or  more  fine  wires  to  the  top  of</span><span>  it  ;  erect  the  poles  ovor  whero  the  fruit  is  that</span><span>  requires  protecting,  and  then  take  these</span></p> <p><span>  several  wires  in  various  directions  round  about</span><span>  the  pole  and  fasteu  them  to  stakes  or  trees  as</span><span>  may  bc  moBt  convenient.  They  should  not  be</span><span>  tight,  as  when  so  they  are  more  readily  broken</span><span>  by  the  foxes  flying  against  them.  Brass  or</span><span>  copper  wire,  2i  to  20  gauge,  will  answer  the</span><span>  purpose.  It  will  probabably  break  when</span><span>  struck  in  full  force,  but  if  so  the  flying  fox,</span><span>  will  not  be  inclined  to  repeat  the  experiment.</span></p> <p><span>  CHRISTMAS  IN  MELBOURNE.-Tuesday  was</span><span>  observed  as  a  general  holiday.  A  great</span><span>  variety  of  amusements  were  provided  for  tho</span><span>  public,  all  of  which  received  a  full  share  of</span><span>  patronage.  The  Intercolonial  Cricket  Match</span><span>  attracted  many  thousands  of  persona,  and  the</span><span>  V.A.T.C.  Summer  Meeting  at  Caulfield  was</span><span>  very  fairly  attended,  despite  the  inadequate</span><span>  provision  of  the  Railway  Department  for  con-</span><span>  veying  visitors  to  the  course,  The  Tem-</span><span>  perance  Gala  was  attended  by  fully  23,000</span><span>  people.  The  trains  running  to  various  holiday</span><span>  resorts  were  crowded,  and  thc  resources  of  thc</span><span>  Department  were  altogether  too  limited  to</span></p> <p><span>  meet  the  demands.  The  usual  marine  excur-</span><span>  sions,  in  which,  in  addition  to  the  ordinary</span><span>  excursion  steamers,  several  intercolonial</span><span>  traders  were  engaged,  were  all  highly  success-</span><span>  ful.  In  the  evening  the  various  theatres  and</span><span>  other  places  of  amusement  were  largely</span><span>  attended.  The  Theatre  Royal,  where  the</span><span>  pantomime  season  was  opened,  was  packed  to</span><span>  such  no  extent  as  to  cause  considerable  dis-</span><span>  comfort  to  thc  audience,  and  some  disorder</span><span>  ensued  in  consequence.  The  Opera  House,</span><span>  Bijou  Theatre,  and  Princess  were  all  well</span><span>  patronised,  and  at  the  musical  festival  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  Exhibition  there  was  au  immense  audience.</span></p> <p><span>  This  morning  thc  third  concert  of  the  festival</span><span>  was  given.

"<p><span>  KOCK  ll  A  MITON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY.  FiîBRUAllY  19,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  dangers  to  which  the  colonists  of</span><span>  Australia  are  exposed  from  the  influx  of</span><span>  Chinese  has  been  again  prominently</span><span>  brought  under  notice  by  the  arrival  in</span><span>  Port  Jackson  of  the  Menmuir,  s.s.,  with</span><span>  sixty  Mongolians  for  New  South  Wales</span><span>  and  ninety  for  Queensland.  These</span><span>  objectionable  immigrants  have  small-pox</span><span>  among  them,  and  thc  necessity  for  the</span><span>  utmost  care  being  taken  to  prevent  this</span><span>  disease  being  spread  by  the  Chinese,</span><span>  puts  tile  Government  of  the  sister  colony</span><span>  to  great  expense.  lt  will  be  very</span><span>  apparent  that  under  existing  regulations</span><span>  these  orientals  will  continue  to  emigrate</span><span>  from  their  own  country  into  ours,  and  it</span><span>  is  very  extraordinary,  after  all  the  evi-</span><span>  dence  that  has  been  brought  forward</span><span>  from  time  to  time,  to  show  how  objec-</span><span>  tionable  the  Chinese  are  in  any  country</span><span>  inhabited  by  Europeans,  that  still  legis-</span><span>  lature  docs  not  grapple  with  the  evil  and</span><span>  remedy  it.  It  is  remarkable  lo  observe</span><span>  also  how  those  disinterested  patriots,</span><span>  wbo  so  loudly  proclaim  their  intention  of</span><span>  keeping  Queensland  for  the  white  man</span><span>  whatever  that  may  mean-we  say  it  is  very</span><span>  remarkable  lu  observe  these  philan-</span><span>  thropic  individuals  who  love  thc  while</span><span>  man  and  the  black  (in  his  proper  place)</span><span>  -employing  the  latter  when  it  suits</span><span>  their  own  convenience.  How  pleasant</span><span>  it  is  to  contemplate  the  sauve  and  pious</span><span>  Mr.  Brookes,  who  is  thc  antagonist  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  labour  traffic  which  he  speaks  of  as  the</span><span>  slave  trade,  himself  superintending</span><span>  Kanakas  and  Chinamen  cultivating  his</span><span>  own  garden.  It  is  simply  because  there</span><span>  are  so  many  men  who  profess  themselves</span><span>  anxious  to  protect  the  country,  and  yet</span><span>  are  wanting  in  sincerity,  that  we  are  still</span></p> <p><span>  liable  to  tile  introduction  of  foul  diseases</span><span>  from  mongolian  races.  These  men  who</span><span>  so  loudly  protest  against  the  introduction</span><span>  of  Coolies  into  this  country  under  pro-</span><span>  per  restrictive  regulations,  are  the  very</span><span>  ones  who  would  leave  the  portals  open</span><span>  for  a  race  infinitely  more  objectionable,</span><span>  less  useful,  and,  from  a  sanitary  point  of</span><span>  view,  absolutely  dangerous.  These  very</span><span>  men  who  proclaim  against  the  Coolie</span><span>  and  the  Cingalese,  actually  themselves</span><span>  employ  Chinese  labour;'  and  even  go  so</span><span>  far  as  to  say  that  there  is  no  necessity  to</span><span>  import  Coolies,  for  Chinamen  can.  work</span><span>  on  the  sugar  plantations.  Looking  at  the</span><span>  labour  question  fairly,  it  will  surely  be</span><span>  apparent  that  Chinese  immigrants  are</span><span>  dangerous  to  the  white  tradesmen,  but</span><span>  the  Coolie  is  not.  The  one  competes</span><span>  with  the  whites  as  a  cabinet-maker</span><span>  and  storekeeper,  and  as  an  agriculturalist;</span><span>  whereas  the  other  has  no  aspirations</span><span>  beyond  a  sufficiency  of  rice  and  moderate</span><span>  wages.  Vet  we  find  that  the  very  men</span><span>  who  are  horrified  at  Coolies  being  brought</span><span>  here,  who  cry  out  that  the  white  man's</span><span>  wages  will  be  endangered,  never  do  any</span><span>  practical  good  towards  saving  him  from</span><span>  Chinese.  Surely,  if  these  gentlemen</span><span>  were  sincere-surely  if  they  were  so</span><span>  tender-hearted  towards  the  working  man</span><span>  for  whose  vote  they  are  fishing-they</span><span>  would  long  since  have  protected  him.</span><span>  from  the  real  evil  in  preference  to  assail-</span><span>  ing  an  imaginary  one.</span></p> <p><span>  It  will  be  seen  that  the  only  way  to</span><span>  effectively  restrict  Chinese  immigration,</span></p> <p><span>  is  for  the  Governments  of  the  various</span><span>  colonies  to  take  united  action.  It  is  no</span><span>  use  for  one  colony  to  institute  restrictive</span><span>  measures  if  the  others  do  not,  for  these</span><span>  people  could  come  to  the  open  colony</span><span>  first,  and  then  make  their  way  into  the</span><span>  closed  ones.  Whether  we  have  the</span><span>  power  to  exclude  Chinese  or  not  has</span><span>  been  considered  at  some  length  by  the</span><span>  legislative  bodies  of  the  various  colonies,</span><span>  and  it  has  been  pointed  out  that  Hong-</span><span>  kong,  being  a  British  colony,  we  cannot</span><span>  legally  refuse  admission  to  Her  Majesty's</span><span>  subjects  coming  from  that  portion  of  her</span><span>  dominions,  even  if  they  are  the  almond</span><span>  eyed  sons  of  the  East.  But  it  must  be</span><span>  remembered  that  the  mere  fact  of  resi-</span><span>  dence  in  a  British  colony  for  a  lengthened</span><span>  period  does  not  constitute  a  British</span><span>  subject,  and  whichever  way  the  question</span><span>  is  viewed,  it  seems  ludicrous  to  ever</span><span>  consider  a  Mongolian  as  an  English-</span><span>  man-naturalised  or  not.  Besides,  if</span><span>  England  did  force  admission  into  China,</span><span>  and  established  a  colony  there,  it  is</span><span>  rather  hard  that  we  should  have  to</span><span>  suffer.  Whether  England  was  right  or</span><span>  wrong  in  her  action  towards  China  is</span><span>  not  the  fault  of  the  colonies,  and  there</span><span>  must  be  some  way  to  protect  ourselves</span><span>  from  the  evils  of  Chinese  immigration.</span></p> <p><span>  Not  only  has  the  case  of  small-pox</span><span>  alluded  to  above  drawn  attention  to  this</span><span>  serious  subject,  but  locally  there  is  not</span><span>  wanting  proof  of  the  objectionable</span><span>  character  of  Chinese  residents.  In</span></p> <p><span>  I  several  localities  in  Rockhampton  there</span></p> <p><span>  are  celestial  dens  that  are  highly</span><span>  objectionable.  In  the  first  place</span><span>  gambling  goes  on  within  them  almost</span><span>  every  night,  and  during  nearly  the  whole</span><span>  of  Sunday;  and  not  infrequently  other</span><span>  evils  are  germinated  here  to  which  even</span><span>  the  mildest  reference  cannot  be  made  in</span><span>  public  print.  The  premises  where  these</span><span>  proceedings  to  which  we  refer  are  carried</span><span>  on  are  in  every  instance  filthy  beyond</span><span>  description,  and  the  stench  proceeding</span><span>  from  them  is  pestiferous  to  a  degree.</span><span>  Whether  the  Inspector  of  Nuisances  (if</span><span>  there  really  is  such  a  person,  and  it</span><span>  begins  to  be  a  matter  of  doubt)  could</span><span>  take  action  against  the  occupiers  of  these</span><span>  abominable  tenements  or  not.  it  is  impos-</span><span>  sible  to  say,  as  the  duties  of  that</span><span>  officer  never  seem  to  be  tested,  but</span><span>  certainly  the  police  might  be  expected  to</span><span>  to  proceed  against  them  under  the</span><span>  Vagrant  Act.  This  glorious  act  will  fit</span><span>  them  or  anyone  else,  and  why  is  it  not</span><span>  set  in  motion.  15  Vic.  No.  4  section</span><span>  3  describes  a  vagrant  as  being  a  person</span><span>  found  playing  or  betting  at  any  unlawful</span><span>  game  at  or  with  any  table  or  instrument</span><span>  of  gaming,  and  section  13  of  the  same</span><span>  Act  goes  on  to  give  justices  of  the  peace</span><span>  power  to  grant  search  warrants  for  sus-</span><span>  pected  persons-that  is  suspected  oí</span><span>  vagrancy  in  lodging  houses.  There  is</span><span>  thus  clearly  a  way  for  the  police  to  reach</span><span>  these  Chinese  gamblers,  and  rid  us  of</span><span>  their  dens,  since  all  these  Chinese</span><span>  tenements  are  lodging  houses.  If</span><span>  there  be  a  difficulty  in  obtaining</span><span>  evidence  as  to  the  actual  game</span><span>  played,  surely  the  production  of  the</span><span>  instruments  of  gaming,  and  the  money</span><span>  that  at  any  lime  could  be  seized  on  the</span><span>  table,  is  prima  fade  evidence  ol</span><span>  gambling,  and  more  especially  would  it</span><span>  be  sufficient,  if  evidence  were  produced</span><span>  of  the  fact  that  money  changed  hands  in</span><span>  accordance  with  some  rule  of  the  table.</span></p> <p><span>  It  appears  to  us  that  this  Chinese</span><span>  Question  has  been  allowed  to  sleep  toa</span><span>  long,  and  remains  still  in  far  too  unsatis-</span><span>  factory  a  condition.  Herc  we  are  allow-</span><span>  ing  the  ingress  of  a  horde  of  the  most</span><span>  most  objectionable  race,  while  in  all</span><span>  directions  is  observable  agitation</span><span>  about  a  much  less  dangerous  immigrant.</span><span>  Sand  is  clearly  being  thrown  into  the</span><span>  eyes  of  the  electors  over  the  Coolie</span><span>  Question,  and  surely  the  bona  fides  ol</span><span>  thc  anti-Coolie  legislators  should  be</span><span>  questioned  when  they  are  supine  about</span><span>  Chinese.  The  evils  of  the  Mongolian</span><span>  immigration  are  apparent  and  unmistak-</span><span>  able.  Their  arrival  endangers  the  health  oí</span><span>  our  communities,  their  presence  under-</span><span>  mines  the  morality  of  the  lower  classes,</span><span>  and  while  they  contribute  a  mere  nothing</span><span>  to  the  taxes  of  the  country,  they  from</span><span>  lime  to  time  export  the  results  of  theil</span><span>  labour  to  their  own  country.  They  dc</span><span>  nothing  to  circulate  money  in  oui</span><span>  country,  and  are  a  race  calculated  only</span><span>  to  reduce  the  wages,  more  especially  ol</span><span>  agriculturalists,  mitlers,  and  domestic  ser-</span><span>  vants.  Here  is  a  real  and  palpable</span><span>  evil-an  evil  long  recognised,  and  not</span><span>  yet  remedied,  even  though  there</span><span>  are  men  in  the  Legislature  whe</span></p> <p><span>  profess  a  determination  to  stand  hand</span><span>  to  band  and  shoulder  to  shoulder  in  the</span><span>  interests  of  the  working  man.  When</span><span>  we  see  Chinese  still  swarming  into  our</span><span>  country,  when  we  see  the  squatter's</span><span>  claims  to  cheap  labour  so  cordially</span><span>  acknowledged  by  the  friends  ot  the</span><span>  working  man,  we  are  inclined  to</span><span>  wonder  what,  the  working  man  is  like,</span><span>  when  his  representatives  rate  his  per-</span><span>  ceptions  at  so  low  a  valuation.</span></p> <p><span>  UNQUESTIONABLY  the  trade  of  this  port  is</span><span>  out-growiug  the  accommodation  of  our  wharves,</span><span>  for  at  the  present  time  large  quantities  of</span><span>  goods  ready  to  bo  landed,  are  lying  ia  punts</span><span>  on  the  far  aide  of  the  ships  already  berthed,</span><span>  awaiting  an  opportunity  to  be  discharged.</span></p> <p><span>  How  Messrs.  W.  Howard  Smith  and  Go.  are</span><span>  to  find  berths  for  their  steamers  ia  a  rather</span><span>  difficult  problem-every  available  foot  of  the</span><span>  corporation  wharf  being  occupied.  But  while</span><span>  our  oivio  authorities  slowly  realise  the  neces-</span><span>  sity  for  action  in  the  direotion  indicated,  there</span><span>  ¡8  surely  no  good  and  euffioient  reason  why  the</span><span>  wharveB.  as  they  now  are,  should  not  be  pro-</span><span>  perly  supervised.  There  is  no  regular  wharfin-</span><span>  ger  on  the  Corporation  wharf,  and  vessels</span><span>  appear  to  berth  themselves  almoBt  according</span><span>  to  their  own  sweet  will.  The  Town  Clerk</span><span>  hos  oontrol,  we  believe,  of  the  wharves,</span><span>  but  unmistakably  he  cannot  be  in  attendance,</span><span>  and  it  is  sometimes  very  diffioult  to  find</span><span>  him,  as  he  i>  about  in  all  directions</span><span>  attending  to  his  various  duties.  Thus/  it</span><span>  will  be  seen  that  delay  and  inconvenience</span><span>  must  frequently  occur  in  connection  with  the</span><span>  shipping.  Tho  goods  now  lying  on  the  wharf</span><span>  are  of  almost  every  description,  and  are  piled</span><span>  up  in  a  formidable  mountain  extending  almost</span><span>  the  entire  length  of  the  wharf,  causing  we</span><span>  understand  considerable  inconvenience  at</span><span>  times  to  consignees,  who  find  it  difficult  to</span><span>  ascertain  the  whereabouts  ot  their  goods;</span><span>  This  matter  of  the  necessity  of  increased</span><span>  wharfage  accommodation  has  been  so  re-</span><span>  peatedly  brought  before  the  notice  of  the</span><span>  Municipal  Council,  as  also  the  matter  of  the</span><span>  desirability  of  appointing  a  wharfinger,  that</span><span>  it  becomes  almost  tedious  to  refer  again  to  it.</span><span>  Numerous  complaints  have  been  made,  and</span><span>  accidents  have  occurred  through  there  being</span><span>  no  responsible  corporation  officer  on  our  public</span><span>  wharf,  but  not  even  loss  of  life  disturbs  the</span><span>  placid  self-satisfaction  of  Aldermen,  who</span></p> <p><span>  know  they  have  merited  the  respeot  and  sup-</span><span>  port  of  tho  ratepayers,  because  their  elections</span><span>  were  unopposed.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  have  received  from  the  publishers,</span><span>  Messrs.

One  of  the  most  remarkable</span></p> <p><span>  features  of  this  publication  is  its  seeming</span><span>  favour  with  the  advertisingpublio,  there  being</span><span>  thirty-two  pases  of  advertisements  to  twenty</span><span>  pages  of  reading  matter.  The  Minister  for</span><span>  Lands,  Mr.  Perkins,  also  seems  to  consider  it</span><span>  a  valuable  advertising  medium.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  Mr.  Pagh'u  time  as  Magistrate  here  a</span><span>  South  Sea  Islander  was  sent  to  gaol  on  several</span><span>  charges.  For  some  he  was  6  ned,  and  having</span><span>  paid  the  fines  he  could  not  understand  why  he</span><span>  was  kept  in  gaol  on  a  charge  for  which  no  fine</span><span>  was  imposed.  On  being  liberated  he  received</span><span>  the  bilanoo  due  to  him  out  of  the  funds  he</span><span>  had  when  arrested,  He  evidently  brooded</span><span>  over  the  subject  and  went  to  the  look-up</span><span>  yeBterdayafternoontoaskfortheSergeant.

About  eleven  o'clock  Wilson  missed</span><span>  thc  bag,  and  also  one  of  the  occupants  of  the</span><span>  room  who  had  been  most  assiduous  in  his</span><span>  attentions  to  him.

A</span><span>  beginning,  too,  might  bc  made  by  the  men  of</span><span>  influence  in  our  city  for  the  establishment  of  a</span><span>  free  public  library.  In  this,  and  in  other</span><span>  similar  ways,  thc  objection  that  short  hours</span><span>  for  certain  classes  mcau  only  an  easy  road  tn</span><span>  evil  habits  and  profligacy  will  be  met,  and</span><span>  mcu  who  now  staud  aloof  from  the  early</span><span>  closing  movemeut,  seeing  it  allied  with</span><span>  opportunities  for  moral  «nd  mental  elevation,</span><span>  will  heartily  yield  their  sympathy  and  give</span><span>  eubstautiul  help.

With  a  view  to  lesseniug  this,  an</span><span>  Italian  professor  bas  devised  an  arrangement</span><span>  which  he  has  shown  in  model  at  the  regional</span><span>  Exhibition  of  Biela.  The  barrels  of  inflam-</span></p> <p><span>  mable  liquids  are  placed  on  a  bed  of  pebbles</span><span>  or  sand.  The  floor  is  pierced  with  holes,</span><span>  which  open  into  reservoirs  communicating</span><span>  torough  tubes  with  the  outer  air.  The</span><span>  liquide  from  the  burst  barrels  flow  among  the</span><span>  pebbles  and  are  extinguished,  the  necessary</span><span>  air  failing.

This  France  essaya  to  do  artificially  '</span><span>  and  by  State  intervention,  A  sum  of  two  [</span><span>  millions  sterling  is  to  be  Bet  aside  annually  ;</span><span>  to  encourage  emigration.  The  money  is  to  be  '</span><span>  spent,  partly  in  providing  passages  for  men</span><span>  who  have  finished  their  military  service,  and</span></p> <p><span>  partly  in  developing  an  elaborate  seheme  for  ;</span><span>  making  grantB  of  land.  Several  hundreds  of</span><span>  villages  and  holdings  are  to  be  called  into</span><span>  existence  in  the  new  districts,  which  will  be</span><span>  allotted  to  immigrants  on  arrival,  on  easy</span><span>  terms.  The  paternal  Government  goes  farther</span><span>  and  promises  to  foster  and  look  after  the  new</span><span>  colonists  until  they  are  able  to  run  alone.</span><span>  The  new  villages  will  be  located  close  to  each</span><span>  other,  so  as  to  be  of  mutual  assistance  and</span><span>  support,  thus  ensuring  the  predominance  of</span><span>  the  Frenoh  element.  It  may  be  doubtful</span><span>  whether  even  this  liberal  expenditure  will</span><span>  materially  develop  the  colony.  Publio  money</span><span>  is  easily  squandered  and  misapplied  in  such</span><span>  undertakings.  But  the  chief  difficulty  with</span><span>  France  ia  to  find,  colonists  of  the  proper,</span><span>  stamp.  There  is  no  redundant  horne  popula-</span><span>  tion;  indeed  numbers  in  France  show  a</span><span>  tendency  ,  to  deorease,  rather  than  increase,.</span><span>  Another  drawback  is  the  strong  love  which</span></p> <p><span>  animates  all  Frenchmen  for  La  Belle  France.</span></p> <p><span>  Only  a  few  establish  themselves  permanently</span><span>  in  any  new  country,  the  whole  aim  and  object</span><span>  of  the  expatriated  being  to  save  enough  mopey,</span><span>  to  give  them  An  inoome  to  li  ve  on  at  home.  .</span></p> ",Article,1883-02-19,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

The  general</span><span>  impression  seems  to  bo  that  the  Society  took</span><span>  advantage  of  Mrs.  Stuart's  departure  to  undo</span><span>  thc  work  which  eho  had  laboured  so  zealously</span><span>  to  promote.  When  I  took  the  Secretaryship</span><span>  I  had  no  knowledge  that  my  term  of  office</span><span>  was  likely  to  bc  so  short.  It  was  from  thc</span><span>  late  Secretary  herself  that  I  first  learnt  that</span><span>  the  Nursery  could  not  much  longer  be</span><span>  carried  ou  as  a  separate  institution.  She  had</span><span>  boped  and  believed  that  many  mothers</span><span>  would  bc  glad  to  have  a  homo  for  their</span><span>  children  during  tho  day,  while  thoy  themselves</span></p> <p><span>  went  out  to  work.  Such  institutions  flourish</span></p> <p><span>  in  England,  and  she  saw  no  reaBim  why  they</span><span>  should  not  flourish  hero.  This,  however,  has</span><span>  not  been  tho  case,  The  people  whom  thc</span><span>  Nursery  was  established  to  assist  did  not</span><span>  avail  themselves  of  it,  and  though  at  thc  com-</span><span>  mencement  it  seemed  to  promise  success,  yet</span><span>  iin  spite  of  all  Mrs.  Stuart's  praiseworthy</span></p> <p><span>  efforts,  she  had  at  last  to  acknowledge  that  it</span><span>  had  failed  to  answer  thc  purpose  for  which  it</span></p> <p><span>  was  oriuinallv  intended.</span></p> <p><span>  In  my  report  («hick  by  some  mistake,</span><span>  I  presume,  did  not  get  published  aa</span><span>  usual),  I  explained  that,  out  of  tile  daily</span><span>  average  of  six  cbildrcu  who  ute  the</span><span>  Nursery,  by  far  thc  majority  are  per-</span><span>  manent  boarders,  lt  ie  only  at  intervals  that</span><span>  we  happen  to  got  a  child  in  for  the  day.</span><span>  Kow,  as  each  of  these  resident  children  was</span><span>  costing  Hie  Society  four  times  thc  aiiuiuut</span><span>  actually  paid  by  the  parents,  yon  will  at</span><span>  once  ace  the  necessity  of  closing  so  compara-</span><span>  tively  expensive  au  establishment,  and  re-</span><span>  moving  thc  children  remaining  in  nur  charge</span><span>  to  places  designed  for  snell  cni-eu  -  thc  llrnevu</span><span>  linl  Asylum  and  thc  Orphanage.  From  what</span><span>  1  have  said  it  is  plain  that  no  injustice  has</span><span>  beeu  done  to  Mrs.  Stuart.

"<p><span>  KOCKMAMl'TON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  JUNE  8,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  MR.  ARCHIUALD  FORBES,  who  has</span><span>  achieved  some  notoriety  as  the  war</span></p> <p><span>  j  correspondent  of  the  Daily  Nexis,</span></p> <p><span>  has  honoured  the  Australian  Colonies</span></p> <p><span>  I  with  a  visit.  His  ostensible  purpose</span><span>  j  in  doing  so  is  to  deliver  a  series</span></p> <p><span>  oí  popular  and  personal  lectures,  to</span><span>  i  make  money,  and  to  gather  information</span></p> <p><span>  and  material  the  while,  it  may  be  for</span><span>  lectures  in  Other  countries.  In  carrying</span><span>  out  such  an  enterprise,  it  ts  of  some</span><span>  importance,  in  order  to  draw  auditors  to</span><span>  his  lectures,  that  the  distinguished</span><span>  visitor's  name  should  be  kept  pro</span><span>  !  minently  before  the  public.  The  tactics</span><span>  1  necessary  to  accomplish  this  he  has</span><span>  ,  evidently  studied,  and  he  acts  upon</span></p> <p><span>  them,  apparently  without  much  regard</span><span>  for  the  consequences,  and  without  that</span><span>  I  deference  for  the  intelligence  and  judg-</span><span>  ment  of  others,  which  a  sensible  man  in</span><span>  a  strange  country  would  exercise.  This</span><span>  has  been  shown  by  the  manner  in  which</span><span>  he  has  rushed  into  print  wherever  he  has</span><span>  been  in  the  colonies.  He  is  a  clever,</span><span>  skilful  writer  ;  he  has  ""  the  art  of  putting</span><span>  things  ;""  and  is  not  under  much  restraint</span><span>  in  doing  so  to  suit  his  own  purposes.</span><span>  When  in  Melbourne  and  Sydney  he</span><span>  seized  upon  the  public  questions  then</span><span>  and  there  under  discussion,  and  wrote</span><span>  upon  them  with  his  accustomed  vigour.</span><span>  His  communications  excited  comment,</span><span>  provoked  controversy,  and  attracted  atten-</span><span>  tion  :  they  were  splendid  gratis  advertise-</span><span>  ments,  in  these  circumstances  we  have</span><span>  not  been  at  all  surprised  to  find  that  as</span><span>  soon  as  Mr.  Forbes  got  into  the  run  of</span><span>  things  in  Queensland,  he  should  have</span><span>  favoured  us  with  a  characteristic  contri-</span><span>  bution  to  the  discussion  of  the  Trans-</span><span>  continental  Railway.  He  found  it  the</span><span>  question  of  the  hour  :  materials  for  an</span><span>  article  upon  it  lay  at  his  hand  in  the</span><span>  ""defamatory  pamphlet""  and  other  pro-</span><span>  ductions;  and  he  learned  that  men's</span><span>  minds  were  deeply  exercised  upon  it.  He</span><span>  had  the  columns  of  the  Sydney  Morning</span><span>  Herald  at  his  disposal,  and  so  he  has</span><span>  come  out  with  a  long  letter  on  the</span><span>  scheme.  The  subject  and  the  style</span><span>  alike  command  notice,  and  people  who</span><span>  may  not  have  known  much  about  Mr.</span><span>  Fotbes  before,  will  seek  to  know  some-</span><span>  thing  of  him  now.  His  letter  is  being</span><span>  copied  into  all  the  Liberal  journals  in</span><span>  the  colony,  and  the  author's  praises</span><span>  sounded  as  ""the  distinguished  ready  writer</span><span>  of  universal  truth.""  The  value  of  all</span><span>  this  to  Mr.  Forbes  is  so  evident  we  need</span><span>  not  dwell  upon  it.</span></p> <p><span>  The  letter  we  have  referred  to  deals</span></p> <p><span>  with  the  matter  from  an  apparently</span><span>  impartial  standpoint.  Mr.  Forbes</span><span>  knows  it  would  be  comparatively  value-</span><span>  less  if  he  thowed  bins  or  prejudice,  so</span><span>  these  have  been  carefully  concealed  ;</span><span>  but  it  is  quite  evident  that  some  observa-</span><span>  tions  he  has  made  in  America  have</span><span>  prejudiced  him  against  syndicates.  In</span><span>  fact,  wegather  from  hisremarksthathe  has</span></p> <p><span>  not  much  faith  in  large  companies  and</span><span>  combinations  of  capitalists.

Having  done  this  Mr.</span><span>  Forbes  ""  goes  for  ""  the  syndicate,  whose</span><span>  pinions  overshadow  the  land.  He  dis-</span><span>  covers  three  contingencies  which  may</span><span>  eventuate  from  its  advent,  dismisses  two</span><span>  of  these  briefly,  and,  coming  to  ""  the</span><span>  third  contingency  of  the  handling  of  this</span><span>  unclean  thing,""  he  lays  down  his  pen,</span><span>  wraps  his  prophetic  cloak  around  him,</span><span>  and  imagines  himself  a  syndicate.  That</span><span>  we  may  tremble  at  him  in  this  guise  he</span><span>  paints  with  all  his  skill  a  fearsome</span><span>  picture  of  the  syndicates,  which,  he</span><span>  says,  lord  it  over  the  great  noah</span><span>  west  of  British  America,  and  the  south-</span><span>  west  of  the  United  States  ;  and  then</span><span>  exhibits  himself  as  the  Australian  Trans-</span><span>  continental  Railway  Syndicate,  proceed-</span><span>  ing  ""  with  calm  skill  to  make  Brisbane</span><span>  my  washpot,  and  to  cast  my  shoe  over</span><span>  Queensland.""  The  manner  in  which</span><span>  Mr.  Forbes  describes  his  operations  is</span><span>  singularly  forcible  and  graphic,  and  may</span><span>  strike  terror  into  the  souls  of  timorous</span><span>  people.  The  picture  he  has  so  skillfully</span><span>  drawn  has  no  terrors  for  us,  because  we</span><span>  recognise  it  as  an  improved  portrait  of</span><span>  the  ""bogey,""  with  which  our  Liberal</span><span>  orators  and  squatters  have  been  trying</span><span>  to  frighten  the  community  for  the  last</span><span>  twelve  months.  It  is  the  same  old  scare-</span><span>  crow  which  Mr.  Lumley  Hill  ex-</span><span>  hibited  in  the  Courier  the  other  day.</span><span>  If  Mr.  Forbes  thinks  the  grim  phantom</span><span>  with  which  he  has  confronted  the</span><span>  colonists  of  Queensland,  will  turn  them</span><span>  all  into  stone,  he  is  very  much  mistaken.</span><span>  Mr.  Forbes  alludes  in  one  part  of  his</span><span>  letter  to  ""  those  who  may  be  responsible</span><span>  for  an  able  but  venomous  pamphlet""  on</span><span>  this  subject  of  the  Transcontinental</span><span>  Railway,  and  says  they  have  not  helped</span><span>  the  force  of  their  reasoning  by  the  impu-</span><span>  tation  of  discreditable  motives  to  the</span><span>  official  foster-fathers  of  the  enterprise.</span><span>  Nevertheless,  in  acting  as  a  syndicate</span><span>  in  personating  the  persons  who  have</span><span>  entered  into  an  agreement  with  our</span></p> <p><span>  r;"",.o-n.n-i,  it.,  ruioca  represents</span></p> <p><span>  them  as  actuated  by  the  motives  and</span><span>  morality  of  such  men  as  Jay</span><span>  Gould,  and  the  Vanderbilts.  ""Hom</span><span>  soi  gui  mal-y-pense?  The  syndicate</span><span>  which  desired  to  construct  the  Warrego</span><span>  Railway  was  composed  of  gentlemen</span><span>  belonging  to,  weil  known,  and  respected</span><span>  in  these  colonies.  The  Australian  Trans-</span><span>  continental  Syndicate  is  composed  of</span><span>  about  sixty  gentlemen,  many  of  them</span><span>  already  the  possessors  of  property  in</span><span>  the  colony,  and  largely  interested  in  our</span><span>  material  prosperity.  To  compare  them</span><span>  to  tile  ""ring-makers""  of  the  United</span><span>  States  is  manifestly  unfair.  We  are  not</span><span>  prepared,  moreover,  to  accept  Mr.  Forbes</span><span>  dictum-that  a  syndicate  has  no  con-</span><span>  science.  The  name  syndicate  is  but</span><span>  another  one  for  a  company,  and  we  know</span><span>  how  much  companies  have  done  for</span><span>  the  promotion  of  the  mechanical</span><span>  and  industrial  arts  in  all  civilised</span><span>  countries.  Notwithstanding  Mr.  Forbes'</span><span>  fine  phrases,  about  the  power  of  the</span><span>  American  syndicates,  we  have  yet  to</span><span>  learn  that  the  material  comfort,  well-</span><span>  being,  and  independence  of  the  people</span><span>  have  been  hampered  by  them.  Peace-</span><span>  ful  prosperity  and  freedom  prevail</span><span>  to  as  great  an  extent  in  América  as  in  any</span><span>  other  country  ;  and  the  railways,  which</span><span>  have  opened  up  new  territories  and  pro-</span><span>  vided  homes  for  thousands  of  immi-</span><span>  grants,  were  made  by  syndicates.</span><span>  Without  them  America  would  not  have</span><span>  been  to-day  su  thickly  settled  and  so  pros-</span><span>  perous.  Such  a  syndicate  as  Mr.  Forbes'</span><span>  can  imagine  himself  to  be  might  act  in  the</span><span>  incoascionable,  greedy,  avaricious  manner</span><span>  he  describes;  but  we  trust  there  are  men</span><span>  capable  of  conceiving  and  dealing  with</span><span>  their  fellows  in  a  more  honourable,</span><span>  praiseworthy,  and  bénéficient  fashion  ;</span><span>  and  we  have  no  reason  to  doubt  that</span><span>  there  is  a  large  majority  of  such  in  the</span><span>  Australian  Transcontinental  Railway</span><span>  Syndicate.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court  yesterday  before  tho</span><span>  Police  Magistrate,  Thomas  lieos,  charged  with</span><span>  drunkenness,  was  cautioned  and  discharged.</span><span>  He  was  also  charged  with  indecent  exposure,</span><span>  .pd  sentenced  to  eight  hours'  imprisonment.</span></p> <p><span>  /TUE  new  wharf  at  Auckland  Point  (says</span><span>  the  Qladxtom  Obmrva  )  now  in  course  of</span><span>  erection,  is  making  fair  progress.

anticipated  a</span><span>  dissolution  will  not  be  disappointed</span><span>  The  Premier  has  advised  the  Adminis</span><span>  trator  of  the  Government  to  dissolve</span><span>

 opposed  to  the  total  alienation  of  the</span><span>  public  estate  Giving  expression  to  this</span><span>  principle  he  voted  against  the  second</span><span>  reading  of  the

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  JULY  18,  »883.</span></p> <p><span>  AMONG  the  important  questions  in-</span><span>  volved  in  the  discussion  of  the  Trans-</span><span>  continental  Railway  Scheme  under</span><span>  present  circumstances,  is  that  of  the</span><span>  management  of  railways  by  thc  State.</span><span>  Some  politicians,  and,  if  we  mistake,</span><span>  not  among  that  number  is  the  Premier,</span><span>  are  of  opinion  that  the  iron  highways  of</span><span>  trade  and  commerce  are  made  most  sub-</span><span>  servient  to  these  interests,  when  they  are</span><span>  in  the  hands  of  private  companies.  In</span><span>  proof  of  this  they  point  to  the.  success</span><span>  which  has  attended  the  railway  systems</span><span>  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  in  America,</span><span>  and  the  prosperity  they  have  created  and</span><span>  fostered  in  these  countries.  Others  trace</span><span>  ihe  monopolies  and  disabilities,  from</span><span>  which  the  public  in  both  these  countries</span><span>  have  suffered  under  the  railway  systems,</span><span>  to  the  fact  that  the  lines  have  been  in</span><span>  private  hands.  The  general  complaint,</span><span>  which  is  held  to  explain  a  multitude  of</span><span>  minor  grievances,  is  that  the  railways  are</span><span>  worked  for  the  benefit  of  the  share-</span><span>  holders,  and  often  to  the  detriment  of</span><span>  the  public  interests.  When  the  railways</span><span>  are  in  the  hands  of  the  Government  they</span><span>  are  worked  for  the  public  benefit.  In</span><span>  the  Australian  Colonies  the  practice  has</span><span>  been  for  the  State  to  make  and</span><span>  maintain  the  railways.  That  thc</span><span>  system  has  been  attended  with  unquali-</span><span>  fied  success  we  arc  not  prepared  to</span><span>  demonstrate  ;  but,  we  do  submit,  nothing</span><span>  has  occurred  which  should  induce  any</span><span>  of  t,he  Colonies  lightly  to  relinquish</span><span>  control  of  their  railways.  Into  the</span><span>  general  question  of  the  management  of</span><span>  railways  by  the  State,  we  do  not  propose</span></p> <p><span>  to  enter  at  present,  but  would  direct  our</span><span>  readers'  attention  to  the  latest  plan</span><span>  proposed  for  doing  so.  We  have</span><span>  heard  it  advanced  as  an  argument</span><span>  against  the  management  of  railways  by</span></p> <p><span>  the  State,  that  as  soon  as  the  Victorian</span><span>  Government  acquired  the  private  lines</span><span>  in  that  colony,  mismanagement  began</span><span>  and  accidents  happened.  But  we  have</span><span>  repeated  and  painful  evidence  from  the</span><span>  United  Kingdom  that  bungling  and</span><span>  blundering  are  too  frequent  on  the  lines</span><span>  there.  Whatever  faults  lhere  may  have</span><span>  been  in  connection  with  railway  manage-</span><span>  ment  in  Victoria,  the  Government  seem</span><span>  to  have  determined  to  remedy  them</span><span>  by  the  adoption  of  a  new  system</span><span>  of  working.  A  Ministerial  measure,</span><span>  about  to  be  submitted  to  Parlia-</span><span>  ment,  embodies  the  newest  ideas,  and</span><span>  most  carefully  considered  resolutions  on</span><span>  the  subject.  It  embodies  principals  and</span><span>  possesses  features  characteristic  bf  the</span><span>  railway  system  of  the  United  Kingdon.</span><span>  There  the  President  of  the  Board  ol</span><span>  Trade  is  responsible  to  Parliament  foi</span><span>  the  protection  of  the  life  and  property  ol</span><span>  the  people,  who  ate  under  the  necessity</span><span>  of  using  railways,  from  the  carelessness</span><span>  of  servants  and  the  avarice  of  boards  ol</span><span>  Directors.  Under  the  new  Act  ir</span><span>  Victoria  the  intermediary  between  the</span><span>  railway  managers  and  the  Parliament  is</span><span>  to  be  a  Minister  of  the  Crown.  Im</span><span>  mediately  beneath  him,  owing  to  theil</span><span>  appointments  to  the  Governor  in</span><span>  I  Council,  and  holding  office  during  theil</span><span>  i  good  behaviour  are  to  be  the  members</span><span>  I  of  a  corporate  body  to  be  callee</span></p> <p><span>  ""  the  Victorian  Railway  Commissioners.""</span><span>  While  the  Government  are  to  provide</span><span>  funds  for  the  construction,  maintenance,</span><span>  and  management  of  the  railways  ail  the</span><span>  details  connected  with  the  formation  and</span><span>  working  are  to  be  entrusted  to  the  Com-</span><span>  missioners.  In  them  all  railway  works</span><span>  are  to  vested.  They  are  to  appoint  and</span><span>  be  responsible  for  the  conduct  of  thc</span><span>  subordinate  officials,  but  must  choose</span><span>  persons  for  appointment  from  a  list  ol</span><span>  those  who  have  passed  a  prescribed</span><span>  examination,  unless  in  very  exceptional</span><span>  circumstances.  They  are  also  to  have</span><span>  large  powers  to  make  byelaws  and  regu-</span><span>  lations.  This  scheme,  it  will  be  seen,</span><span>  has  been  drawn  on  principles  similar  to</span><span>  that  which  obtains  in  Queensland,  with</span><span>  this  essential  difference,  that  lhere  are  tc</span></p> <p><span>  be  three  Commissioners.  The  body  of</span><span>  Commissioners  will  occupy  the  same</span><span>  relation  to  the  public  and  Parliament</span><span>  that  the  Boards  of  Railway  Directors  in</span><span>  the  United  Kingdom  occupy  to  thc</span><span>  communities,  which  are  served  by  their</span><span>  lines,  and  to  the  shareholders.  There  are</span><span>  few,  if  any,  of  these  Boards  composed  of</span><span>  less  than  seven  members.  The  number</span><span>  of  Commissioners,  therefore,  which  it  is</span><span>  proposed  to  appoint  in  Victoria  is  not</span><span>  too  large.  In  fact,  the  number  might,</span><span>  with  advantage,  be  increased.  Of  course</span><span>  lhere  will  be  this  difference  between</span><span>  them  and  railway  directors,  that  while</span><span>  ihe  latter  devote  only  a  porlion  of  their</span><span>  time  lo  railway  business,  the  former</span><span>  would  give  all  their  lime  to  the  discharge</span><span>  of  their  duties.  Three  Commissioners</span><span>  who  visit  the  new  works  ;  maintain  a</span><span>  close  superintendence  on  th»  lines</span><span>  opened  ;  and  attend  to  the  details  of</span><span>  ir.iffic  and  mail  arrangements  will  have</span><span>  their  lime  fully  occupied.</span></p> <p><span>  Those  of  our  readers  who  have</span><span>  perused  the  evidence  given  in  thc  recent</span><span>  railway  inquiry  in  lliis  colony,  will,  no</span><span>  doubt  bc  ready  to  conclude  with  us  that</span><span>  some  such  managing  board  or  Commis-</span><span>  sioners  should  be  established  in  connec-</span><span>  tion  with  our  railways.  The  time  seems</span><span>  to  have  gone  past  when  the  management</span></p> <p><span>  of  our  railways  should  remain  in  the</span><span>  hands  of  one  man.  Some  evidence  that</span><span>  the  present  Government  are  of  the  same</span><span>  opinion  may  be  found  in  the  appoint-</span><span>  ment  of  Mr.  Horniblow  as  superinten-</span><span>  dent  of  rolling  stock  on  all  the  lines  in</span><span>  the  colony.  With  regard  to  thc  supply</span><span>  of  locomotives,  carriages,  and  wagons,</span><span>  he  will  be  responsible  to  the  Commis-</span><span>  sioner,  and  he  again  to  the  Minister  for</span><span>  Works.  Now  this  is  a  perpetuation  of  a</span><span>  cumbrous  system,  and  lt  is  quite  plain</span><span>  that  it  would  be  much  better,  instead  of</span><span>  having  our  Minister  for  Works  rambling</span><span>  over  the  colonies  with  the  Commissioner</span><span>  for  Railways  dancing  attendance  upon</span><span>  him,  that  there  should  be  three</span><span>  competent  commissioners,  capable  of</span><span>  managing  our  railways  without  troubling</span><span>  the  Minister  as  to  petty  details.  If  the</span><span>  railway  management  were  more  inde-</span><span>  pendent  of  political  influence  than  it  is</span><span>  at  present,  the  service  would  be  carried</span><span>  on  more  cheaply,  safely,  and  satisfac-</span><span>  torily,  Should  our  Railway  Commission,</span><span>  therefore,  report  in  favour  of  a  per-</span><span>  manent  Board  ot  Management  or  Com-</span><span>  missioners  in  this  colony,  the  public  will</span><span>  have  reason  to  rejoice  at  its  decision,  and</span><span>  should  urge  that  effect  be  given  to  it.</span></p> ",Article,1883-07-18,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

Let  me</span><span>  recall  the  circumstances.  In  the  latter  part  of</span><span>  1807.  or  the  beginning  of  1868,  a  number  of</span><span>  Rockhampton  gentlemen  interested  in  thc  wel-</span><span>  fare  of  thc  colony,  being  of  opinion  that  no-</span><span>  thing  could  advance  the  interests  of  the  colony</span><span>  so  mnch  as  settling  the  people  on  the  lands,</span><span>  requested  the  late  Mr.  Ilea  (who  was  one</span><span>  nf  thc  number)  tn  make  a  rough  draft  of  a</span><span>  Bill  embodying  their  views  on  tho  matter.</span><span>  Mr.  Ilea  did  BO,  and  Mr.  Archer,  who  was  an-</span><span>  other  ef  the  number,  undertook  to  bring  the</span><span>  Bill  before  Parliament.  Being  a  new  member,</span><span>  and  unacquainted  with  the  forms  of</span><span>  the  Mouse  and  methods  of  procedure,  he  ob</span><span>  taincd  the  assistance  of  Mr.  Fitzgerald,</span><span>  and  they,  by  good  judgment  and  good</span><span>  argument,  succeeded  in  getting  thc  Bili  passed,</span><span>  not  exactly  in  BO  liberal  n  shape  as  they  wished,</span><span>  but  in  the  form  of  the  Crown  Lands  Aliena-</span><span>  tion  Act  of  1868.  Now,  I  claim  for  this  Act</span><span>  that  it  was  thc  first  which  enabled  a  settler  ia</span><span>  any  part  of  Australia  to  obtain  land  for  less</span><span>  than  ono  pound  per  acre  ;  and  that  it  had  the</span><span>  effect  during  thc  time  it  waa  in  operation  of</span><span>  settling  a  greater  portion  of  thc  population  of</span><span>  the  colony  on  thc  lands  of  the  colony,  than</span><span>  any  other  Act  in  any  of  the  Australian</span><span>  Colonies.  Had  thc  Act  been  less  liberal  it</span><span>  would  not  have  been  so  successful.  We</span><span>  should  not  have  done  so  well,  and  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  would  not  bo  so  prosperous.  Had  it</span><span>  been  less  liberal  the  people  would  not  so</span><span>  freely  have  selected,  the  pastoral  lessees  would</span><span>  have  beld  their  runs  for  many  years  longer,</span><span>  possibly  even  to  the  present  day,  and  those</span></p> <p><span>  who  remember  the  difficulty  Mr,  Archer  bsd  j</span></p> <p><span>  to  pas*  the  measure,  roust  know  that,  had  he</span><span>  not  exerted  himself  to  the  ntmost,  the  Act</span><span>  could  not  have  been  passed.  The  Act  has</span><span>  been  altered,  I  cannot  say  amended,  and  the</span><span>  alterations  have  had  the  effect  of  somewhat  re-</span><span>  tarding  settlement,  for  we  find  that  most  of  the</span><span>  selections  made  under  the  Act  of  1S76  were</span><span>  made  by  men  who  were  already  settled</span><span>  I  upon  lauds  held  under  the  Act  of  1868.</span></p> <p><span>  It  has  been  said  that  in  passing  that</span><span>  Act  Mr.  Archer  wished  to  benefit  himself,</span><span>  that  bc  wished  to  select,  and  that  he  did</span><span>  select.  It  is  true  that  he  did  select,  having</span><span>  os  much  right  as  any  of  us,  hut  he  did  not</span><span>  dummy  ;  and  had  he  studied  his  own  interest</span><span>  as  much  as  he  studied  ours  he  would  now  be</span><span>  richer,  and  we  should  not  be  so  well  off.  As</span></p> <p><span>  !  regards  Mr.  Macdonald,  I  will  say  nothing</span></p> <p><span>  against  his  intelligence,  for  we  oil  know  bow</span><span>  wisely  he  has  ever  managed  hie  own  affairs  ;  nor</span><span>  shall  I  say  anything  against  his  integrity,  for</span><span>  I  believe  that  he  is  a  man  of  his  word  (here</span><span>  let  me  express  my  astonishment  and  regret</span><span>  that  he  should  to-day  have  expressed  a  doubt</span><span>  of  Mr.  Archer's  word)  ;  but,  Sir,  I  fear  Mr.</span><span>  Macdonald  is  too  intelligent  to  neglect  his  own</span><span>  business  for  the  purpose  of  attending  to  that</span><span>  of  other  people  ;  that  he  is  too  wise  or  too</span><span>  sellish  to  waste  his  own  time  over  publio</span><span>  matters  ;  and  be  has  shewn  this  by  bis  atten-</span><span>  dance  at  thc  Divisional  Board,  and  by  his</span><span>  entry  into  aud  retiremeut  from  the  Legislative</span><span>  Assembly.  lu  fact,  Sir,  he  has  ever  shewn  by</span><span>  bis  actions  that  he  considers  his  first  and  only</span><span>  duty  is  his  duty  to  himself.  Nor  can  I  very</span><span>  much  blame  bim  for  seeing  bow  ungrateful</span><span>  the  public  are  to  their  best  servants.

Mr</span><span>  Archer  explains,  the  Government  could</span><span>  not  do  impossibilities,  they  could  not  take</span><span>  the  work  out  of  the  contractors'  hands,</span><span>  and

seems  inclined  to  favour  the  policy  of</span><span>  the  Opposition,  and  bring  people  into</span><span>  the  colonv  at  a  greater  rate  than  they</span><span>  are  coming  at  present  The  probable</span><span>  results  of  a  large  influx  of  labour,  at  the</span><span>  rate  of  forty  thousand  a  year,  as  Mr</span><span>  Griffith  proposes,  must  be  considered</span><span>  If  we  stop  branch  lines  of  railway,  cut</span><span>  donn  expenditure  on  other  public  works,</span><span>  and  limit  our  borrowing  arrangements,</span><span>  the  people  will  be  forced  to  make  work</span><span>  for  themselves,  or  join  the  gangs  in  the</span><span>  canefields  One  thing  seems  pretty</span><span>  certain,  if  fifteen  or  twenty  thousand</span><span>  people  are  landed  at  this  port  within</span><span>  the  next  twelve  months,  that  labour  will</span><span>  be  more  plentiful,  and,

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  SEPTEMBER  15,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  think  it  not  improbable  a  large  num-</span><span>  ber  of  our  readers  woald  share  the</span><span>  feeling  of  astonishment  with  which  we</span><span>  read  the  communication  addressed  to</span><span>  the  Municipal  Council  by  Mr.  Edwin  J.</span><span>  Smith,  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Direc-</span><span>  tors  of  the  Rockhampton  and  Northside</span><span>  Tramway  Company,  Limited.  More</span><span>  than  a  year  has  elapsed  since  Mr.</span><span>  William  Allen  introduced  the  subject  of</span><span>  tramways  to  the  notice  of  the  Council.</span><span>  At  that  time  his  proposals  were  deemed</span><span>  premature,  and  no  more  was  heard  of</span><span>  the  subject.  Now  the  community  learn</span><span>  with  surprise  that  a  tramway  company</span><span>  has  been  formed  ;  that  plans,  sections,</span><span>  details,  estimates  of  costs  have  all  been</span><span>  prepared  ;  and  that  unless  they  object  a</span><span>  monopoly  will  be  created  in  our  midst,</span><span>  of  which  it  is  impossible  to  forecast  the</span><span>  results  or  calculate  the  influence  it  may</span><span>  have  on  the  social  and  commercial  wel-</span><span>  fare  of  our  citizens.  From  the  memo-</span><span>  randum  of  agreement,  &c.,  deposited  at</span><span>  the  office  of  the  Town  Clerk,  we  learn</span><span>  that  ""The  object  for  which  the  company</span><span>  is  established  is  the  construction  of  a</span><span>  tramway  for  the  conveyance  of  passen-</span><span>  gers  and  freight  between  the  town  of</span><span>  Rockhampton  and  the  north  side  of  the</span><span>  Fitzroy  River,  commonly  known  as</span><span>  North  Rockhampton,  the  running  of</span><span>  passenger  carriages  and  freight  trucks  on</span><span>  the  said  tramway,  the  purchase  and  sale</span><span>  of  real  estate  in  connection  with  the</span><span>  above  objects,  and  the  erection  of  houses,</span><span>  offices,  stables,  dams,  tanks,  reservoirs,</span><span>  or  other  works,  which  may  be  neces-</span><span>  sary  for  carrying  on  the  business</span><span>  of  the  company.""  The  company  has</span><span>  been  formed  under  limited  liability  ;  the</span><span>  capital  is  £5000  in  one  thousand  shares</span><span>  of  £5  each.  Mr.  Smith  certifies  that</span><span>  956  shares  have  been  applied  for,  and</span><span>  five  shillings  paid  on  each.  The  share-</span><span>  holders  and  their  interest  in  the  company</span></p> <p><span>  are  as  follow  :—</span></p> <p><span>  Edwin  J.  Smith,  architect.

The  tramway  is  to</span><span>  commence  at  a  point  in  the  centre  of</span><span>  Denison-street  distant  580  feet  easterly</span><span>  from  the  intersection  of  Denison  and</span><span>  Stanley  Streets  opposite  the  station  of</span><span>  the  Central  Railway,  and  is  to  extend  to</span><span>  a  point  in  the  Yaamba  Road  at  North</span><span>  Rockhampton  distant  fifty  feet  south  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  intersection  of  the  centre  line  of  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  Yaamba  Road  and  Elphinston  Road,</span><span>  said  point  being  in  the  immediate  &nbsp;</span><span>  vicinity  of  thc  north  east  corner  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  portion  70,  parish  of  Archer,  county  of  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  Livingstone  known  as  Beda  estate,  and</span><span>  is  to  follow  the  route  indicated  on</span><span>  drawing  No.  1  occompanying  this  speci-</span><span>  fication,  and  entitled  ""  Plan  of  proposed</span><span>  tramway  between  Rockhampton  and</span><span>  North  side  of  Fitzroy  River.""  On  ex-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  amining  the  plan  we  find  the  tramway  is</span><span>  to  start  near  the  Central  Railway  Station,</span><span>  and  run  along  Denison  Street  to  William</span><span>  Street  ;  along  it  to  East  Street  ;  along  it</span><span>  to  Fitzroy  Street  ;  along  it  and  Fitzroy</span><span>  Bridge  to  North  Rockhampton,  and</span><span>  along  the  Lake's  Creek  road  to  where  it  &nbsp;</span><span>  is  joined  by  the  Yaamba  Road  ;  along  it  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  the  tramway  runs  to  Elphinstone  Street</span><span>  -—a  new  thoroughfare  to  be  formed  some</span><span>  day  at  right  angles  to  the  Yaamba  Road.</span><span>  The  cost  of  construction  is  estimated  at</span><span>  £1500  per  mile,  and  the  formation  of</span><span>  the  tramway  &c.  at  £4250  made  up  as</span><span>  follows  :  Construction  of  road  £3350  ;</span><span>  two  carriages  £400  ;  buildings  £200  ;</span><span>  horses  £150  ;  harness  and  utensils £150.</span></p> <p><span>  Some  people  may  be  disposed  to</span><span>  laugh  at  the  whole  affair  as  a  joke,  look</span><span>  upon  it  as  ""  tramway  in  the  air  ;  ""  and</span><span>  treat  it  with  contemptuous  ridicule.</span><span>  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  one  at  least</span><span>  of  the  shareholders  of  this  nice  little</span><span>  company  is  in  dead  earnest,  and  that  he</span><span>  will  leave  no  stone  unturned  lo  realise</span><span>  his  scheme.  It  will  not  do  for  the  Town</span><span>  Council  to  trifle  with  it.  Under  the</span><span>  Companies'  Act,  1863,  any  number  of</span><span>  persons  not  less  than  seven  may  form  a</span><span>  company,  and  such  a  company  the</span><span>  Tramways  Act  provides  may  be  the</span><span>  ""constructing  authority  ""  under  it.  This</span><span>  authority  is  bound  to  submit  copy  of</span><span>  plans,  &c.,  to  the  Minister  charged  with</span><span>  the  Administration  of  the  Act,  to</span><span>  the  Council,  and  to  the  Gogango</span><span>  Divisional  Board.  This  has  been  done,</span><span>  and  it  is  most  likely  an  application  has</span><span>  been  made  to  the  Minister  for  an  Order</span><span>  in  Council  to  construct  this  tramway.</span><span>  Unless  the  Council  petition  against  the</span></p> <p><span>  scheme  an  order  will  be  issued,  and</span><span>  powers  may  be  vested  in  the  company</span><span>  giving  them  control  of  tramway  con-</span><span>  struction  and  communication  in  all  time</span><span>  coming.  It  will  be  the  duty  of  our</span><span>  aldermen  to  consider  the  memorandum,</span><span>  plans,  documents,  &c.,  which  have  been</span><span>  laid  on  the  Council  table,  and  determine</span><span>  what  shall  be  done  in  this  matter.  If</span><span>  they  look  to  the  public  interests,  we</span><span>  apprehend  they  will  feel  it  to  be  their</span><span>  duty  to  petition  that  the  Order  in</span><span>  Council  sought  by  the  tramway  com-</span><span>  pany  be  not  granted.  It  is  apparent</span><span>  that  the  concession  is  not  sought  in  the</span><span>  interests  of  a  public  company  such  as  is</span><span>  contemplated  by  ""  The  Companies  Act</span><span>  of  1863.""  It  stipulates  that  there  must</span><span>  be  seven  members  in  a  company,  but  of</span><span>  what  weight  would  the  six  members  in</span><span>  the  tramway  company  be  beside  the</span><span>  Omnipotent  Chairman.  A  glance  at  the</span><span>  share  list  shows  that  really  he  is  the</span><span>  company,  and  the  others  have  been  let</span><span>  in  merely  to  fill  up.  So  far  as  we  can</span><span>  make  out  the  general  public  are  to  be</span><span>  represented  outside  the  Directorate  al-</span><span>  ready  constituted  by  four  five  pound</span><span>  shares.  As  the  relations  of  tramway</span><span>  companies  and  Councils  under  the</span><span>  Tramways  Act  are  numerous,  varied,</span><span>  and  highly  important  we  think  the</span><span>  Council  will  not  be  acting  wisely  in</span><span>  recognising  the  locus  standi  of  this  com-</span><span>  pany,  even  though  the  Mayor  has  a  five  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  pound  share  in  it.  The  scheme,  more-</span><span>  over,  is  not  one  that  will  commend  it  to</span><span>  the  public.  It  would  doubtless,  if  carried</span><span>  out,  greatly  enhance  the  value  of  pro-  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  perty  adjacent  to  the  Yaamba  Road,  in</span><span>  which  the  Chairman  of  the  Company  is</span><span>  interested,  but  it  would  not  be  such  a</span><span>  convenient  and  useful  scheme  as  others</span></p> <p><span>  that  might  be  devised.  A  tramway  on</span><span>  the  Fitzroy  Bridge  would  be  an</span><span>  intolerable  nuisance,  and  a  permanent</span><span>  source  of  danger.  Besides,  there  would</span><span>  not  be  room  for  it,  unless  other</span><span>  vehicular  traffic  were  stopped.  For</span><span>  these  and  other  reasons  that  will</span><span>  occur  to  our  Aldermen,  we  think  the</span><span>  Town  Council  should  unanimously</span><span>  petition  against  an  order  in  Council</span><span>  being  granted  to  this  Rockhampton  and</span><span>  North  Side  Tramway  Company.</span></p> ",Article,1883-09-15,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

With  the</span><span>  exception  of  Wellshot  station,  40  miles  from</span><span>  Isisford,  on  which  there  is  both  water  and</span><span>  grass,  the  runs  are  destitute  of  either.

His  views  will  not,  I  think,  bo</span><span>  endorsed  by  many  of  the  ratepayers,  and  was</span><span>  probably  dictated  rather  by  à  spirit  of</span><span>  opposition  to  your  expressed  views  on  that</span><span>  subject  rather  than  by  his  own  judgment.</span><span>  He  says'  Mr.  Wakefield  abandoned  his  con-</span><span>  tract,  and  the  Mayor  agreed  to  the  abandon-</span><span>  ment.  I  would  ask  if  the  Mayor  has  power</span><span>  to  make  contracts  without  consulting  the</span><span>  Council?  and  if  not,  how  can  he  have  power</span><span>  to  absolve  a  contractor  from  his  engagements  ?</span></p> <p><span>  ThiB  affair  of  Mr.  Wakefield's  doss  not  look</span><span>  like  a  bona  fide  giving  up  of  his  contract.</span><span>  Who  has  ho  given  the  contract  over  tot  Why,</span><span>  an  employé  of  his  own,  who  has  been  working</span><span>  in  his  shop  for  years,  and  is  still  working</span><span>  there.  It  looks  very  much  like  cases  I  have</span><span>  known  of  insolvent  debtors,  who  nut  the  name,</span></p> <p><span>  of  some  Bi  their  clerks  over  the  door  to  evade</span></p> <p><span>  the  law,  but  who  still  pocket  the  cash</span><span>  receipts.  In  the  case  of  the  Returning  Officer</span><span>  a  complete  muddle  was  made-the  Mayor's</span><span>  name  appeared  to  the  advertisements.  Mr.</span><span>  Sumner  was  appointed  by  the  Council,  but</span><span>  Mr.  Williamson  RCted  in  that  capacity  at  the</span><span>  nomination,  but  on  What  authority  I  know</span><span>  not.  The  question  will  be  asked-Who  was</span><span>  the  Returning  Officer  7  The  gentleman  whose</span><span>  name  appeared  in  the  paper,  the  one  who  was</span><span>  appointed  by  the  Council,  or  the  one  who</span><span>  officiated  at  the  Council  Chamber.

Thc  facts  of  the  case  are  simply</span><span>  these,  the  Rev.  Lord  Archhald  Douglas  a</span><span>  brother  of  the  Marquis  of  QueenBberry  and  of</span><span>  Lady  Florence  Dixie,  joined  the  Church  of</span><span>  Rome  some  years  ago,  and  after  the  usual</span><span>  course  of  study  and  probation  was  ordained  a</span><span>  priest  by  Cardinal  Manning.  Since  then  be</span><span>  bas  devoted  his  life  and  money  towards  the</span><span>  reclamation  of  boys,  '  waifs  and  strays  '  from</span><span>  the  street,  to  whom  ho  gives  a  home,  teaches</span><span>  them  useful  trades,  and  then  starts  them  in</span><span>  life.  At  the  institution  which  be  has</span><span>  founded  and  maintains,  and  where  he</span><span>  always  resides,  situated  in  Woodfield</span><span>  Terrace,  Harrow  Road,  Paddington,  there</span><span>  are  some  seventy  or  eighty  of  these  lads,  all</span><span>  of  whom  are  being  trained  to  be  industrious</span><span>  working  men.  But  the  housekeeping,  the</span><span>  eating,  and  drinking  is  naturally  a  source  of</span><span>  atmety  to  Lord  Archibald,  and  although</span><span>  greatly  assisted  by  the  subscriptions  or  his  co-</span><span>  religionists  and  others  he  finds  that  the  good</span><span>  old  rule  of  'waste  not  want  not  'is  not</span></p> <p><span>  observed  hy  those  who  havo  charge  of  provid-  '</span><span>  ing  for  the  wants  of  so  large  an  establishment.</span><span>  lu  order  to  put  matters  upon  a  more  satisfac-</span><span>  tory  footing,  he  invited  his  sister.  Lady</span><span>  Gertrude  Doughs,  who  ÍB  also  a  oonvert  to</span><span>  the  Catholic  Church,  to  live  with  him,  and</span><span>  Bincc  then  some  matters  have  been  on  a  much</span></p> <p><span>  more  satisfactory  footing.  Some  three  months</span><span>  ago  Lord  Archibald  went  to  Canada,  taking</span><span>  withhim  iorty  boys  of  the  Home  for  the  purpose</span><span>  of  establishing  them  as  farmers  in  the  Far</span><span>  Weit.  During  his  absence  he  received  a  letter</span></p> <p><span>  from  his  sister  stating  that  shs  wu  about  to</span><span>  marry  a  young  man  who  bad  been  brought  up</span><span>  by  ber'brother,  and  who  waa  now  acting  oe</span><span>  head  baker  of  the  establishment.  His  lord-</span></p> <p><span>  ship  was  greatly  taken  aback  by  the  news,</span><span>  and  telegraphed  and  wrote  from  Canada'</span><span>  urging  his  sister  at  any  rate  to  delay  her</span><span>  intended  marriage  until  bia  return.

"<p><span>  KOCKIiAMl'TON.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  FEBRUARY  10,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  As  the  people  of  Rockhampton  and  the</span><span>  surrounding  district  consider  the  great</span><span>  influence  the  successlul  promotion</span><span>  of  the  sugar  industry  is  calculated  to</span><span>  have  upon  the  material  prosperity  of</span><span>  town  and  country,  they  will  come  to  the</span><span>  conclusion,  that  only  for  the  most  obvious</span><span>  and  substantial  reasons  should  anything</span><span>  be  done  that  will  impede  its  growth.</span><span>  This  will  lead  many  of  them  to  declare</span><span>  as  Hon.  Mr.  Archer  did,  when  last  he</span><span>  addressed  the  electors  of  Blackall-that</span><span>  rather  than  obstruct  the  infant  industry,</span><span>  they  would  assist  in  introducing  Coolies.</span><span>  To  his  mind  the  case  was  clear  :  No</span><span>  Coolies-no  sugar.  The  closer  we  are</span><span>  brought  to  the  realities  of  the  circum-</span><span>  stances  connected  with  sugar  culture,</span><span>  the  more  strongly  must  this  convic-</span><span>  tion  be  forced  on  every  mind.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Macdonald  has  informed  us</span><span>  that  to  secure  the  success  this  season  of</span><span>  the  cane  crop,  now  making  a  fair  show  at</span><span>  Pandora  Plantation,  about  fifty  labourers</span><span>  should  at  once  be  employed.  White</span><span>  men  might  be  employed  ;  but,  like  the</span><span>  Scotch  piper,  who  recently  spent  a  few</span><span>  days  in  the  cane-fields,  they  will  give  up</span><span>  the  work  in  disgust.  We  must  have</span><span>  cheap  and  reliable  labour.  Within  the</span><span>  last  few  days-and  even  in  to-day's</span><span>  impression-we  have  had  incontro-</span></p> <p><span>  vertible  evidence  that  the  soil  and</span><span>  climate  of  the  Central  District  are</span><span>  eminently  suited  for  the  growth  of  sugar-</span><span>  cane.  What  we  now  want  is  a  class</span><span>  of  workers  fitted  for  the  cultivation  of</span><span>  the  sugar-cane.  Within  the  last  week</span><span>  we  have  become  better  qualified  to</span><span>  judge  of  the  reasons  why  the  people  ol</span><span>  Mackay,  Townsville,  and  other  coast</span><span>  towns  should  be  so  anxious  to  have</span><span>  more  cheap  labour.  Our  condition  now</span><span>  resembles  theirs.  The  state  of  matters  is</span></p> <p><span>  now  so  plain  that  ""he  who  runs  may</span></p> <p><span>  read.""</span></p> <p><span>  In  these  circumstances  the  correspon-</span><span>  dence,  which  appeared  in  our  columns</span><span>  yesterday,  cannot  havebeen  read  with  other</span><span>  than  the  deepest  interest.  It  will  go  a  long</span><span>  way,  we  think,  to  show  that  the  evils,</span><span>  predicted  in  connection  with  the  intro-</span><span>  duction  of  Coolies,  are  not  so  dreadful</span><span>  as  some  persons,  for  political  purposes,</span><span>  would  have  us  suppose.  Dr.  Cunning-</span><span>  ham,  who  was  asked  by  us  to  favour  the</span><span>  community  Jwitb  information  upon  the</span><span>  employment  of  Coolies,  is  a  gentleman</span><span>  well  qualified  to  furnish  it.  He  has</span><span>  become  familiar  with  the  Coolie</span></p> <p><span>  system  of  emigration  ;  and,  from</span><span>  residence  in  the  West  Indies,  he</span><span>  has  gained,  by  personal  experience</span><span>  and  observation,  an  intimate  knowledge</span><span>  of  the  lives  led  by  Coolies,  and  their</span><span>  influence  on  the  population  among</span><span>  whom  they  reside.  The  questions  pro-</span><span>  pounded  to  Dr.  Cunningham  being  of  a</span><span>  general  character,  his  answers  are  the</span><span>  same  ;  hut  it  seems  to  us  they  assist  to</span></p> <p><span>  settle  some  points  on  which  there  has  j</span><span>  been  much  discussion.  With  regard  to  ]</span></p> <p><span>  the  Coolies  themselves,  the  testimony  of</span><span>  Dr.  Cunnigham  is  very  satisfactory.</span><span>  Neither  in  engaging,  transporting,</span><span>  working,  or  treating  them  generally,</span><span>  are  they  used  like  slaves.  Indeed,  the</span><span>  Imperial  legislation  is  very  stringent</span><span>  against  their  being  abused  in  any  way.</span><span>  Their  time  or  tasks  are  allotted  them,</span><span>  and  when  work  is  over  they  are  free  to</span><span>  cultivate  their  little  vegetable  gardens,</span><span>  and  look  after  their  poultry  and  goats.</span><span>  Finding  in  these  pursuits,  and  in  the</span><span>  companionship  of  their  countrymen,</span><span>  ample  occupation,  amusement,  and</span><span>  entertainment  they  mingle  very  little</span><span>  with  white  people.  Intercourse  between</span></p> <p><span>  the  sexes  of  different  races  is  un-</span><span>  known  where  Coolies  are  located,</span><span>  and  with  them  instead  of  Kanakas  as</span><span>  labourers,  we  should  not  have  ""  scrub</span><span>  settlements  ""  near  our  town,  and  a  semi</span><span>  barbarous  race  growing  up  in  our  midst.</span><span>  Then,  their  only  occupation  is  agricul-</span><span>  ture.  For  that  they  are  engaged  :  to</span><span>  lh.it  they  are  confined.  Not  till  they</span><span>  have  been  ten  years  in  the  Wwi  Indies</span><span>  are  they  free  to  remain  there,  The  fact</span></p> <p><span>  is,  however,  they  do  not  settle  down  io</span><span>  strange  lands.  As  soon  as  they  have</span><span>  made  a  little  money  they  return  to  their,</span><span>  native  villages,  acquire  land,  and  become</span><span>  tyots,  or  farmers  on  their  own  account.</span><span>  Neither  temporarily  nor  permanently  do</span><span>  they  interfere  with  white  labour.  As  for</span><span>  for  their  becoming  mechanics  and  trades-</span><span>  men-such  a  thing  has  not  been  heard</span><span>  of.  Instead  of  depreciating  white  labour</span><span>  their  presence  creates  the  demand  for</span><span>  and  makes  it  valuable.  Managers,  sub</span><span>  managers,  field-inspectors  -  all  are</span><span>  Europeans,  and  the  Coolies  would  rather</span><span>  have  them  as  any  other.  There  is  one</span><span>  point  not  touched  upon  in  the  correspon-</span><span>  dence,  but  upon  which  the  Doctor  is</span><span>  eloquent  in  conversation,  and  that  is</span><span>  the  circulation  of  money  caused  by</span><span>  their  presence  in  a  community.</span><span>  Their  rations,  tools,  and  numerous  little</span><span>  requirements  necessitate  constant  ex-</span><span>  penditure  on  the  part  of  their  employers.</span><span>  The  Coolies  themselves  are  also  given</span><span>  to  finery,  and,  from  their  scanty  earnings,</span><span>  treat  their  dusky  mates  to  something  new</span><span>  and  attractive  in  the  way  of  dress.  Dr.</span><span>  Cunningham  is  very  decidedly  of  opinion,</span></p> <p><span>  that  the  introduction  of  Coolies  into</span></p> <p><span>  Queensland  would  not  be  detrimental</span><span>  to  the  moral,  social,  and  material  interests</span><span>  of  the  Colony.  He  is  not  troubled  with</span><span>  the  fear,  conjured  up  in  many  minds  by</span><span>  Opposition  orators,  that  this  Colony</span><span>  shall  become  of  an  Asiatic  type,  with  two</span><span>  grades  of  inhabitants,  one  being  bloated</span><span>  white  aristocrats,  and  the  other  mean</span><span>  whites  and  Coolies.  The  prospect  of</span><span>  such  a  thing  is  so  remote  that  it  gives</span><span>  Dr.  Cunningham  no  concern.  His</span><span>  answer  to  the  last  question  submitted</span><span>  brings  us  back  to  the  point  with  which  we</span><span>  had  to  deal  at  the  opening  of  this  article.</span><span>  We  have  the  soil  and  the  climate,  but,</span><span>  our  correspondent  says,  unless  we</span><span>  have  cheap  labour  he  does  not</span><span>  think  it  possible  we  shall  be</span><span>  able  to  compete  successfully  in  the  cul-</span><span>  tivation  of  sugar,  &c.  with  other  countries</span><span>  where  it  is  obtaiguble.  His  'opinion  has</span><span>  been  formed  after  communication  and</span><span>  conversation  with  those  who  have  wit-</span><span>  nessed  attempts  made  without  success.</span><span>  It  seems  to  us  that,  when  the  time  comes</span><span>  for  the  constituencies.  to  decide  this</span><span>  matter,  they  will  follow  the  course  their</span><span>  interests  demands,  and  not  oppose  the</span><span>  introduction  of  Coolies.  imperial</span><span>  statutes  provide  they  shall  only  be</span><span>  introduced  under  stringent  regulations</span><span>  as  to  their  treatment  and  maintenance,</span><span>  so  that  nothing  like  slavery  shall  ever</span><span>  appear  in  our  midst;  and  the  present</span><span>  Queensland  Government  have  declared</span><span>  that  they  shall  only  be  employed  in</span><span>  tropical  agriculture,  and  thus  they  shall</span><span>  not  keep  down  white  men's  wages.</span><span>  Unless,  therefore  our  infant  sugar  industry</span><span>  is  to  be  maimed,  so  that  it  shall  not  be</span><span>  able  to  progress  for  a  century  or  more,</span><span>  we  ,must  have  Coolies.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  hare  received  an  interesting  letter  from</span><span>  Mr.  W,  H.  Robison  on  the  Sugar  Industry,</span><span>  but  ita  length  and  pressures  on  our  space</span><span>  compel  us  to  reserve  its  publication  till</span><span>  Monday.</span></p> <p><span>  OSE  of  onr  readers  says  that  he  bas  been</span><span>  waiting  all  the  week  in  expectation  that  some</span><span>  one  would  reply  to  our  paragraph  on  tho  ad</span><span>  vico  of  tho  Wesleyan  Conference  in  reference</span><span>  to  attending  theatres,  &c*  He  is  somewhat</span><span>  pleased  with  the  paragraph  in  yesterday's</span><span>  Bulletin  ou  ""gaiety  tempered  by  seriousness  ""</span><span>  still  ho  thinks  that  more  ought  to  be  said,  and</span><span>  asks  us  to  write  an  essay  on  Romaus  12,  I  and</span><span>  2,  ""I  beseech  you  therefore  brethren,  by  the</span><span>  mercieB  of  God  that  yo  present  your  bodies  a</span><span>  living  sacrifice,  holy,  acceptable  unto  God</span><span>  which  is  your  reasonable  service.  And  bc  not</span><span>  oonformed  to  this  world;  but  be  ye  trans-</span><span>  formed  by  the  renewing  of  your  mind,  that  ye</span><span>  may  prove  what  is  that  good,  nud  acceptable,</span><span>  and  perfect  will  of  God.""  He  thinks  that</span><span>  there  ought  to  be  a  difference  between  the</span><span>  church  and  the  world,  tho  line  should  be</span><span>  drawn  somewhere,  but  a  Minister  with  whom</span><span>  he  was  talking  some  time  ago,  said  he  waB</span><span>  afraid  it  was  rubbed  out,</span></p> <p><span>  ?favos  the  invitation  of  Mr,  R.  Ross,  Taran</span></p> <p><span>  ganbah,  and  Mr.  James  Ross,  Mulambin,  Mr.</span><span>  Maodonald,  manager  Pandora  Sugar  Planta-</span><span>  tion,  on  Thursday,  visited  the  coast  areas  of</span><span>  the  above-named  gentlemeu's  runs.  He  found</span><span>  many  patches,  about  400  and  500  acres  in</span><span>  extent,  where  the  Boil  was  admirably  adapted</span><span>  for  sugar-cane.  As  many  of  our  readers</span><span>  aro  aware  the  country  has  a  fine  ex-</span><span>  posure  to  thc  north-east,  ÍB  well  sheltered</span><span>  by  the  Berserker  Range  from  the  cold  west</span><span>  winds,  and  slopes  gently  towards  the  beach.</span><span>  Ross's  Creek  would  naturally  form  the  port  of</span><span>  tho  plantations  that  may  be  formed  there,</span><span>  and  it  would  be  fouud  very  suitable  and  con</span><span>  convenient.  Accompanied  by  Mr.  Broome,</span><span>  Mr.  Macdonald  also  visited  the  proposed</span><span>  plantation  on  Woodlands  run.  He  ex-</span><span>  presses  himself  as  highly  pleased  with</span><span>  the  appearance  of  the  cane  there.</span><span>  The  earliest  plauted  cane,  which  by</span><span>  the  way,  is  ten,  and  not  six  montliB  old,  as</span><span>  we  stated  thc  other  day,  he  regards  aB  very</span><span>  superior  in  all  respects.  With  the  whole</span><span>  patch  he  was  very  much  pleased.  With</span><span>  regard  to  the  land,  he  says  lie  has  not  seen</span><span>  better  anywhere  in  the  colony.  Looking  to</span><span>  tho  soil,  situation,  permanent  water  supply,</span><span>  &c,  he  has  not  the  least  doubt  a  flourishing</span><span>  plantation  may  be  established.  Mr.  Mac-</span><span>  donald  proceeds  to  Brisbane  to-day,  and  will</span><span>  return  in  a  short  time  to  take  charge  of</span><span>  Pandora  Plantation,  and  superintend  thc</span><span>  erection  on  the  site  for  the  crushing  machinery,</span><span>  which  has  been  ordered  from  England.</span></p> <p><span>  RESPECTING  tho  French  arrivals  who  were</span></p> <p><span>  relegated  to  durance  vile  yesterday,  wb  learn</span><span>  that  thc  fifth  man  Geffroy  states,  be  hired  the</span><span>  boat  in  which  lie  and  his  companions</span><span>  embarked  on  their  perilous  journey.  They</span><span>  Iud  a  rapilal  of  eighty  francs,  to  purchase</span><span>  their  outfit.  Among  tho  provisious  were  three</span><span>  buttles  of  ruui,  which  lasted  twelve  days.</span><span>  When  the  boat  struck  ou  a  rock,  as</span><span>  previously  mentioned,  Pulin  was  steering</span><span>  the  craft,  and  the  tiller  swung  round</span><span>  and  severely  iujured  a  rib  :  the  effects</span><span>  of  the  injury  he  still  feels.  Tho  boat</span><span>  was  a  whaleboat,  thirty  feet  long,  four  feet</span><span>  deep,  and  ten  foot  beam.  When  she  struck</span><span>  the  keel  was  completely  smashed.  Gulh-oy</span><span>  describes  himself  aa  a  lirickmaker,  and  waa</span></p> <p><span>  employed  by  linux,  a  butcher.  Ile  says  his</span><span>  employer  owod  him  money,  and  as  he  could</span><span>  not  get  it,  he  attempted  to  steal  a  watch</span><span>  from  him.  With  this  intent  he  opened  his</span><span>  employes  bedroom  door  by  means  of  a  key,</span><span>  and  while  attempting  the  theft  was  caught  by</span><span>  Kons.  For  this  he  received  a  eenteuce  of</span><span>  eight  years'  imprisonment  aud  was  sent  to</span><span>  New  Caledonia.  He  was  highly  indignant</span><span>  nt  being  arrested  as  a  vagrant,  as  he  thought</span><span>  England  was  n  free  country.  He  understood</span><span>  that  after  finishing  his  term'  he  was  not</span><span>  a  rogue,  and  would  get  employment  on</span><span>  landing.  Ile  said  Mr.  Carden  Collins  was</span><span>  willing  to  engage  him  as  a  labourer,  and  had</span><span>  supplied  him  with  money.  I  he  other  men</span><span>  took  the  decision  of  the  P.M.  in  a  quiet</span><span>  manner,  on  Mr.  Martiu  telling  them  from  the</span><span>  Hench  that  tht-ir  explanations  would  better</span><span>  bonefit  them  in  Brisbane,  to  which  place  they</span><span>  would  be  sent.</span></p> <p><span>  BETÖRE  (he  Police  Magistrate  yesterday</span><span>  morning,  a  drunkard  was  cautioned  and  dis-</span><span>  charged.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  JUNE  19,  1883,</span></p> <p><span>  THE  tug  of  war  begins  on  this  day  week  ;</span><span>  and  a  stout  fight  it  will  certainly  be.</span><span>  If  will  present  a  grand  opportunity  for</span><span>  the  leading  men  to  exhibit  their  prowess,</span><span>  although  the  result  of  the  stuggle  seems</span><span>  to  be  a  foregone  conclusion.  And  then</span><span>  will  come  in  the  weak-kneed  members,</span><span>  and  the  waiters  upon  Providence.  They</span><span>  of  course  will  have  to  waste  some  public</span><span>  time  in  setting  themselves  right  with</span><span>  their  constituents.  There  will  be  a</span><span>  perfect  babel  of  tongues  for  a  fortnight,</span><span>  when,  if  Ministers  carry  out  their  inten-</span><span>  tion  to  stand  firm,  there  will  be  a  sudden</span><span>  lull  before  the  electoral  storm.  Only</span><span>  one  contingency  could  save  the  Govcn</span><span>  nicnt.  Tliey  cannot  themselves  draw</span><span>  back,  bul  it  seems  just  possible  that  the</span><span>  Transcontinental  Railway  Syndicate,  if</span><span>  assured  that  the  validating  bill  will  »ot</span><span>  pass,  may  do  so.  We  say  may,  though  such</span><span>  a  step  seems  highly  impossible.  There</span><span>  can  be  no  question  but  the  Syndicate</span></p> <p><span>  are  in  earnest,  and  actuated  by  honour-  J</span><span>  able  motives.  To  withdraw  would</span><span>  therefore  be  to  show  the  white  feather,</span></p> <p><span>  and  in  doing  so  to  invite  abuse,  both</span><span>  upon  the  members  of  the  Syndicate  and</span><span>  the  members  of  the  Government</span></p> <p><span>  Still  the  rejection  of  the  agreement</span><span>  would  not  settle  the  question  ol  land</span><span>  grant  railways.  On  the  contrary  it</span><span>  would  quickly  bring  our  politicians  face</span><span>  to  face  with  the  hitherto  insoluble  land</span></p> <p><span>  and  public  works  questions.  If  the</span><span>  Opposition  will  not  have  land-grant</span><span>  railways  they  must  suggest  something</span><span>  else.  Then  they  will  find  that  although</span><span>  a  fool  may  destroy  it  needs  a  wise  man</span><span>  to-build  up.  Possibly  Mr.  Griffith  has</span><span>  some  statesmanlike  scheme  in  his  in-</span></p> <p><span>  genious  head  which  will  secure  the  ap-</span><span>  proval  of  a  majority  in  Parliament,  and</span><span>  carry  the  ship  of  State  safely  into  deep</span><span>  water.  Or  possibly  that  honorable</span><span>  gentleman's  wisdom  will  be  found  to</span><span>  consist,  like  that  of  the  owl,  simply  in</span><span>  his  looks.  He  is  attempting  to  look</span><span>  very  wise  at  present,  at  any  rate.  He</span><span>  does  not  mean  to  slacken  the  construc-</span><span>  tion  of  public  works,  or  injure  the  sugar</span><span>  industry,  but  he  is  adopting  the  most</span><span>  effective  apparent  method  of  doing  both.</span><span>  The  truth  is,  we  suspect,  that  if  the  con-</span><span>  stituencies  can  but  be  induced  to  let  the</span><span>  Opposition  into  power  they  will  do  as</span><span>  they  did  io  1876-7,  coolly  reverse  their</span><span>  opinions  with  their  coats,  and  appro-</span><span>  priate  the  policy  of  their  predecessors.</span><span>  In  1876  the  Thorn  Ministry  went  to</span><span>  their  constituents  with  a  policy  of  rest</span><span>  and  caution.  But  once  returned  they</span><span>  met  Parliament  with  a  policy  of  six  new</span><span>  railways  in  a  block.  They  went  to  the</span><span>  country  with  promises  to  unlock  the</span><span>  lands  for  the  benefit  of  the  selecting</span><span>  class.  They  relurned  to  Parliament</span><span>  with  a  scheme  for  the  wholesale  aliena-</span><span>  tion  of  the  public  lands  to  large</span><span>  capitalists.  History  repeats  itself;  and</span><span>  so  when  Mr.  Griffith  says  that  the  sugar</span><span>  industry  will  not  die,  even  though  it  be</span><span>  deprived  of  suitable  labour,  he  means</span><span>  that  if  he  comes  into  power  he  will</span><span>  admit  Coolie  or  any  other  labour-if  he</span><span>  finds  that  the  exigencies  of  the  times</span></p> <p><span>  demand  it.</span></p> <p><span>  What  a  contrast  is  furnished  by  Sir  j</span><span>  Thomas  M'llwraith's  speech  as  delivered  I</span><span>  at  Dalby,  to  that'delivered  by  Mr.  Griffith</span><span>  at  Mackay  last  week.  On  the  one  hand</span><span>  the  colony  is  furnished  with  a  clear  and</span><span>  definite  line  of  policy,  which  shows  at</span><span>  least  a  statesmanlike  appreciation  of  the</span><span>  wants  of  the  colony,  and  the  glorious</span><span>  future  which  lies  before  it.  On  the</span><span>  other  we  have  a  policy  of  negations</span><span>  and  evasions.  ""  I  will  be  your</span><span>  physician,""  says  the  Opposition  leader,</span><span>  ""  but  I  will  not  prescribe  until</span><span>  I  am  called  in.  I  must  have  my  fee</span><span>  before  I  feel  your  pulse.  Give  me</span><span>  security  for  ^1300  a  year,  and  I  will</span><span>  prescribe  for  and  cure  you  of  your  com-</span><span>  plaint.  You  ask  my  qualifications?</span><span>  Well,  I  am  an  accomplished  lawyer,  and</span><span>  a  cutting  parliamentary  critic.  I  know,</span><span>  '  although  you  may  not,  that  I  am  also  a</span></p> <p><span>  first-class  statesman.  You  must  take  me</span><span>  at  ray  own  valuation  or  not  at  all.  That</span><span>  I  was  a  grotesque  failure  as  Minister  for</span><span>  Works  in  1878  does  not  prove  I</span><span>  shall  not  be  a  brilliant  success  in</span><span>  1883.  Nor  does  the  fact,  that  I</span><span>  1  have  been  a  very  poor  Opposition</span><span>  1  leader,  prove  that  I  shall  not  be</span></p> <p><span>  .  a  .  very-,-1-1-i-j^,.  vr  tire</span></p> <p><span>  ¡  prospective  coalition  government-a</span></p> <p><span>  coalition  comprised  of  the  rump  of  the</span><span>  '  squatters  with  the  tail  ol  the  Radicals.</span><span>  ;  I  will  give  you  all  you  want,  if</span><span>  ,  you  will  but  first  help  me  to  vanquish</span><span>  '  the  M'llwraith  Government,  who  have</span></p> <p><span>  had  their  innings  and  their  full  share  of</span><span>  the  victor's  spoils.""</span></p> <p><span>  We  put  it  to  our  readers  whether  or  not</span><span>  this  is  the  proper  attitude  for  a  political</span></p> <p><span>  leader  to  assume.  Sir  Robert  Feel  is</span><span>  Mr.  Griffith's  authority  for  refusing  to</span><span>  prescribe,  but  is  an  English  Tory  Minister</span><span>  of  fifty  years  ago,  speaking  to  a  House</span><span>  of  Commons  composed  almost  entirely  of</span><span>  representatives  of  the  privileged  classes</span><span>  -is  such  a  Minister  the  model</span><span>  up  to  which  the  Queensland  Liberal</span><span>  works  ?  Fifty  years  ago  the  masses  of</span><span>  the  people  had  no  voice  in  the  British</span><span>  House  of  Commons  ;  to-day  the  people</span><span>  of  Queensland,  enfranchised  with  univer-</span><span>  sal  suffrage,  make  or  unmake  parties  in</span><span>  our  representative  Legislature.  We  say,</span><span>  then,  it  is  an  insult  to  the  people  for  a</span><span>  political  leader  to  seek  to  palm  himself</span><span>  off  as  the  physician  whose  advice  shall</span><span>  not  be  given  until  he  is  called  in.</span></p> <p><span>  While  disclaiming  any  wish  to</span><span>  keep  any  set  of  men  perpetually</span><span>  in  office,  we  therefore  contend  that</span><span>  the  constituencies  should  require  from</span><span>  every  candidate  a  distinct  and  unequi-</span></p> <p><span>  vocal  confession  of  his  faith.  If  he</span><span>  does  not  believe  in  thc  Transcontinental</span><span>  Railway,  does  he  believe  in  unlimited</span><span>  borrowing  and  increased  taxation  to  pay</span><span>  the  ever-accumulating  interest  on  the</span><span>  public  debt?  Or  does  he  believe  in</span><span>  putting  a  stop  to  public  works  ?  Or  in</span><span>  destroying  the  sugar  and  engineering</span><span>  industries.  It  may  be  all  very  well  for</span><span>  lawyers  lo  say  that  sugar  can  be  pro-</span><span>  fitably  grown  with  white  labour  :  but</span><span>  that  is  not  the  opinion  of  sugar  growers</span><span>  to  the  contrary  effect  which  is  very</span></p> <p><span>  much  more  valuable?</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  meeting  of  the  Council  of  the  Royal</span><span>  Colonial  Institute  held  on  the  24th  April,  Mr.</span><span>  John  Steveneon,  M.L.A.,  Queensland,  was</span><span>  elected  a  Fellow.</span></p> <p><span>  AN  advertisement  elsewhere  states  that  the</span><span>  partnership  subsisting  for  some  time  past,</span><span>  between  Messrs,  O'Xlourke  and  M'Sharry,</span><span>  railway  contractors,  is  formally  dissolved.</span><span>  This  step  is  owing,  it  is  understood,  to  thc</span><span>  advent  in  thc  finn  of  Mr.  Macrossan.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Government  Gaz'lte  of  last  Saturday</span><span>  notifies  that  Sergeant  Patrick  Bowen  ia  ap-</span><span>  pointed  inspector  of  slaughter  houses,  and  of</span><span>  cattle  to  be  slaughtered  at  Bogantungan  and</span><span>  Clermont  ;  Bernard  Mullen,  H.  lt.

The</span><span>  country  between  Comet  and  Springsure  shows</span><span>  signs  of  a  scarcity  of  moisture,  and  Rainworth</span><span>  Station  requires  rain.  Orass  feed  is  plentiful</span><span>  all  along  the  road,  but  the  creeks  are</span><span>  bare  of  water,  Generally  speaking  tho  season</span><span>  is  likely  to  provo  favourable.

The</span><span>  oasc  was  brouiht  by  the  Hairdressers'</span><span>  Association.  Mr.  Pinnock  said  he  and  his</span><span>  brother  magistrates  considered  that  the  Hair-</span><span>  dressers'  Association  vero  trying  to  make  the</span><span>  Police  Court  a  vehicle  by  which  they  could</span><span>  enforce  their  own  regulations.  The  bench</span><span>  were  of  opinion  that  thia  was  not  the  correct</span><span>  thing  to  do.  The  Act  bad  been  passed  to</span><span>  causo  thc  Lord's  Day  to  be  observed,  Tbs</span><span>  bench  also  considered  it  very  hard  if  a  person,</span><span>  who  probably  arrived  in  town  from  the  bush</span><span>  too  late  on  Saturday  night  to  go  to  a  barber's</span><span>  shop,  could  not  get  a  Bhave  on  Sunday.  If  the</span><span>  bench  bad  the  power  thoy  would  have  dis-</span><span>  missed  the  case,  or  only  inflicted  thc  fiuo  of  a</span><span>  farthing,  but  as  it  waa  they  had  no  option  but</span><span>  to  inflict  a  penalty.  They  hoped  that  tlioy</span><span>  would  have  to  deal  with  no  more  prosecutions</span><span>  by  tho  association.</span></p> <p><span>  FROM  tho  Brisbane  Courier  we  observe  that</span><span>  a  printer's  apprentice  named  Patrick  Ambrose</span><span>  Bree,  bas  been  trying  to  free  himself  from  his</span><span>  indentures  by  summoning  Robert  William</span><span>  Bermingham,  for  neglecting  to  properly</span><span>  instruct  him  in  the  art  of  printing.  The</span><span>  evidence  showed  that  on  tho  lat  July,  1S80,</span><span>  complainant  had  entered  into  indentures  with</span><span>  defendant  to  serve  for  seven  years,  in  order</span><span>  that  bc  might  learn  tho  art  of  printing.  Tho</span><span>  case  was  dismissed,  as  the  testimony  adduced</span><span>  in  support  of  tho  charge  showed  that  the</span><span>  complainant  was  fairly  advanced  in  the  busi-</span><span>  ness  for  tho  two  years  and  a-half  bc  bad  been</span><span>  serving,  and  that  in  four  years  bonce  he  would</span><span>  thoroughly  acquiro  the  art.

Several  cases  of  thc</span><span>  kind  had  been  brought  before  him  lately,  and,</span><span>  as  he  had  repeatedly  said,  they  were  casting</span><span>  to  the  winda  the  opportunities  they  had  of</span></p> <p><span>  earning  an  honest  livelihood,  and  gaining</span><span>  independence  for  themselves.

The  most  of</span><span>  VeBterday  was  occupied  in  arranging  the  stalls,</span><span>  and  st  three  o'clock  in  tue  afternoon</span><span>  the  sale  waa  opened.

"<p><span>  KOCKIIAMt'TON</span></p> <p><span>  SATUUDAY.  JULY  28,  18S3.</span></p> <p><span>  ALL  who  arc  interested  in  the  social</span><span>  welfare  of  the  people  will  read  with  more</span><span>  than  ordinary  attention  the  progress</span><span>  report,  which  has  hecn  drawn  up  by  the</span><span>  Royal  Commission  on  Employees  in</span><span>  Shops,  and  which  has  been  published  in</span><span>  the  Melbourne  daily  newspapers.  It  is</span><span>  a  most  instructive  document,  and  deals</span><span>  concisely  and  practically  with  the  impor-</span><span>  tant  points  of  the  Karly  Ciosing  Question.</span><span>  The  conclusion  to  which  the  Com-</span><span>  missioners  have  come,  after  hearing  a</span><span>  large  amount  of  evidence  from  both</span><span>  employers  and  employed,  is  that  early</span></p> <p><span>  closing  should  be  established  by  Act  of</span><span>  Parliament  j  and  that  this  object  can</span><span>  be  best  ;  accomplished  by  fixing  the</span><span>  bouts  in.  an  y  one  week  during  which</span><span>  employes'  shall  be  called  to  labour,</span><span>  leaving  to-^employers  and  employes  the</span><span>  allocation  of  those  hours,  provided  thal</span></p> <p><span>  the  number  shall  not  exceed  forty-eight</span><span>  in  one  week.  It  will  thus  be  seen  thal</span><span>  after  '  táking  eviflfencrí  oh  the'  whole</span><span>  matter,  and  considering  it  fully  thc</span><span>  Commissioners  have  ho  faith  in  moral</span><span>  moral  suasion.  However  much  some</span></p> <p><span>  of  our  readers  may  be  inclined  to</span><span>  dissent  from  this  finding,  upon  reading</span><span>  the  report  they  will  readily  admit  that  it</span><span>  is  warranted.  When  men  increase</span><span>  in  number  in  any  centre  bf  civilisa-</span><span>  tion,  not  only  do  the  rich  be-</span><span>  come  more  wealthy,  and  the  poor</span><span>  more'  abjectly  miserable;  but  the</span><span>  wealthy  become  more  powerful,'and  the</span><span>  poor  weaker.  It  is  the  unrestrained</span><span>  domination  of  wealth,  and  the  gratifica-</span><span>  tion  of  the  passion  to  acquire  it,  which</span><span>  have  called  forth  this  demand  for  the</span><span>  legislature  to  interfere  on  behalf  of</span><span>  those  whose  only  wealth  is  their  ability</span><span>  to  toil.  The  prominent  fact  pointed  but</span><span>  in  this  report,  is  that,  in  the'eily  of</span><span>  Melbourne,  there  are  20,000  persons  who</span><span>  are  subject  to  grievous  hardships,  and</span><span>  who  live  under  a  system  of  forced  labour</span><span>  repugnant  to  every  sense  of  justice  and</span><span>  humanity.  Hundreds  of  young  girls,  we</span><span>  are  told,  are  employed  at  work  daily</span><span>  from  ten  lo  fifteen  hours,  under  such  in-</span><span>  sanitary  conditions  that  their  health  in</span><span>  many  cases  has  become  completely</span></p> <p><span>  undermined.  !</span></p> <p><span>  Among  the  discoveries  made  by  the</span><span>  Commissioners  was  the  complete  failure</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  efforts  made  to  ameliorate  the</span></p> <p><span>  condition'  of  the  employees  by  moral</span></p> <p><span>  suasion.  Attempts  were  made  to  -</span><span>  produce  a  change  by  such  means.  An</span><span>  Early  'Closing  Association  wás  formed,</span><span>  appeals  were  made  through  the  press,</span><span>  lectures  were  delivered,  entertainments</span><span>  were  organised-in  fact  all  the  agents  of</span><span>  moral  suasion  were  set  in  motion,  to</span><span>  induce  the  public  to  co-operate  in1</span></p> <p><span>  the  tcduclion  of  the  hours  of</span></p> <p><span>  labour  in  shops.  The  larger  drapery</span><span>  establishments  agreed  to  close  at</span><span>  six  o'clock'  daily,  and  on  Saturday</span><span>  afternoons;  but  the  smaller  and  suburban</span><span>  establishments  never  cordially  -concurred</span><span>  in  the  arrangement,  and  so  far  as  they</span><span>  were  concerned  it  fell  through.  A  Sales-</span><span>  men  and  Assistants'  Union  was  formed</span><span>  to  take  up  the  cause  which  had  been</span><span>  abandoned  hythe  Early  Closing  Associa-</span><span>  tion.  The  former  set:  the  engines  of</span><span>  moral  suasion  in  motion,  and  spent</span></p> <p><span>  ¿£300  in  working  them.  A  newspaper  j</span><span>  was  run  in  the  interests  of  the  early  !</span><span>  closers,  and  bills  and  advertisements</span><span>  widely  circulated.  At  last  the  efforts  of</span><span>  the  Union  seemed  to  be  crowned  with</span><span>  some  measure  of  success,  and  it  was</span><span>  generally  agreed  the  shops  should  be</span><span>  shut  at  seven  o'clock  ;  but  a  few  indi-</span><span>  viduals  held  our,  and  those  weak  links</span><span>  in  the  chain,  caused  by  local  and  personal</span><span>  jealousies,  and  a  spirit  of  competiou,  led</span><span>  to  the,  collapse  of  the  movement.  In</span><span>  Ballarat/  Sandhurst,  and  Geelong  the</span><span>  shops  close  daily  at  six,  at  ten  on  Satur-</span></p> <p><span>  day,  and  one  half-day  in  the  week  ;  but  in  1</span></p> <p><span>  Melbourne  and  suburbs  the  long  hour  j</span></p> <p><span>  system  still  obtains.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  grounds  of  expediency,  justice,</span><span>  and  humanity  the  employees,  having</span><span>  exhausted  the  powers  of  moral  suasion,</span><span>  now  demand  legislative  interference  for</span><span>  their  protection.  It  is  expedient,  they</span><span>  contend,  ""  because  it  is  the  youth  of</span><span>  both  sexes-the  flower  of  the  population</span></p> <p><span>  -that  suffers  most  from  the  effect  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  system  that  prevails  ;  it  is  simple  justice</span></p> <p><span>  to  secure  tor  them  the  curtailment  of  the</span><span>  hours  of  labour,  inasmuch  as  tradesmen</span><span>  for  the  greater  part  enjoy  the  blessing  of</span><span>  the  eight  hours  movement  ;  it  is  in  the</span><span>  interests  of  humanity,  because  pf  the</span><span>  tender,  age  of  the  workers,  the  character</span><span>  of  the  climate,  and  the  defective</span><span>  hygienic  arrangements  of  many  work-</span><span>  shops  and  places  of  business.""  In</span><span>  support  of  these  contentions  the  Commis-</span><span>  sioners  point  out  that  a  limitation  of  the</span><span>  hours  of  labour  does  not  lead  to  a</span></p> <p><span>  decrease  of  business.  Experience,  has</span></p> <p><span>  shown  that  where  the  hours  have  been</span><span>  reduced,  the.  same  amount  of  business</span><span>  has  been  done.  The  same  business,</span><span>  they  assert,  can  be  done  as  effectually  in</span><span>  eight  hours  as  in  twelve  or  fourteen.</span></p> <p><span>  Strange  as  it  may  seem,  most  of  the</span><span>  employers  are  as  anxious'  as  their  em-</span><span>  ployes  to  enjoy  the  benefits  arising  from</span><span>  early  closing.  The  proprietors  of  large</span></p> <p><span>  establishments  are  unanimous  on  the</span><span>  subject.  Among  the  smaller  shokeepers</span><span>  an  active  rivalry  in  business  is  the  chief</span><span>  obstacle  to  harmony.  They  are  quite</span><span>  conscious  that  the  long  hours  are</span><span>  injurious  to  health,  and  are  wholly</span><span>  unnecessary,  but  they  persist  in  them  as</span></p> <p><span>  a  matter  of  self-defence.  A  few  talk  of</span><span>  the  restriction  of  the  hours  of  business</span><span>  as  interference  with  the  rights  of  the</span><span>  subject,  and  contend  that  late  hours  are</span><span>  necessary  to  suit  the  requirements  and</span><span>  and  convenience  of  the  working  classes.</span><span>  The  position  of  this  class  of  objectors,</span><span>  the  Commissioners  maintain,  is  wholly</span><span>  ?untenable,  and  their  arguments  are  based</span></p> <p><span>  on  self-interest  and  indifference  to  the</span><span>  health  and  comfort  of  their  employees.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Commissioners  have  accumulated</span><span>  a  large  amount  of  evidence  upon  the</span><span>  injurious  effects-physically,  mentally,</span><span>  and  morally-of  protracted  labour  in</span><span>  shops.  It  is  painful  to  read  of.  the</span><span>  mortality  which  prevails  among  shop-</span><span>  men.  Few  of  them,  who  do  not  get</span><span>  into  business  for  themselves,  live  beyond</span><span>  thirty-five  or  forty.  Fine  robust  young</span><span>  men  go  in  from  the  country,  and  long</span><span>  before  they  reach  middle  life,  shop-work</span><span>  has  broken  them  down,  ""  so  that  they</span><span>  are  unlit  fur  anything.""  Medical  testi-</span><span>  mony  is  also  adduced,  and  is  most</span><span>  convincing  as  to  the  evils  of  long  hours,</span><span>  especially  on  the  health  of  the  young</span><span>  women,  and  that  of  barmaids.

It  is  most  likely  legislative</span><span>  action  will  follow  upon  it.  The  com-</span><span>  munity  of  Rockahmpton  is  to  be  con-</span><span>  gratulated,  we  think,  on  the  fact  that</span><span>  legal  compulsion  is  not  necessary  among</span><span>  our  shopkeepers.</span></p> <p><span>  OPKjtiTipsa  wjll  -be  cammeboei-  at  the</span><span>  Lake's  Creek  Woács  oh  tba  K¡tb&lt;inBtant  to</span><span>  preps  ra  f  rosen  meat  for  £he  Fiado,  which  is  .to</span><span>  be  loaded  lhere  eatjy  iufieptomber.</span></p> <p><span>  TUB  Ooseftwr  say»  r-The  Fitzroy  frozen</span><span>  meat  works  arc  the  most  complete  in  thc</span><span>  colonies,  and  that  the  trade  initiated  by  tho</span><span>  Fiado  between  Brisbane  aud  Java  will,  in</span><span>  consequence.&lt;jf  thc  med!-.ency  of  the  Queens</span><span>  I  port  works,Ac  u'oucctbi  th  carried  on  between</span></p> <p><span>  KockUainptou  aud  Java.</span></p> <p><span>  I  IN  consequence  of  the  congrégation,  ol</span></p> <p><span>  Fitzroy-strcet  Primitive  Methodist  Church,</span><span>  and  the  number  of  cliildren  who  attend  the</span><span>  Sunday  School  being,  on  the  increase,  it  has</span><span>  become  necessary  to  enlargo  the  place  of</span><span>  worship.

The  first  set,  consisting  of  ten</span><span>  elections,  took  place  on  the  17th  instant,  and</span><span>  resulted  in  a  gain  of  one  to  the  Opposition.</span><span>  Aubigny.  Blackall,  Dalby,  Mackay,  Mul-</span><span>  grave,  Normanby,  Port  Curtis,  and  Hock</span><span>  hatnpton  retained  their  old  representatives,</span><span>  except  that  Mr.  Higson  succeeded  Mr.  T.  M.</span><span>  Paterson.  In  tho  Logan  electorate  Mr.  P.</span><span>  M'Leau,  Minister  for  Lauds  in  thc  Douglas</span><span>  Administration,  has  been  ousted  by  Mr.  ti.</span><span>  J.  Stevens,  Ministerialist.  At  Maryborough</span><span>  the  Ministerial  candidates  have  becu  succeeded</span><span>  hy  Mr.  Hurley,  who  claims  to  be  Independent,</span><span>  and  Mr.  Sheridan,  an  Oppositionist.  Thc</span><span>  polling  for  thc  second  set  of  eight  elections</span><span>  took  place  on  the  21st  inslaut.  Enoggera</span><span>  returned  Messrs.  J.  lt.  Dickson  and  J.  L.</span><span>  Bale;  Oxley,  Mr.  S.  Crimes  ;  Rosewood,  Mr.</span><span>  J.  B.  L.  Isambert;  Bundanha,  Mr.  Foote</span><span>  -without  opposition.  Contests  took  place</span><span>  in  thc  Valley,  Brisbane  ;  South  Brisbane,</span><span>  Ipswich,  and  North  Brisbane,  but  the  only</span><span>  change  made  iu  tho  state  of  parties  was  the</span><span>  rejection  of  Mr.  Kingsford,  and  thc  substitution</span><span>  ol  Mr.  Jordan  in  South  Brisbane.  In  these</span></p> <p><span>  clcctious  an  attack  was  made  ou  thc  Opposi-</span><span>  tion  stronghold,  but  it  failed.  Thc  polling</span><span>  for  thc  third  set  of  three  elections  was  fixed</span><span>  for  Toursday  last.  Bowen  returned  Mr.</span><span>  Chubb  without  oppositiou.  In  the  Luicli</span></p> <p><span>  I  hardt  electorate  Messrs.  Scott  and  Dutton</span></p> <p><span>  have  been  returned,  the  latter  gentleman</span><span>  supplanting  Mr.  Feiss.  In  Stanley  electorate</span><span>  the  Opposition  candidates  have  both  buen  re-</span><span>  turned,  and  Mr.  P.  O'Sullivan  has  lost  his</span><span>  Bent.  Nominations  for  the  fourth  set  of</span><span>  elections  took  place  yesterday,  when  Mr.</span><span>  I  (Jarrick  was  returned  for  Moreton  with-</span></p> <p><span>  out  opposition.  Thc  results  of  thu  elec-</span><span>  tions  so  far  have  liccn  that  thc  Ministry</span><span>  have  gained  ono  scat  -  Logan  -  and</span><span>  have  lost  four-Maryborough  (2),  Stanley,</span><span>  and  Leichhardt.  Thc  Opposition  have  n&lt;  !.</span><span>  been  more  successful  in  thur  attacks  on  thc</span><span>  Ministerial  positions  than  thc  latter.  With</span><span>  the  exception  of  Mr.  Ohubb'a  all  the  Minis-</span><span>  terial  seats  were  challenged.  At  Aubigny  a</span><span>  fierce  assault  was  made  on  Hon.  P.  Perkius'</span></p> <p><span>  seat,  but  he  defeated  his  antagonist  by  a  large</span></p> <p><span>  majority.  Hon.  A.  Archer  in  Blackall  tras  .</span><span>  the  subject  of  a  concealed  stratagem.  The  :</span><span>  allegiance  of  many  of  his  friends  was  subverted,</span><span>  and  canvassing  against  bim  carried  on  long</span><span>  previous  to  the  dissolution.  Mr.  Archer  went</span><span>  about  among  his  constituents,  addressed  them,</span><span>  and  conversed  with  them  on  subjects  of</span><span>  current  interest.  Mr.  Macdonald  only</span><span>  delivered  cue  speech-at  the  declaration</span><span>  of  tbe  poll.  The  majority  for  Mr.  Archer</span><span>  shows  that  he  still  ^osseasos  the  confidence</span><span>  of  the  great  majority  of  the  electors.  Con-</span><span>  siderable  interest  was  taken  in  the  l'ort</span><span>  Curtis  election,  because  Hon.  G.  Thora  is  a</span><span>  clever  electioneering  tactician,  and  attempts</span><span>  had  been  made  ia  the  local  press  to  under-</span><span>  mine  Hon.  A.  Norton's  political  reputation.</span><span>  Early  in  the  contest  it  beoame  apparent  that</span><span>  the  struggle  would  be  a  keen  one,  and  the</span></p> <p><span>  reBult  confirmed  (fie  anticipation.  Mr.  Norton</span></p> <p><span>  managed  to  hold  his  own  with  a  few  votes</span><span>  to  spare,  and  Mr.  Thorn  is  now  seeking  a  seat</span><span>  from  his  old  constituents  at  Northern  Downs</span><span>  or  Fassifern.  Mr.  Stevensau  had  almost  a</span><span>  walk  over  in  tho  Normanby,  Mr.  I).  S.</span><span>  Wallace's  candidature,  and  that  of  Mr.  W.  S.</span><span>  I'auls,  having  been  a  mistake.  The  lessou</span><span>  taught  those  who  organised  their  expedition,</span><span>  it  is  to  be  hoped,  will  not  be  without  value  to</span></p> <p><span>  them.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  eleotions  in  tho  urban  constituencies</span><span>  show  that  it  is  in  thom  thc  strength  of  tho</span><span>  Opposition  lies.  Mr.  Morehead  made  a</span><span>  gallant  attack  on  the  Valley,  but  it  was</span><span>  attended  with  complete  failure.  Part  of  this</span><span>  is  said  to  have  been  due  to  the  rowdyism  dis-</span><span>  played  at  cue  of  Mr.  Beattie'«  meetings,  and</span><span>  which  it  was  said  was  organised.  But  similar</span><span>  rowdyism  was  manifested  at  one  of  Mr.</span><span>  Kingsford'*  meetings,  but  little  was  said  about</span><span>  it.  The  gain  mode  by  the  Opposition  in</span><span>  South  Brisbane  is  not  great,  as  Mr.</span><span>  Kingsford  was  an  Oppositionist.  lie</span><span>  went  over  to  the  Ministry  on  the  Steel</span><span>  Kaile  Question.  These  elections  are  in-</span><span>  structive,  as  they  show  that  Queen-street</span><span>  is  still  decidedly  opposed  to  the  present</span><span>  Ministry.  At  Bundaberg  and  Maryborough</span></p> <p><span>  the  elections  were  not  carried  to  a  conclusion</span><span>  without  Brisbane  influence  being  exercised  in</span><span>  many  ways.  At  Maryborough  the  German</span><span>  vote  was  secured  to  the  Opposition  by  the</span><span>  efforts  of  an  emissary  from  the  south.  In  the</span><span>  Maryborough  election  local  influences  were  at</span><span>  work,  and  assisted  to  determine  the  result,</span><span>  Mr,  Hurley,  from  what  he  has  seen  in</span><span>  America,  is  inclined  to  try  the  land-grant</span><span>  syBtem  of  railway  construction  under  proper</span><span>  safeguards;  but  Mr.  Sheridsn,  like  Mr.</span><span>  Jordan,  has  a  crow  to  piok  with  the  Ministry,</span><span>  and  so  sides  with  the  Opposition.  Party</span><span>  spirit  entered  to  some  extent  into  the  contest</span><span>  in  Rockhampton,  but  it  was  lost  sight</span><span>  of  in  the  personal  claims  of  the  candidates.</span><span>  This  ia  rendered  sufficiently  plain  by  the</span><span>  position  attained  by  Mr.  Ferguson  at  the  top</span><span>  of  the  poll,  for  he  was  not  by  any  means  a</span><span>  party  candidate.  Should  the  Ministry  put</span><span>  land-grants  and  Coolies  in  the  Governor's</span><span>  Speech,  then  he  will  become  an  independent</span><span>  member,  or  perhaps  he  will  join  the  coming</span><span>  coalition.  Mr.  Paterson  as  an  Opposition</span><span>  candidate  was  as  pronounced  as  Mr.  Higson,</span><span>  and  the  personal  claims  or  influence  of  the</span><span>  latter  must  have  secured  his  election.  Mr.</span><span>  Paterson  claims  that  Liberalism  prevails</span><span>  among  the  workiug  men  of  Rockhampton,</span><span>  but  while  a  liberal  spirit  does  pervade  their</span><span>  minds,  it  is  not  of  the  Queen-street  typo  he</span><span>  represents.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  electors  of  Rockhampton  of  all  parties  ¡</span><span>  are  pleased  to  hear  their  rejected  candidates</span><span>  are  about  to  try  for  other  seats  in  Parliament.</span><span>  Both  are  good  men.  There  is  something</span><span>  chivalric  in  Mr.  Paterson's  attack  upon  the</span><span>  squatting  stronghold  in  the  west.  As  au</span><span>  Opposition  candidate  he  has  many  claims  to</span><span>  support,  but  whether  he  would  make  an</span><span>  eligible  representative  of  the  Mitchell  is  a</span><span>  question  the  electors  must  consider  and  de-</span><span>  termine.  Mr.  Rees  Jones'  prospects  of  elec-</span><span>  tion  for  Clermont  will  depend  on  the  action  of</span><span>  Mr.  D.  S.  Wallace.  That  gentleman  has  gone</span><span>  south,  and  should  ho  determine,  aa  is  most</span><span>  i  probable,  not  to  go  to  the  poll,  then  Mr.  Jones</span></p> <p><span>  will  have  a  fair  chance  of  being  returned.</span><span>  '  Though  not  in  the  strict  sense  of  the  word  a</span></p> <p><span>  local  man,  Mr.  Jones  will  make  au  admirable</span><span>  representative  for  that  electorate.  His  long</span><span>  residence  in  the  district,  intimate  knowledge</span><span>  of  colonial  affairs,  business  habits,  legal  know-</span><span>  ledge,  and  high  position  in  this  community,</span><span>  should  commend  him  to  any  constituency  in</span><span>  the  Central  district,  and  above  all  to  that  of</span><span>  Clermont  and  Copperfield.</span></p> <p><span>  MR.  P.  F.  MACDONALD  ÍB  evidently  very</span><span>  sore  about  his  rejection  in  the  contest  with</span><span>  Mr.  Archer  for  Blackall,  and  gave  vent  to  his</span><span>  feelings  in  some  peevish  remarks  at  the</span><span>  declaration  of  the  poll  at  Stanwell  on  Tuesday</span><span>  afternoon  last.  Ho  indulged  in  a  few  of  those</span><span>  vague  and  despicable  statements  which  arc  too</span><span>  characteristic  of  hts  remarks,  If  Mr.  Mac-</span><span>  donald  wishes  to  impress  the  electors  witli  a</span><span>  sense  of  tho  proprioty  of  what  he  says,  he</span><span>  should  follow  up  such  accusations  as  he  ie</span><span>  accustomed  to  make  with  proof.  He</span><span>  blamed  Mr,  Archer  for  regarding  Blackall</span><span>  as  a  pocket  borough,  aud  never  studying  the</span><span>  interests  of  the  electors  while  he  was  in</span><span>  Parliament,  and  with  having  taken  his  views</span><span>  on  politics  from  a  few  parlous  who  live  upon</span><span>  the  Range,  and  constituted  themselves  the</span><span>  mouthpieces  of  the  electora  of  Blackall.  There</span><span>  is  not  thc  slightest  proof  that  Mr.  Archer  has</span><span>  treated  Blackall  as  if  it  were  a  pocket</span><span>  borough.  He  has  resided  here  the  greater</span><span>  part  of  bis  time,  he  has  gone  out  and  in</span><span>  among  thc  electors,  he  has  inado  himself  inti-</span><span>  mate  with  their  wishes,  and  has  ever  doue  all</span><span>  that  he  considered  best  for  their  moral,  intel-</span><span>  lectual,  and  material  prosperity.  He  has</span><span>  uevcr  failed  upon  auy  occasion  that  wc  are</span><span>  aware  of  to  discharge  the  duties  incumbent</span><span>  upon  him  as  their  representative.  As  to  thc</span><span>  statement  that  he  takes  his  politics  from  a</span><span>  few  persons  on  the  Bango,  that  implies  a  want</span><span>  of  independence  and  intelligence  on  thc  part</span><span>  of  Mr.  Archer,  and  conveys  an  insinuation</span><span>  anyone  with  a  sense  of  gentlemanliness  would</span><span>  be  loth  to  made  against  another,  unless  he</span><span>  were  prepared  to  substantiate  it.  AU  the  elec-</span><span>  tors  of  Blackall  who  live  upon  the  Range  do</span><span>  not  exceed  a  dozen,  and  we  do  not  think  they</span><span>  possess  such  an  influence  over  Mr.  Archer  os</span></p> <p><span>  would  lead  him  to  change  his  belief  from  what  J</span><span>  he  considered  to  be  right  to  that  which  j</span><span>  was  wrong.  Mr.  Macdonald  spoke  also</span><span>  about  Mr.  Archer  haviug  out  paid  canvassers,</span><span>  and  herc  again  ho  was  unable  to  provo  his</span><span>  assertion.  His  reference  to  the  Divisional</span></p> <p><span>  Board  dispute  indicated  clearly  the  use  he  has  j</span></p> <p><span>  been  making  of  that  affair  to  alienate  Mr.</span><span>  Archer's  old  friends.  It  is  pitiful  to  have  to</span><span>  allude  to  such  things  in  connection  with  an</span><span>  election  that  on  one  side  was  conducted  with</span><span>  the  utmost  fairness  and  propriety.  If  Mr.</span><span>  Macdonald  would  only  believe  better  things</span><span>  of  his  adversaries,  and  make  fewer  rash  aud</span><span>  inconsiderate  statements,  he  would  gain  more</span><span>  credit  and  reputation  among  the  electors.</span></p> <p><span>  AK  amusing  story  is  told  of  a  Scotch</span><span>  worthy  who  got  on  thc  sproc  occasionally,  and</span><span>  on  returuiug  from  one  of  his  bouts,  bia  roaster</span><span>  asked  him  what  had  been  the  cause  of  his</span></p> <p><span>  last  escapade.  ""Oh,  man,""  he  replied,  ""did</span><span>  you  no  hearthat  my  grand  whistling  canary  was</span><span>  dead.""  ""  Surely,""  said  his  employer,  ""that</span><span>  is  no  great  excuse  for  getting  druuk,  and</span><span>  loBing  several  days'  work.'*  ""  Perhaps  not,""</span><span>  was  the  respouse,  ""  but  any  excuse  is  good</span><span>  enough  when  one  has  an  iuclination  that  way.""</span><span>  Mr.  .lohn  0'Shanesy  seems  to  have  been  much</span><span>  in  thc  position  of  this  drouthy  individn.il,</span><span>  with  respect  trt  the  election  fur  Blackall.  He</span><span>  excused  himself  for  having  to  oppose  Mr.</span><span>  Archer,  beeitisc  of  that  gentleman's  lecture  on</span><span>  thc  dry-belt  theory,  which  was  delivered  on</span><span>  the  5th  Maruh,  1870.  It  seems  strange  bow</span><span>  Mr.  O'Shanesy  e.ouUl  have  goue  about  for  thc</span><span>  lait  ten  years  with  this  dry  belt  theory  work</span><span>  in""  in  his  inward*,  and  never  summoned  up</span><span>  conrane  to  speak  to  Mr.  Archer  upon  the  sub-</span><span>  ject,  lt  would  hilve  been  much  better  had</span><span>  he  *iime  so,  than  to  have  rtregeuted  himself  in</span><span>  thc  way  he  did,  making  that  au  excuse  for  his</span><span>  action,  when  the  interests  involved  were</span><span>  purely  of  a  political  character.

On  1Ion)lay  .etoo</span><span>  ing  last  a  disturbance  was  heard  going  on  411</span><span>  a  house  ia  Archer-street,  sad  a  neighbour,</span><span>  being  apprehensive  that  wrong  was  being</span><span>  done,  weut  to  a  policeman,  and  gave  him  in-</span><span>  formation,  but  he  treated  the  matter  lightly.</span><span>  Next  evening,  however,  information  was</span><span>  lodged  with  the  police  that  a  woman  in  the</span><span>  bouse  in  question  had  died  suddenly.  The</span><span>  body,  upoo  examination,  was  found  to  be</span><span>  covered  with  innumerable  bruises,  and  she</span><span>  had  evidently  been  the  subject  of  much</span></p> <p><span>  violence.  A  man  named  Gardner  has  been  j</span></p> <p><span>  arrested  in  connection  with  the  caso.  1</span></p> <p><span>  ANOTHER  lot  of  immigrants  were  landed</span><span>  hero  from  thc  Dritish-India  steamer  Duke  of</span><span>  Buckingham  this  week,  and  are  meeting  with</span><span>  rcadyemploymentatfairratesof  wages.

"<p><span>  KOCtvllAMI'TON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY.  AUGUST  29.  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  latest  advices  from  home  leave  no</span><span>  room  for  doubt,  that  the  relations</span><span>  between  France  and  Great  Britain  are,</span><span>  at  the  present,  more  strained  than  they</span><span>  have  been  since  the  days  of  the  old</span><span>  Egypto-Syrian  dispute  in  Mehemet  Ali's</span><span>  time.  The  friendship  with  the  French</span><span>  Republic,  which  the  Gladstone  Govern-</span><span>  ment  has  taken  such  pains  to  encourage,</span><span>  has  of  recent  years  been  subjected  to</span><span>  strains  of  more  or  less  severe  character.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  impossible  to  close  our  eyes  to  the</span><span>  fact  that  among  the  various  expeditions,</span><span>  in  which  the  French  are  now  engaged,</span><span>  the  one  that  excites  most  enthusiasm  in</span><span>  France  is  that  which  is  supposed  to  be</span><span>  likely  to  be  most  injurious  to  England,</span><span>  and  English  interests.  There  can  be</span><span>  no  doubt,  also,  that  the  French  are  by</span><span>  no  means  pleased  at  the  predominance</span><span>  of  English  influence  in  Egypt,  which</span><span>  has  been  the  result  of  the  repression  of</span><span>  the  rebellion  in  that  country  by  force  of</span><span>  English  arms.  And  they  are  equally</span><span>  jealous  of  thc  attitude  that  has  been</span><span>  taken  by  Great  Britain,  in  connection</span><span>  with  the  construction  of  a  second  Suez</span><span>  Canal.  Such  being  the  case,  it  seems</span><span>  that,  being  unable  with  safely  to  find</span><span>  scope  for  her  irrepressible  energy  in</span><span>  Europe,  thc  feels  called  to  exert  her-</span><span>  self  in  sending  expeditions  to  thc  remoter</span><span>  portions  of  thc  jilobe.  Thc  enterprises</span><span>  to  Tommin,  Tunis,  Madagascar,  and  on</span></p> <p><span>  the  Coniro  are  not  unnaturally  regarded</span><span>  as  évidences  of  a  desire  on  her  part</span><span>  to  form  lire  linsis  of  a  Colonial  Empire,</span><span>  and  to  revert  lo  her  Cnlonnl  policy  of</span><span>  overa  cer.lrry  ;II;H.

There  is  no  need,</span><span>  whatever  may  be  ilie  desire  for  ""  fresh</span><span>  fields  and  pastures  new,""  for  increased</span></p> <p><span>  territory  to  sustain  a  large  and  teeming</span><span>  population,  for  in  France  there  is  room</span><span>  for  all  her  sons  and  daughters  at  home.</span><span>  Her  population  increases  very  slightly,</span><span>  and  in  the  rural  districts,  from  which  a</span><span>  class  suitable  for  emigrants  could  be</span><span>  found,  it  actually  decreases.  The  estab-</span><span>  lishment  of  French  colonies  must,  there-</span><span>  fore,  of  necessity  be  a  purely  artificial  one,</span><span>  and  can  be  by  no  means  an  easy</span><span>  process.  With  England  the  case  is</span><span>  exactly  the  reverse.  For  several  cen-</span><span>  turies,  her  population  has  overflowed</span><span>  her  borders,  and  still  the  cry  is  raised</span><span>  for  increased  emigration.  Outlets  for</span><span>  this  overflow  of  population  become  im-</span><span>  peratively  necessary,  and  then  it  is  that</span><span>  English  colonies  have  accordingly  been</span><span>  founded,  and  are  now  flourishing  in</span><span>  every  quarter  of  the  globe.  That  France</span><span>  can  ever  rival  England  as  a  colonising</span><span>  nation  is  obviously  impossible,  and  in</span><span>  resorting  to  the  experiments,  which  were</span><span>  carried  on  with  such  doubtful  success</span><span>  by  Louis  XIV.,  and  other  French</span><span>  monarchs,  she  is  merely  finding  a  tem-</span><span>  porary  vent  for  the  aggressive  sentiment,</span><span>  and  the  desire  for  la  gloire,  which  still</span><span>  afflicts  her,  but  which,  at  the  present,</span><span>  she  cannot  safely  exercise  in  quarttfs</span></p> <p><span>  nearer  home.</span></p> <p><span>  In  Tonquin,  the  French  appear  to</span><span>  have  entered  upon  an  undertaking  of</span><span>  more  magnitude  and  difficulty  than  they</span><span>  were  probably  aware  of  when  they  started.</span><span>  It  seems  hardly  probable  that  China</span><span>  will  quietly  permit  the  French  conquest</span><span>  of  Anani,  and  though  it  is  obvious  that</span><span>  France  is  a  more  powerful  military  State</span><span>  than  China,  still  the  latter  may  prove  no</span><span>  mean  antagonist  against  the  force  of  a</span><span>  European  power,  which  would  be  far</span></p> <p><span>  distant  from  its  base  and  from</span><span>  reinforcements.

There  is  every  proba-</span><span>  bility  that  Maryborough,  holding  up  to</span><span>  view  ber  own  affairs,  and  regarding  them</span><span>  from  a  near  stand-point,  will  shut  out  the</span><span>  prospect  of  those  of  Rockhampton.  A</span><span>  development  of  selfishness  will  be  the</span><span>  natural  consequence  among  the  Mary</span><span>  boroughians,  and  the  creation  of  enmity</span><span>  and  antagonism  among  citizens  of</span><span>  other  communities.  We  are  all</span><span>  members  of  one  body  politic,  and</span></p> <p><span>  should  seek  to  promote  our  own</span><span>  interests  and  those  of  the  commu-</span></p> <p><span>  nity  generally,  without  prejudice  to  either.</span><span>  When  progress  is  brought  about  in  a</span><span>  legitimate  fashion  we  should  all  rejoice</span><span>  at  it,  for  healthy  activity  in  one  part  of</span><span>  our  corporate  system  will  not  fail  to  act</span><span>  beneficially  on  every  other.  It  is  with</span><span>  great  pleasure,  therefore,  we  have</span><span>  perused  a  copy  of  the  last  issued  Annual</span><span>  Report  and  Proceedings  of  the  Mary-</span><span>  borough  Chamber  of  Commerce.  The</span><span>  borough  on  the  Mary  River,  is  an  im-</span><span>  portant  factor  in  our  colonial  progress</span><span>  and  well-being,  and  this  Report,  our</span><span>  readers  will  be  pleased  to  learn,  shows</span><span>  that  its  commercial  affairs  are  being</span><span>  managed  by  gentlemen  of  public  spirit,</span><span>  enterprise,  and  business  acumen  and</span><span>  experience.  Of  all  this  the  Report</span><span>  affords  good  evidence.  At  the  annual</span></p> <p><span>  meeting,  the  Chairman,  Mr.  A.  H.</span><span>  Wilson,  while  congratulating  the  Cham-</span><span>  ber  on  the  amount  of  work  done  in  the</span><span>  course  of  the  year,  stated  that  the  trade</span><span>  of  the  town  and  district  had  improved,</span><span>  and  was  in  a  sound  way.  Now,  it  must</span><span>  give  confidence  to  investors-and</span><span>  the  eyes  of  capitalists  in  the  southern</span><span>  colonies  and  the  old  country,</span><span>  scrutinise  keenly  the  state  of  affairs</span><span>  in  all  parts  of  Queensland-to  be</span><span>  told  this  by  a  gentleman  resident  in  the</span><span>  locality,  who  holds  a  position  of  high</span><span>  respectability,  and  who,  from  his  busi-</span><span>  ness  relations,  has  an  intimate  and</span><span>  accurate  knowledge  of  the  course  of</span><span>  trade  and  commerce  in  that  district.</span><span>  From  the  Report  itself  we  find  that  in</span><span>  the  course  of  the  year  the  Committee  con-</span><span>  sidered  and  dealt  with  upwards  of  twenty</span><span>  matters  of  more  or  less  public  impor-</span><span>  tance.  The  town  has  been  growing,  and</span><span>  no  sooner  did  the  necessity  for  it  appear</span></p> <p><span>  than  the  Chamber  secured  an  extension</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  postal  delivery.  We  noticed  at</span><span>  the  time  they  were  made  the  efforts  put</span><span>  forth  by  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  to</span><span>  bring  Maryborough  prominently  before</span><span>  people  in  the  United  Kingdom,  by</span><span>  issuing  a  pamphlet  on  the  indus-</span><span>  tries  and  resources  of  the  district,  and</span><span>  large  photographic  views  of  the  town</span><span>  and  scenery  in  its  vicinity,  Specimens</span><span>  of  the  latter  which  have  come  under  our</span><span>  observation  are  magnificent  works  of  art,</span><span>  and  could  not  fail  to  produce  an  excellent</span><span>  impression  of  the  district  wherever  they</span><span>  were  exhibited.  It  is  something  worth</span></p> <p><span>  thc  while  of  our  Chamber  of  Commerce</span><span>  lo  know  that  these  paid  their  own  ex-</span><span>  penses.  The  money  realised  by  the  sale</span><span>  of  photographs  was  ^146,  and  when  all</span></p> <p><span>  the  items  of  expenditure  were  summed</span><span>  up  the  deficiency  in  the  account</span><span>  amounted  to  only  ¿¿""5  17s.  We  have</span><span>  not  the  least  hesitation  in  concurring</span><span>  with  the  remark  made  in  the  Report</span><span>  that  this  small  sum  would  be  more  than</span><span>  compensated  for  by  the  benefits  accruing</span><span>  to  the  district  from  the  issuing  of  these</span><span>  photographs.  Among  other  malters</span><span>  which  received  the  attention  of  the</span><span>  Committee  of  the  Chamber  was  the</span><span>  establishment  of  the  telephone  system</span><span>  of  commercial  communication.  The</span><span>  Exchange  was  opened  almost  a  year</span><span>  ago  with  thirty-two  members,  yet  in  less</span><span>  than  eight  months  the  number  had  risen</span><span>  to  fifty,  and  we  have  no  doubt  it  has</span><span>  since  been  increased.  Here  again,  we</span><span>  have  an  evidence  of  business  activity,</span><span>  and  material  wealth,  that  cannot  fail  to</span><span>  strike  people  at  a  distance,  for  in  few</span><span>  places  of  the  same  population  in  the  old</span><span>  country  has  the  telephone  system  been</span><span>  established.  The  Report  shows  that</span><span>  the  Committee  have  been  keeping  a</span><span>  sharp  lookout  on  the  progress  of</span><span>  the  river  navigation  improvements,</span><span>  and  that  if  these  are  not  so  great</span></p> <p><span>  as  could  be  wished  it  is  no</span><span>  fault  of  the  Chamber  of  Commerce.</span><span>  An  important  subject  of  general  interest</span><span>  discussed  by  the  Chamber,  is  the  regis-</span><span>  tration  of  land.  At  present  registration</span><span>  business  must  be  done  by  the  transmis-</span><span>  sion  of  papers,  &c,  to  Brisbane.  It  is</span><span>  contended  ilia*,  great  advantages  would</span><span>  accrue  to  thc  public  and  various  com</span><span>  porate  bodies,  by  establishing,  in  the</span><span>  principle  towns  in  the  colony,  convenient</span><span>  offices  for  the  registration  of  land.</span><span>  Among  the  most  obvious  of  the  advan-</span><span>  tages  would  be  the  prevention  of  delays</span><span>  which  now  take  place.  These  in  all</span><span>  localities,  not  in  immediate  communica-</span><span>  tion  with  Brisbane,  are  often  exceedingly</span><span>  irritating  and  annoying.  The  Mary-</span><span>  borough  Chamber  have  resolved  to  peti-</span><span>  tion  Parliament  on  the  subject  ;  and</span><span>  our  Chamber  ought  to  follow  their</span><span>  example.  The  coastal  mail  service  and</span><span>  its  connection  with  Maryborough,  the</span><span>  speed  of  trains  on  the  local  railways,  the</span><span>  extension  of  the  railway  to  the  wharf,</span><span>  immigration,  the  inland  mail  service,  the</span><span>  railway  policy  of  the  district-these  and</span></p> <p><span>  other  minor  matters  have  also  been  dealt</span><span>  with  in  a  practical  business  like  fashion.</span><span>  If  the  minutes  of  our  own  Chamber  of</span><span>  Commerce  were  gone  through  we  are</span><span>  confident  an  equally  interesting  Report</span><span>  could  be  compiled  ;  and,  when  wc  look</span><span>  at  thc  licit  little  pamphlet  issued  by</span><span>  the  Maryborough  Chamber,  containing,</span><span>  besides  the  document  referred  to,</span></p> <p><span>  a  great  many  statistics  regarding  the</span><span>  imports,  exports,  products,  ¿.'C.,  of</span><span>  thc  town  and  district,  we  ro^n't</span><span>  that  llvs  his  not  been  done.

"<p><span>  KOCKM.WirrON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  OCTOBER  31,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  I  SOMB  discussion  has  taken  place  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  columns  of  our  southern  contemporaries</span><span>  on  what  we  may  call  practical  expressions</span><span>  I  of  nationalism,  on  the  part  of  persons</span></p> <p><span>  resident  in  this  colony.  It  has  been</span><span>  excited  hy  the  assertion  that,  in  the</span><span>  general  election  just  about  over,  the</span><span>  Germans  gave  a  solid  vo'.e  fur  thc</span><span>  Liberal  Party.  We  will  not  co  so  far  as</span><span>  a  contemporary  has  done,  and  rcniaik</span><span>  ""  It  is  hardly  an  exaggeration  to  say</span><span>  that  the  Parliament  now  chosen  is  more</span><span>  representative  of  the  German  than  the</span><span>  British  section  of  the  community,  owing</span><span>  to  the  fact  that  the  Germans  hold  the</span><span>  balance  of  power.""  That  such  a  remark</span><span>  should  seem  warranted  is  in  itself  a  mis-</span><span>  fortune.  Without  admitting  that  the  Ger-</span><span>  mans  itt  our  community  hold  thc  balance</span><span>  of  power  lhere  ran  be  no  denying  lite</span><span>  fart,  that  they  possess  a  ronsitlerahlc</span><span>  amount  ol  nolilir.il  influence,  and  that</span></p> <p><span>  they  made  it  felt  in  the  last  election.</span><span>  Mr.  Isamhert's  scat  fur  Rosewood  was</span><span>  felt  to  lie  unassailable,  and  the  political</span><span>  emisaties  who  visited  several  consti-</span><span>  tuencies,  notably  Maryborough  and</span><span>  Wide  Hay,  fulfilled  their  mission  care-</span><span>  fully  and  effectively.  It  is  argued  hy</span><span>  certain  journals  that  the  Germans  have</span><span>  supported  thc  Liberal  patty,  because</span><span>  they  had  received  no  favours  fur  whir  li</span><span>  lo  thank  the  parly  in  power,  lliuy  Ind</span><span>  no  sympathy  willi  the  schemes  of  the  pre-</span><span>  sent  Government,  and  they  desired  to</span><span>  see  a  change  of  government.  All  these</span><span>  arc  fair  grounds  of  political  action.</span><span>  If  colonists  do  not  approve  of  the</span><span>  politics  of  any  parlv,  it  is  clearly  their</span><span>  privilege  and  their  lunciion  to  ilismis';</span><span>  th  .-rn  from  powr.  ll'it  lint  do  s  nut</span><span>  explain  away  the  ciiciiat^tinces  that</span></p> <p><span>  ^  appeals  were  made  to  the  Germans  in  !</span></p> <p><span>  their  own  language,  and  that  they  gave  a</span><span>  solid,  and,  therefore,  to  some  extent,</span><span>  unintelligent  vote.  There  was  a  mani-</span></p> <p><span>  festation  of  nationalism  above  and</span></p> <p><span>  beyond  party  consideration.</span></p> <p><span>  Exception  has  been  taken  to  a  display</span><span>  of  nationalism  in  another  quarter.  Il</span><span>  has  been  determined  to  bold  a  meeting</span><span>  of  Irishmen  in  Melbourne,  for  the  pur-</span><span>  pose  of  discussing  Irish  affairs,  and</span><span>  bringing  influence  lo  bear  on  the</span><span>  English  Government  in  connection  with</span><span>  them.  Dr.  O'Docherty,  and  Mr.  Mac-</span><span>  rossan  are  to  represent  Queensland  in</span><span>  this  proposed  convention.  Of  course,</span><span>  these  gentlemen  will  find  reasons  for</span><span>  their  conduct  which  will  seem  to  them</span><span>  sound  and  good,  and  warranted  by  ex-</span><span>  perience  and  observation,  and  the</span><span>  principles  of  good  Government  Hut</span><span>  these  reasons  may  not  be  so  regarded</span><span>  by  their  fellow  colonists  of  other</span><span>  nationalities.  Indeed,  they  may  seem</span><span>  far  fetched,  inequitable,  and  unjust  to</span><span>  Englishmen  and  Scotchmen.  Apart</span><span>  altogether  from  the  reasonableness  of</span><span>  the  demands  of  the  Irish  for  Home</span></p> <p><span>  Rule,  comes  thc  question  of  the  propriety</span><span>  of  forcing  it  on  public  attention  at</span><span>  present.  Ireland  has  been  thrown  into</span><span>  a  state  of  unrest  and  agitation  ;  blood</span><span>  has  been  shed  ;  and  the  material</span><span>  prosperity  of  the  country  sadly</span><span>  interrupted  by  the  machinations  of</span><span>  those,  who  have  set  themselves</span><span>  up  to  dictate  on  her  behalf  to</span><span>  the  British  Government.  All  colonists</span></p> <p><span>  may  intend  is  to  give  moral  support  to</span><span>  their  countrymen  in  the  home  of  their</span><span>  nativity  ;  but  the  fact  cannot  be  got  rid</span><span>  of  that  such  moral  support  has  recently</span><span>  been  utilised  towards  the  accomplishment</span><span>  of  diabolical  purposes.  Oulside  of  this,</span><span>  again,  is  the  question  as  to  the  capability</span><span>  of  colonists  to  discuss  old  county  aff.iirs,</span><span>  and  in  doing  so  to  appreciate  at  their</span><span>  true  value  circumstances  that  exist  at  the</span><span>  oilier  side  of  the  world.</span></p> <p><span>  From  these  remarks  we  think  it  must  j</span><span>  be  apparent  that  the  display  of  nationa-</span><span>  lism  is  not  a  thing  that  ought  to  be</span><span>  regarded  with  favour  in  this  colony,</span></p> <p><span>  or  indeed  in  Australia.  Men  of</span><span>  all  countries  and  creeds  are  here</span></p> <p><span>  engaged  in  forming  a  new  nation.  We</span><span>  have  new  interests  lo  study,  novel</span><span>  physical  circumstances  lo  deal  with,  and</span><span>  political  institutions  to  found,  and  laws</span><span>  lo  enact,  which  shall  be  productive  of</span><span>  our  happiness,  and  ihose  who  are  to</span><span>  come  after  us.  in  this  grand  and</span><span>  majestic  work  it  is  the  duty  of  every</span><span>  intelligent  citizen  to  take  part.  Patriotism</span><span>  demands  it  of  him  ;  public  spirit  calls</span><span>  upon  him  to  sacrifice  a  portion  of  his</span><span>  means  and  his  lime  in  it.  Our  duty  to</span><span>  the  colony  commands,  and  should  re-</span><span>  ceive  precedence  of  all  others.  Though</span><span>  not  so  homogeneous  as  the  nations  of</span><span>  Europe,  Australia  occupies  the  position</span><span>  and  possesses  the  interests  of  a  nation.</span><span>  Our  prosperity,  if  not  our  liberties  and</span><span>  independence,  point  out  to  us  that  we</span><span>  should  consolidate  our  national  feelings</span><span>  and  aspirations.  We  should  strive  to</span><span>  define  and  assert  our  individuality.</span><span>  That  being  so,  it  is  clear  thc  manifesta-</span><span>  tions  o!  nationalism,  to  which  we  have</span><span>  referred,  are  objectionable.  They  must</span><span>  interfere  with  the  great  work  we  have  on</span><span>  hand,  and  in  which  every  elector  is  per-</span><span>  sonally  interested.  Whatever  is  calcu-</span><span>  lated  lo  mar  thc  harmony  ol  that  work,</span><span>  in  its  progress  or  completeness,  merits</span><span>  .reprobation.  No  one  will  deny  that</span><span>  manifestations  of  foreign  nationalism  in</span><span>  a  public  and  political  manner  will  cer-</span><span>  tainly  have  this  effect,  and  are,  therefore,</span><span>  to  be  deprecated.  They  show  an  im-</span><span>  perfect  comprehension  of  the  magnitude</span><span>  of  the  work  that  lies  before  every</span><span>  citizen  of  this  colony  who  think  we</span><span>  should  devote  time  and  thoughllul</span></p> <p><span>  attention  to  the  affairs  of  distant  coun-</span><span>  tries,  in  Queensland  we  are  the  first</span><span>  generation  of  what  we  hope  will  be  a</span><span>  great  and  powerful  nation  ;  and  we</span><span>  should  let  nothing  come  between  us  and</span><span>  our  endeavour  to  make  this  country</span><span>  glorious  and  free-the  home  of  a  wise,</span><span>  prosperous,  and  happy  people.</span></p> ",Article,1883-10-31,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY.  JANUARY  31,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  FROM  late  files  of  the  home  papers,  we</span><span>  observe  that  the  agitation  among  farmers</span><span>  in  the  United  Kingdom,  for  the  removal</span><span>  of  the  hindrances  to  agriculture,  still</span><span>  continues.  Judging  from  the  earnest-</span><span>  ness  and  persistency  with  which  the</span><span>  efforts  for  the  alleviation  of  grievances</span><span>  are  continued,  a  large  number  of  gentle-</span><span>  men-practical  agriculturists-still  have</span><span>  great  faith  in  the  capabilities  of  the</span><span>  industry.  They  believe  thal,  under</span><span>  proper  arrangements,  the  old  country  is</span><span>  capable  of  containing  a  large  indepen-</span><span>  dent  population.  Landlords,  however,</span><span>  display  far  more  willingness  than  they</span><span>  were  wont  to  listen  to  representations</span><span>  upon  landholding  in  tenancy.  Farmers</span><span>  and  proprietors  have  discovered  that  in</span><span>  emigration  there  is  a  relief  from  the</span><span>  situation,  when  it  is  prejudicial  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  interests  of  the  former.  Factors  cannot</span></p> <p><span>  now  rudely  domineer  over  tenants,</span><span>  because  they  have  discovered  the  latter</span><span>  arc  not  afraid  to  leave  their  tenancies,</span><span>  and  set  out  for  Canada  and  the  United</span><span>  States,  in  search  of  freehold  farms.</span><span>  There  can  be  no  doubt  thc  landlords</span><span>  have  given  way  to  a  large  extent  ;  that</span><span>  the  tenants  now  enter  upon  farms  on</span><span>  more  equitable  terms,  so  far  as  they  are</span><span>  concerned  :  and  that  the  competion  for</span><span>  land  is  not  so  keen  as  it  was  five  years</span><span>  ago.  Still  the  farmers  societies</span><span>  are  not  relaxing  in  their  efforts</span><span>  to  make  thc  position  of  tenants</span><span>  as  easy  and  comfoi  table  as  possible.  In</span><span>  the  Agricultural  Gazette  of  November</span><span>  i  gib,  wc  have  the  report  of  a  meeting  of</span><span>  the  Central  Farmers'  Club,  at  which  the</span><span>  Secretary,  Mr,  Dmce,  read  a  most  in</span></p> <p><span>  teresting  paper  on  Farm  Tenancies.  The</span><span>  English  farmers  have  not  that  antipathy</span><span>  to  landlords,  which  their  congeners^  in</span><span>  Ireland  display,  and  discuss  the  question</span><span>  of  tenancies  without  once  raising  that  of</span><span>  abolition.  It  is  the  conditions  and  mode</span><span>  of  farm  tenute,  which  are  regarded  as</span><span>  forming  the  foundation  stone,  not  only  of</span><span>  the  farmers'  individual  prosperity,'  but</span><span>  of  his  usefulness  to  the  whole  nation.</span></p> <p><span>  I  Landlordism  is  not  the  hateful  thing</span></p> <p><span>  depicted  recently  by  a  writer  in  the</span><span>  Victorian  Review,  and  English  tenants</span><span>  are  quite  content  to  hold  land  on  lease,</span><span>  provided  the  terms  are  mutually  agree-</span></p> <p><span>  able.</span></p> <p><span>  Among  the  principal  points  noticed</span><span>  by  Mr.  Druce,  as  forming  '  the  subject  of</span><span>  differences  between  landlords  and  tenants,</span><span>  is  the  length  of  contracts.  Should  farms</span><span>  be  held  under  lease  for  a  fixed  number</span></p> <p><span>  of  years,  or  by  yearly  agreements  ?  This</span><span>  question  he  answered  by  advocating</span><span>  yearly  tenancies.  At  the  same  time  he</span><span>  mentioned  a  case  in  which,  under  the</span><span>  long  leasing  system,  a  farm  had  been</span><span>  held  by  one  generation  after  another  of</span><span>  the  same  family  for  nearly  two  hundred</span><span>  years.  He  gave  it  as  his  opinion,</span><span>  however,  that  the  form  of  holding</span><span>  most  popular  among  farmers  is</span><span>  a  yearly  tenancy,  with  twelve  months</span><span>  notice  to  quit..  The  advantages  of</span><span>  this  system  are  that,  as  landlords  and</span><span>  tenants  dislike  changes,  they  can  go  on</span><span>  easily  under  yearly  tenancies.  If  hard</span><span>  times  come,  and  the  tenant  is  oppressed</span><span>  by  a  succession  of  bad  seasons,  he  can</span><span>  enter  ,into  a  new  agreement  with  his</span><span>  landlord,  or  get  rid  of  his  farm  without</span><span>  much  trouble.  In  the  case  of  a  farmer's</span><span>  death,  moreover,  the  tenancy  can  be  at</span><span>  once  brought  to  a  close,  and  the  farmer's</span><span>  affairs  more  promptly  settled  than  under</span><span>  the  leasing  system,  Modifications  of</span><span>  the  latter  system  have  been  introduced</span><span>  on  some  estates,  which,  Mr.  Druce</span><span>  says,  have  operated  well.  On  Lord</span><span>  Tollemache's  property,  for  instance,  the</span><span>  farms  are  let  on  a  twenty-one</span><span>  years'  lease;  but  may  be  terminated  at</span><span>  any  time  by  the  tenant  giving  a  year's</span><span>  notice.  This  shows  how  far  landlords</span><span>  are  now  prepared  to  go,  in  order  to</span><span>  propitiate  tenants  ;  and  under  what</span><span>  favourable  conditions  farming  may  now</span><span>  be  carried  on  in  England.</span></p> <p><span>  Among  the  Statutes  relating  to  agri-</span><span>  culture  the  law  of  distress  has  become</span><span>  exceedingly  obnoxious.  It  gives  the</span><span>  landlord  power,  when  the  tenant  is  in</span><span>  arrears,  to  seize  the  crop,  stock,  and</span><span>  implements  on  a  farm,  and  sell  them  for</span><span>  the  rent,  regardless  of  the  claims  of</span><span>  other  creditors.  This  law  has  been</span><span>  loudly  complained  of  by  merchants  and</span><span>  machinists,  because  it  has  happened  that</span><span>  a  larmer,  in  apparently  good  circum-</span><span>  stances,  has  obtained  manures,  feeding</span><span>  stuffs,  household  necessaries,  and</span><span>  implements  on  credit.  Afterwards  when</span><span>  the  sellérs  sought  payment  they  have</span><span>  found  the  whole  of  their  goods  had  been</span><span>  escheated  to  the  landlord  for  rent.  The</span><span>  result  has  been  that  farmers  can  only  get</span><span>  credit  to  a  limited  extent.  Besides,</span><span>  under:  the  obnoxious  statute  referred  to,</span><span>  agisted  stock,  and  hired  implements  on</span><span>  the  farm  could  be  seized  and  sold  for</span><span>  the  landlord's  behoof.  There  is  every</span><span>  probability  that,  owing  to  the  manner</span><span>  in  which  this  matter  has  been  pressed  on</span><span>  the  attention  of  Parliament,  the  land-</span><span>  lord's  right  of  distraining  will  be  limited</span><span>  to  one  year's  rent,  and  that  agisted  stock,</span><span>  and  borrowed  implements  will  not  be</span><span>  liable  to  seizure.  In  these  circumstances</span><span>  there  will  be  a  chance  for  other  creditors</span></p> <p><span>  to  get  something  out  of  a  bankrupt</span></p> <p><span>  farmer's  estate.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  topic  to  which  Mr.  Druce</span><span>  called  attention  was  ""  Restrictive  Cove-</span><span>  nants.""  By  this  be  meant  agreements</span><span>  binding  farmers  down  to  certain  systems</span><span>  of  cropping.  On  some  estates  farmers</span><span>  had  almost  no  freedom  in  cultivating  the</span><span>  land.  They  were  bound  down  to  a  rota-</span><span>  tion  of  crops,  and  had  to  cultivate,  in  a</span><span>  sense,  by  the  book.  In  writing  upon</span><span>  this  subject  we  have  pointed  out  that</span><span>  there  was  a  time  in  the  history  of  agri-</span><span>  culture  in  England,  when  the  tenants</span><span>  were  so  ignorant  and  thriftless,  it  was</span><span>  good  for  them  to  have  their  work  cut</span><span>  out  for  them.  A  change  bas  taken</span><span>  place  within  the  present  century.</span><span>  The  tenants  are  among  the  most  intel-</span><span>  ligent  classes  in  the  community,  and</span><span>  know  more  about  farming  than  the  land-</span><span>  lords.  With  regard  to  the  system  ol</span><span>  husbandry  to  be  pursued  in  cultivating</span><span>  the  land,  owners  have  had  to  give  way,</span><span>  and  though  tenants  cannot  do  just  as</span><span>  they  please  with  the  land,  they  have  a</span><span>  large  amount  of  freedom.  So  long  as</span><span>  he  does  not  impoverish  the  farm,  and</span><span>  spoil  it  for  another  tenant,  the  farmer  can</span><span>  grow  what  crops  he  pleases.  Where</span><span>  long  leases  exist  the  tenant  is  free  to</span><span>  follow  any  rotation  of  cropping  he</span><span>  chooses,  till  within  four  years  of  thc</span><span>  end  of  the  term.  In  these  years  he</span><span>  must  not  sell  off  hay,  straw,.  chaff,  ot</span><span>  roots  to  the  detriment  of  his  holding.</span></p> <p><span>  Another  matter  in  which  thc  claims  of</span><span>  tenants  are  meeting  with  recognition  is</span><span>  the  right  they  have  to  unexhausted  im-</span><span>  provements.  The  obstacle  in  this</span><span>  matter  has  been  the  difficulty  of  estima-</span><span>  ting  the  value  of  unexhausted  capital</span><span>  left  in  a  farm.  It  seems  to  be  concluded</span><span>  that  with  care  and  attention  a  class  ol</span><span>  valuers  may  be  created,  on  whom  everj</span><span>  reliance  could  be  placed.  Every  out-</span><span>  going  tenant,  it  is  contended,  should</span><span>  have  absolute  security  to  be  com</span><span>  pensated,  in  respect  of  every  improve-</span><span>  ment  he  may  have  made  upon  his  farm</span><span>  or,  in  other  words,  in  respect  of  every-</span><span>  thing  he  may  have  done  on  or  to  the</span><span>  farm  which  may  have  increased  its</span><span>  letting  value  as  a  farm  ;  and  that  the</span><span>  measure  of  such  compensation  should  be</span><span>  the  value  of  the  improvement  to  the  out-</span><span>  going  tenant's  successor.  From  this  it</span><span>  will  be  seen  that  the  landlords'  profits</span><span>  from  their  farms  are  being  reduced  to</span><span>  the  bare  rent.  The  ""  extras,""  on  which</span><span>  many  of  them  relied  lo  assist  them  in</span><span>  their  contracts,  will  nut  be  available  ir</span></p> <p><span>  future.</span></p> <p><span>  The  course  of  agricultural  agitations</span><span>  and  movements  in  the  old  country  can</span><span>  only  possess  a  secondary  interest  to</span><span>  fanners  in  this  colony.  Here  every  one</span><span>  is  his  own  landlord.  But  land-letting</span><span>  has  already  commenced  ia  our  more</span></p> <p><span>  cultivated  districts,  and  it  is  of  some</span><span>  consequence  that  the  evils  which  have</span><span>  pertained  to  iï  in  the  United  Kingdom</span><span>  and'ilreland,  ""and  have  been  the  source</span><span>  pf  many  troubles,  should  be  carefully</span><span>  avoided.-  This  will  be  done,  if  our</span><span>  farmers,  from  time  to  time,  consider  the</span><span>  points  under  dispute  in  the  home</span><span>  countries..  i°  '  »  .  >  .'</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  criminal  aittings  of  the  District</span><span>  Court,  in  Rockhampton,  a  eonditiou  of  de-</span><span>  pravity  in  the  Drummond  Rango  neighbour-</span><span>  hood  was  disclosed  that*  is  by  no  means</span><span>  gratifying.  From  this  looality  uo  less  than</span><span>  two  cases  of  malicious  wounding  were  brought</span><span>  up.  In  one  instance-that  of  the  man  Paap</span><span>  -it  ie  impossible  any  one  could  fail  to  observe</span><span>  an  amount  of  depravity  that,  in  a  supposed</span><span>  moral  community,,  is  disgusting.  It  would</span><span>  seem  that  this  unfortunate  man  is  possessed</span><span>  of  a  wife  to  whom  he  may  attribute  being</span><span>  branded  as  a  criminal.  This  woman  evidently</span><span>  was  upon  terms  of  improper  intimacy  with</span><span>  the  complainant  Jones,  which  had  aroused  the</span><span>  feelings  of  jealousy  in  her  husband  that  led</span><span>  him  to  commit  tho  offence  of  which  he  was</span><span>  found  guilty,  and  which  might  have</span><span>  brought  him  to  the  gallows.  Paap</span><span>  a  cripple-goaded  to  desperation,-made</span><span>  thc  attack  upon  Jones,  who  admitted</span><span>  the  criminal  intimacy  existing  between  himself</span><span>  and  the  prisoner's  wife.  There  was  something</span><span>  that  appealed  to  the  sympathy  of  all  honest</span><span>  men  in  Paap's  plea  to  the  jury-the  man</span><span>  Jones  had  openly  endeavoured  to  persuade</span><span>  his  wife  to  leave  bim,  had  struck  ànd.  mal-</span></p> <p><span>  treated  him,  atad  lie  had  no  power  to  rid  him-</span><span>  self  of  this  ruffian.  This  contains  the  pith  of</span><span>  the  whole  occurence.  His  Honor,  as  au</span><span>  administrator  of  the  law,  was  bound  to  look</span><span>  upon  the  offence  with  severity.  ""The  law,""</span><span>  ho  observed,  ""must  protect  life  and  limb,""</span><span>  but  how  hard  for  the  weaker  man  to  keep</span><span>  within  the  law,  while  every  feeling  that</span><span>  renders  the  words  home,  ohildren,  brother,</span><span>  sister,  the  loving  ties  upon  which  happiness</span><span>  depends,  was  being  outraged  before  his  eyes.</span><span>  Still  moro  brutally  heartless  is  the  wife's  con-</span><span>  duct  to  willingly  become  the  paramour  of  her</span><span>  husband's  persecutor  and  prosecutor  while  that</span><span>  husband  was  io  prison.  The  other  case  from</span><span>  the  Drummond  Range  did  not  present  the</span><span>  same  features,  but  exhibited  an  amount  of</span><span>  dastardly  cowardice  on  the  part  of  the</span><span>  accused,  that  is  more  aggravated  when  it  is</span><span>  remembered  that  he  and  his  victim  are  fellow</span></p> <p><span>  countrymen-Swedes.

"<p><span>  KOCKIIAMI'  TON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  FEBRUARY  12,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  FROM  the  recurrence,  at  short  intervals,</span><span>  of  discussions  on  the  alienation  of  the</span><span>  public  lands  of  the  colonies,  we  think  it</span><span>  may  be  inferred  that  public  opinion  on</span><span>  this'  question  is  undergoing  a  change.</span><span>  Already  the  people  who  have  not  are</span><span>  looking  askance  on  the  people  who  have</span><span>  land,  and  the  question  is  being  asked</span><span>  why  should  the  land,  which  istlie  common</span><span>  inheritance  of  the  people  of  Australia,  for</span><span>  all  time  coming  be  shut  up  in  the  hands</span><span>  of  a  limited  number  of  individuals  ?  The</span><span>  subject  of  land-holding  is  of  widespread</span><span>  interest,  and  its  importance  will  increase</span><span>  with  that  of  population.  The  axiom  is</span><span>  being  laid  down-that  no  generation  can</span><span>  claim  the  right  to  deal  with  the  land  so</span><span>  as  to  prejudice  the  claims  of  succeeding</span><span>  generations  to  its  enjoyment.  Though</span><span>  this  seems  a  proposition,  of  which</span><span>  the  truth  will  meet  with  general</span><span>  recognition,  it  is  not  one  that  can  be</span><span>  recognised  in  practice,  unless  the  people</span><span>  are  to  be  content  to  wander  about  the</span><span>  country  like  blackfellows.  If  the  prin-</span><span>  ciple  involved  in  the  saying  were  strictly</span><span>  carried  out  there  could  be  no  mining,</span><span>  because  every  ounce  of  gold,  for</span><span>  instance,  taken  out  of  the  land  by  one</span><span>  man,  and  spent  by  him  for  his  own</span><span>  gratification,  would  be  prejudicial  to  the</span><span>  interest  of  the  person  who  succeeded</span><span>  him  on  the  land  where  the  gold  was</span></p> <p><span>  [n*\r\A_XJxo  lntfrrtr  jauld  -  -pnan.My</span></p> <p><span>  get  any  advantage  (rom  the  gold  which</span><span>  had  been  appropriated  by  his  prede-</span><span>  cessor.  In  iike  manner,  if  a  man  cut</span><span>  down,  and  consumed  the  timber  on  a</span><span>  piece  of  country  he  would  by  that  act  be</span><span>  touching  theclaims  of  his  successors.  The</span><span>  farmer  who  crops  the  land  heavily,  who</span><span>  robs  the  soil  of  the  elements  essential</span><span>  to  the  production  of  certain  crops,</span></p> <p><span>  makes  the  land  of  less  value  to  whoever</span><span>  comes  after  him,  From  these  considera-</span><span>  tions  it  will  be  apparent  that  it  would  be</span><span>  impossible  to  deal  with  the  land  at  all,</span><span>  without  some  prejudice  to  the  rights  of</span></p> <p><span>  others.</span></p> <p><span>  Viewing  the  land  as  a  heritage,  it  is</span><span>  argued,  handed  down  to  us  by  the  last</span><span>  generation  in  trust  for  the  next,  we  can</span><span>  fulfil  that  trust  only  by  handing  down</span><span>  to  them  the  same  power  of  dealing  with</span><span>  their  heritage  as  we  have,  and  we  cannot</span><span>  do  that  if  we  alienate  the  land.  If  the</span><span>  land  were  disposed  of  without  an</span><span>  equivalent  value  being  received  there</span><span>  might  be  some  force  in  this  reasoning</span><span>  But  that  is  not  the  case.  The  land  is</span><span>  not  dystroyed.  Its  capabilities  of  yielding</span><span>  food  for  the  occupants  is  unimpared  by</span><span>  a  change  of  owners,  and  if  the  State  which</span><span>  parts  with  it  owns  less  ¡and,  it  perhaps</span><span>  owns  instead  remunerative  public  works</span><span>  of  general  utility,  and  the  benefits  of</span><span>  which  accrue  to  succeeding  generations.</span><span>  In  this  connection  it  is  contended  there</span><span>  can  be  no  personal  ownership  over  that</span><span>  which  cannot  be  produced  by  personal</span><span>  labour,  and  land  being  of  this  charhcter,</span></p> <p><span>  cannot  become  property.  But  we  can-  ]</span><span>  not  produce  minerals  by  personal  labour,</span><span>  and  if  this  argument  is  to  be  recognised,</span><span>  a  man  has  no  right  to  alienate  the  iron</span><span>  ore  ol  which  machinery  is  formed,</span><span>  or  part  with  the  stones  and  lime  with</span></p> <p><span>  which  houses  are  built.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  impossible,  however,  to  regard</span><span>  with  indifference  the  advantages  it  is</span><span>  said  would  be  derived  by  the  adoption</span><span>  of  the  leasing  system  as  applied  to  all</span><span>  public  lands.  At  present  the  bulk  of</span><span>  the  lands  in  New  South  Wales,  it  is</span><span>  alleged,  are  owned  by  persons  who  are</span><span>  paying  the  banks  seven,  eight,  nine,</span><span>  and  even  ten  per  cent,  on  borrowed</span><span>  purchase  money.  That  revenue  has</span><span>  been  diverted  from  its  proper  destina-</span><span>  tion-  the  public  treasury  -  by  land</span><span>  dealers.  If  the  land  of  the  parent</span><span>  colony  were  leased  at  threepence  an</span><span>  acre,  it  is  calculated  the  annual  income</span><span>  from  that  source  would  be  £1,650,000,</span><span>  instead  of  about  £272,053  as  at</span><span>  present.  The  area  of  Crown  lands</span><span>  leased  in  Queensland  in  1881  was</span><span>  273.7Ú3>933  >  and  if  we  could  obtain</span><span>  bul  one  penny  an  acre  of  rent  the</span><span>  annual  revenue  therefrom  would  be</span><span>  upwards  of  one  million  pounds  sterling,</span><span>  and  nearly  as  much  as  we  at  present</span><span>  realise  from  taxation,  and  the  territorial</span><span>  revenue  of  the  Colony.  Were  the</span><span>  lettini;  value  increased  a  penny  an  acre</span><span>  the  proportional  annual  increase  in</span><span>  revenue  would  bc  upwards  of  a  million</span><span>  pounds.  If  lo  this  revenue  were  added</span><span>  the  income  from  public  works,  such  as</span><span>  railways,  the  necessity  for  imposing</span><span>  cither  direct  or  indirect  taxation  would</span><span>  be  completely  obviated,  As  the</span></p> <p><span>  popution/  increases  the  demands  oí</span></p> <p><span>  the  Government  shall  increase-the.</span><span>  public  expenditure  must  naturally</span><span>  grow  greater;  but  at  the  same</span><span>  -time  the  value  of  the  land  will</span><span>  rise  rapidly.  Land,  instead  of  letting  at</span><span>  a  few  pence  an  acre,  will  bring  some</span><span>  shillings.  The  area  of  the.  colon)'  is</span><span>  668,224  square  miles.  Suppose  thal</span></p> <p><span>  400,000  square  miles  were  let  at  one,</span><span>  penny  an  acre,  or  fifty  shillings  a  square</span><span>  mile,  the  annual  revenue  would  be  a</span><span>  million  pounds  sterling.  But  if  the  rent  :</span><span>  were  increased  to  twenty  pence  an  acre,  :</span><span>  the  annual  income  would  then  be  seventy</span><span>  million  sterling.  With  such  an  income,</span></p> <p><span>  added  to  the  revenue  from  remunerative:</span><span>  public  works,  there  would  be  no  neces-</span><span>  sity  for  either  local  or  general  taxation.</span></p> <p><span>  Tim  apparent  inability  of  the  British  I</span><span>  Government  to.  interfere  in  the  labour  traffic</span></p> <p><span>  that  has  been  going  on  in  the  New  Hebrides</span><span>  is  to  be  regretted,  as  nothing  is  more  likely  to</span><span>  prevent  the  possibility  of  obtaining  labour</span><span>  from  there,  under  proper  regulations,  than</span><span>  permitting  indiscriminate  emigration.  So</span><span>  long  as  the  natives  are  fairly  treated  they</span><span>  become  useful  labourers,  and  a  great  acquisi-</span><span>  tion  to  a  semi-tropical  country  -,  but  if  kid-</span><span>  napping  is  permitted  the  result  will  be  to</span><span>  prevent  the  Kanakas  coming  of  their  own  free</span><span>  will.  It  will  be  remembered  that  not  long</span><span>  since,  a  Committee  of,  the  House  ol  Commons,</span><span>  was  appointed  to  inquire  into  the  outrages  iu</span></p> <p><span>  the  South  Pacific,  but  apparently  so  far  no  ?</span><span>  good  result  has  been  obtained.  The  several</span></p> <p><span>  instances  in  which  thc  Islanders  cruelly.</span><span>  butchered  whites  some  months'  ago  will  bc</span><span>  fresh  in  the  memory  of  our  readers  and</span><span>  sn  inquiry  into  the  nausea  that  produced  their</span><span>  treachery  would  have  been  watched  with</span><span>  interest.  Of  course  some  attempt  was  made</span><span>  to  punish  the  natives,  but  there  is  no</span><span>  guarantee  that  the  actual  perpetrators  of  the</span><span>  crimes  wç£gM£he  ones  who  really  suffered,</span><span>  Seeing  ho  ^satisfactory  the  statement  of</span><span>  Lord  Dertj  is  with  reference  to  thc  New</span><span>  Hebrides,  and  hearing  nothing  of  the  Com-</span><span>  mission  of  Inquiry  into  the  outrages,  it  seems</span><span>  the  prospect  of  affairs  in  the  Pacific  beiug</span></p> <p><span>  ameliorated  is  rather  remote.  The  Kanaka</span></p> <p><span>  !  is  of  great  importance  to  Queensland.  The</span><span>  men  have  been  found  good  workers  and  con-</span><span>  tented,  and  the  difficulty  in  obtaining  them  is</span><span>  not  on  account  of  the  treatment  they  get  in</span><span>  this  colony,-or  at  the  hands  of  our  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  but  on  the  account  of  the  way  in  which</span><span>  unscrupulous  persons-principally  seeking</span></p> <p><span>  labour  for  South  America-treat  them.</span></p> <p><span>  TUB  Customs  collections  at  this  port  from</span><span>  the  1st  to  the  10th  inclusive,  amounted  to</span></p> <p><span>  £2633  Os.  4d.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court  on  Saturday  morning</span><span>  before  the  Police  Magistrate,  a  drunkard  was</span><span>  cautioned  and  discharged.</span></p> <p><span>  PROFESSOR  and  Madame  Lorenski  gave  an</span><span>  entertainment  iu  the  Theatre  Royal  on</span><span>  Saturday  night.

The  population  ot  Prussia,  in-</span><span>  creased  between  1816  and  1801  from  10,350,000</span><span>  to  19,260,000,  while  up  to  1875,  inclusive^</span><span>  had  mounted  up  to  21,500,000,  or  105  percent</span><span>  in  sixty  years.  From  1875  to  18S0  the  popu-</span><span>  lation  of  all  the  German  States  has  been  in-</span><span>  creasing  at  about  525.000  per  annum.  At  the</span><span>  'lastjcensos,  in  December,  1880,  the  number  of</span></p> <p><span>  inhabitants  was  45,250,000,  which,  if  main-</span><span>  tained  at  the  same  rate,  would  be  00,000,000</span><span>  in  1900.  The  increase,  as  compared  with!</span><span>  that  of  France,  is  very  remarkable,</span></p> <p><span>  the  French  population  during  the  last'</span><span>  five  years  showing  an  increase  of  only!</span><span>  389,000;  while  the  increase  of  the  Ger-1</span><span>  man  population  daring  the  same  period  was  .</span><span>  2.000,000,  the  birth-rate  in  the  latter  country  1</span><span>  being  3  91  per  100,  whereas  in  France  it  is  :</span><span>  only  2'47.  There  is  also  this  great  difference</span><span>  between  the  two,  that  in  France  the  increase</span></p> <p><span>  has  been  almost  entirely  in  the  large  towns,  1</span><span>  whereas  in  Germany  the  increase  is  general</span><span>  throughout  the  country  as  well  as  the  towns.</span><span>  The  number  of  immigrants  that  have  left</span><span>  Germany  during  the  last  silty  years  is  over</span><span>  3,500.000,  of  whom  the  greater  part  have</span></p> <p><span>  taken  their  departure  within  the  last  thirty  :</span><span>  years,  the  Ignited  States  having  absorbed  in</span><span>  1881  no;less  than  248,323.  Dr.  Friederich</span><span>  Kappe  estimates  the  amount  taken  away  by</span><span>  each  emigrant  at  no  less  than  450  marks,  or</span><span>  '£22  10J.,  eo  that  the  «apital  transferred  to</span><span>  fche^nited  States  during  last  year  amounted</span><span>  directly  to  £6,587,267.  And  this,  it  should</span><span>  be  remembered,  ¡8  not  returnable  to  Germany</span><span>  in  the  ordinary  ways  of  trade  or  commerce,</span><span>  aa,  iopoint  of  fact,  the  German  emigrants  to</span><span>  the  United  States  become  Americans,  and,</span><span>  consequently,  competitors  with  Germany  in</span></p> <p><span>  agricultural  and  industrial  pursuits.  Dr.</span><span>  Engel  considers  that  the  cost  of  bringing  np  a</span><span>  young  person  of  the  lower  or  middle  classes</span><span>  to  the  fifteenth  year  is  about  £200,  and  he</span><span>  estimates  that  thc  loss  to  Germany  during  the</span><span>  emigration  of  the  last  sixty  years,  in  cash  and</span><span>  valuables  taken  by  each  emigrant,  at  over  nine</span><span>  milliards  of  marks,  nearly  twice  the  amount</span><span>  of  thc  war  iudeinnity  paid  by  France  in  1871.</span></p> <p><span>  CLYDE  SHIPPINC.-The  tonnage  of  shipping</span><span>  launched  from  the  shipbuilding  yards  on  thc</span><span>  Clyde  during  November,  1882,  amounted,  tho</span><span>  Scotsman  states,  to  47,310  tons,  and  largely</span><span>  exceeds  that  of  any  previous  month,  being</span><span>  5500  tous  over  the  output  in  June  (41,810</span><span>  tons.  )  As  compared  with  thc  tonnage  launched</span><span>  in  the  corresponding  month  in  1881,  Novem-</span><span>  ber,  1882,  shows  an  increase  bf  14,944  tons,</span><span>  and  as  compared  with  the  previous  ten</span><span>  months'  average,  the  increase  is  17,456.  For</span><span>  the  eleven  monthB  the  total  of  345,845  tons  is</span><span>  64,044  tons  over  that  of  the  Esme  period  last</span><span>  year,  and  more  than  double  that  of'  1879,</span><span>  The  eleven  months'  output  of  the  year  ie</span><span>  13,977  tons  over  the  aggregate  tonnage  built</span><span>  during  the  whole  of  1881.  Of  the  vessels</span><span>  launched  there  were  15  steamers,  1  hopper</span><span>  dredger,  9  sailing  ships,  and  3  iron  flats.  The</span><span>  sailing  ships  .lauuehed  reached  in.  all  15,266</span><span>  tons-nearly  three  times  the  total  pf  any  other</span><span>  month  of  1882.  Two  of  the  steamers  aggre-</span><span>  gated  10,100  tone,  and  five  others  11,800  tons.</span><span>  The  average  size  of  the  vessels  launched  in</span><span>  November  was  1700  tons,  and  during  the</span><span>  eleven  months  1360  tons,  as  against  1200  and</span><span>  1320  tons  respectively  for  the  pprreaponding</span><span>  periods  last1  year.-  The  number  of  vessels  in</span><span>  course  of  construction  is  ,133,  a  decrease  of</span><span>  'seven  as  compared  With  the  number  at  the</span><span>  close  of  October,  and  21  less  than  at  the  close</span><span>  of  May.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  THE  TELEPHONE</span></p> <p><span>  SYSTEM.-The  marvellous  growth  of  the  tele-</span><span>  phone  system  during  the  six  years  (nearly)</span><span>  that  have  elapsed  since  that  instrument  was</span><span>  brought  out  is  well  shown  by  statistics  recently</span><span>  published  by  the  Compagnie  Internationale</span><span>  des  Telephones,  and  relating  to  telephonic</span><span>  systems  throughout  the  world  at  the  beginning</span><span>  of  October,  1882.  The  compilation  is  neces-</span><span>  sarily    incomplete    somewhat  as  regards</span><span>  small  and  distant  places,  but  the  value  of  the</span><span>  main  results  is  not  thereby  much  impaired.</span><span>  It  is  in  America,  of  course,  where  telephony  is</span><span>  freer  than  on  this  side,  that  the  development</span><span>  has  been  greatest.  New  York  counts  4060</span><span>  subscribers  ;  Chicago,  2726  ;  Cincinnati,  1880  ;</span><span>  Boston.  10,325  ;  San  Francisco,  1300,  &c.</span><span>  Some  of  these  figures  refer  to  May.  There  are</span><span>  now  in  the  United  States  more  than  100,000</span><span>  subscribers,  and  cortain  small  towns,  with</span><span>  population  less  than  1000,  have  yet  thirty  to</span><span>  lifty  telephonic  subscribers,  some  even</span><span>  more,  As  regards  the  absolute  number</span><span>  of  subscribers,  Paris  comes  third,  after</span><span>  New  York  and  Chicago  ;  it  had  on  October  1</span><span>  no  fewer  than  2,422  subscribers,  while  London</span><span>  had  only  1,900.  Amsterdam  700,  Stockholm</span><span>  672,  Vienna  900,  Berlin  581,  Brussels  450,</span><span>  Turin  410,  Copenhagen  400,  Mexico,  300,  St.</span><span>  Petersburg  145,  and  Alexandria  118.  While</span><span>  the  annual  subscription  is  600  francs  in  Paris,</span><span>  500  francs  in  London,  and  409  francs  in  the</span><span>  provincial  towns  of  France,  it  descends  to</span><span>  300  francs  and  200  francs  in  Belgium,  135</span><span>  francs  and  130  francs  in  Italy,  and  only  120</span></p> <p><span>  francs  in  Switzerland.  A  calculation  of  the</span><span>  ratio  of  the  number  of  subscribers  to  that  of</span></p> <p><span>  inhabitants  for  each  town  reveals  a  goodly</span></p> <p><span>  number  of  small  towns  in  America  where</span></p> <p><span>  there  is  a  telephone  for  every  twenty  inhab-</span><span>  itants  ;  in  Chicago  and  in  Zurich,  the  pro-</span><span>  portion  is  about  one  per  200  ;  in  New  York,</span><span>  one  per  500  ;  in  Brussels,  one  per  800  ;  in</span><span>  Paris,  about  one  per  1,000  ;  in  Berlin,  one  per</span><span>  2.000  ;  in  London,  one  per  3,000  ;  and  in  St.</span><span>  Petersburg,  only  one  per  4,000.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  STATE  OF  IRELAND.-A  correspondent</span><span>  writing  to  the  St.  James's  Gazette,  December</span><span>  8,  describing  a  short  visit  to  Ireland,  says,</span><span>  ""  Though  a  native  of  the  Green  Isle,  and</span><span>  having  Bpent  forty  years  of  my  life  there,  and</span><span>  therefore  well  acquainted  with  its  people,  I</span></p> <p><span>  do  not  remember  ever  to  have  found  intelli-</span><span>  gent  and  enterprising  Irishmen  of  all  classes</span><span>  and  creeds  eo  hopeless  and  dispirited,'  I</span><span>  speak  not  of  landlords  and  agents,  but  of</span><span>  manufacturers,  merchants,  professional  men</span><span>  'men  of  light  and  leading,'  whose  future  is</span><span>  bound  up  with  the  country.  The  lawyers,  it</span><span>  is  true,  are  reaping  a  harvest.  The  land</span><span>  laws  are  occupying  every  solicitor  and</span><span>  solicitor's  derk,  in  some  places  night  and</span><span>  day  ;  but  everything  else  is  at  a  standstill.</span><span>  The  labourers  are  unemployed.  All  improve-</span><span>  ments  in  land  have  ceased.  In  the  fairs  and</span><span>  markets  you  see  ragged  peasants  driving  fat</span><span>  pigs  to  bc  sold  ;  the  pigs  aro  fat,  but  the  men</span></p> <p><span>  are  half-starved.  Graziers  and  cattle  dealers</span></p> <p><span>  also  fl'iurish  ;  but  thc  potato  crop  is  a  failure,</span></p> <p><span>  and  thc  fuel  is  unsaved.  To  usc  a  common  ex-  ¡</span><span>  pression,  God  only  knows  what  is  to  become</span><span>  of  thc  poor.  Another  Arrears  Bill  will  he</span><span>  wanted  next  year.  I  will  give  you  two  or</span><span>  three  facts  of  another  kind,  which  will  show</span><span>  the  effect  of  this  reign  of  terror  and  plunder.</span><span>  First,  property  purchased  20  years  ago  with  a</span><span>  parliamentary  title,  and  costing  27  years'</span><span>  purchase,  cannot  now  be  sold  for  17  years'</span><span>  purchase.  The  tenants  will  not  buy  ;  they</span><span>  are  better  off  as  they  are.  Capitalists  will</span><span>  not  buy.  There  is  no  settled  and  civilised</span><span>  state  in  tho  world  where  property  is  not  more</span><span>  securo  than  in  Ireland.  Secondly,  I  have</span><span>  applied  to  several  assurance  companies  to</span><span>  assure  mills  and  other  property  in  Ulster,  and</span><span>  all  have  declined  risks  in  Ireland.  Thirdly,</span><span>  mer  who  have  bad,  or  thought  they  had,  pro-</span><span>  perty  in  Ireland  formerly  had  no  difficulty  in</span><span>  raising  a  moderate  amount  (say  one-third  the</span><span>  value),  on  mortgage  ;  now  one  of  the  largest</span><span>  dealers  in  trust  funds  in  Lancashire  publicly</span><span>  stated  that  he  would  no  more  invest  money  in</span><span>  Ireland  than  bc  would  in  the  Turkish  debt  or</span><span>  Zulu  bonds,  if  there  were  such  securities.</span><span>  What  is  to  become  of  my  unhappy  country  Î</span><span>  At  thc  present  time  there  is  not  a  single  gleam</span><span>  of  light.""</span></p> <p><span>  REMARKABLE  CASE  or  MISTAKEN  IDENTITY.</span><span>  -A  most  remarkable  case  of  mistaken</span></p> <p><span>  identity  took  plitce  in  connection  with  the</span><span>  suicide  which  occurred  on  the  tramway  in</span><span>  Elizabeth-street,  Sydney,  on  the  16th  ultimo.</span><span>  For  some  time  after  the  occurrence  the</span><span>  deceased  remained  unidentified.  The  city</span><span>  coroner,  on  the  ISth  instant,  commenced  an</span><span>  inquest  on  thc  body,  aud  a  woman,  giving  the</span><span>  name  of  Jane  Fowler,  and  describing  horself</span><span>  as  a  dressmaker  living  in  Goulhurn-street,</span><span>  who  had  viewed,  the  body  of  the  deceaned  in</span><span>  thc  Sydney  Hospital  morgue,  was  called  to</span><span>  give  evidence.  She  swore  positively  that  th«</span><span>  body  was  that  of  ber  husbaud,  and  tendered</span><span>  other  testimony  with  regard  to  his  identifica-</span><span>  tion,  Sis  name,  one  «aid,  WM  John  Fowler,</span></p> <p><span>  and  be  had  been  living  apart  from  her  for  the</span><span>  last  two  years.  Her  evidence  waa  taken</span><span>  down  in  the  customary  manner  by  the</span><span>  coroner,  and  at  the  conelnsion  -of  the</span><span>  inquest  the  jury  found  that  the  -aaid</span><span>  John  Fowler  had  committed  suicide  by  throw-</span><span>  ing  himself  in  front  of  a  tram  motor.  The</span><span>  deceased  was  buried  in  due  course.  To  the</span></p> <p><span>  [  great  astonishment  of  Mrs.  Jane  Fowler  her</span></p> <p><span>  husband  presented  himself  iu  the  flesh  at  her</span><span>  house  yesterday.  She  was  so  astonished  at</span><span>  first  that  she  could  not  account  for  the  circum-</span></p> <p><span>  stances  at  the'  time,  but  ultimately  She  dis-  i</span><span>  covered  that  she  had  mistaken  the  deceased  i</span><span>  for  her  husband,  and  had  unknowingly  sworn</span><span>  to  his  identification.  Io  appearance  tho</span></p> <p><span>  deceased  very  much  resembled  the  individual1</span><span>  for  whom  the  wife  of  the  latter  had  taken.</span><span>  him.  The  matter  was  made  known  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  coroner  yesterday  afternoon  by  a  visit  to</span></p> <p><span>  that  gentleman's  office  ot  Mr.  and  Mrs..</span><span>  Fowler,  accompanied  by  their  son,  who  was</span><span>  Srepared  to  bear  testimony  to  the  fact  that</span></p> <p><span>  is  mother  had  altogether  mistaken  another.</span><span>  man  for  his  father  on  the  occasion  referred  to.</span></p> <p><span>  Up  to  the  present  time  it  is  not  known  who  '</span></p> <p><span>  the  deceased  man  is.  j</span></p> ",Article,1883-02-12,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  AUGUST  4,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  WEER.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  thunder  of  political  strife  now  rever-</span><span>  berates  in  all  parts  of  the  Colony.  From</span><span>  Brisbane  in  the  south  to  Caps  York  in  the  far</span><span>  north,  preparations  for  tho  General  Election</span><span>  are  going  on,  aud  candidates  and  their  friends</span><span>  are  busy  and  excited.  Side  issues  and  local</span><span>  objects  are  being  dwarfed  by  the  growing</span><span>  prominence  of  the  great  questions  on  which</span><span>  the  constituencies  are  to  be  called  upon  to</span><span>  deliver  their  verdict.  Considerable  iuterest</span><span>  has  been  displayed  in  this  electorate  in  the</span><span>  political  movements  in  Brisbane.  Last  Satur-</span><span>  day  the  hon.  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  issued</span><span>  an  Address  to  the  constituency  of  North</span><span>  brisbane,  in  which  be  anncuncod  his  scheme</span><span>  for  carrying  on  railway  construction  in  the</span><span>  colony.  At  Mackay,  it  will  bo  remembered,</span><span>  the  hon.  gentleman  said  he  would  act  tho</span><span>  part  of  the  physician,  and  not  prescribe</span><span>  for  the  better  management  of  public  affairs</span><span>  till  he  was  called  in  to  do  so.  He  considers</span><span>  an  invitation  has  now  been  issued  to  him,  and</span><span>  he  comes  forward  with  his  prescription.  It  is</span><span>  that  instead  of  paying  for  the  railways  with</span><span>  liud-gronto,  «ba  oolany  should  guarantee</span><span>  Interest  on  thc  money  used  in  their  construc-</span><span>  tion.  Till  we  have  the  Address  in  full,  and</span><span>  the  hon.  gentleman's  exposition  of  it,  wc  are</span><span>  not  in  a  position  to  comment  upon  thc  pro-</span><span>  posal  ;  but  it  seems  to  us  that  it  implies  the</span></p> <p><span>  introduction  of  that  horrible  creature,  born</span><span>  of  a  limpet  on  a  rock  and  a  horse-leech</span><span>  whose  name  is  Syndicate.  It  may  be  neces-</span><span>  sary,  therefore,  for  the  electors  to  consider</span><span>  whether  the  syudicate  ie  deserving  of  all</span><span>  the  hard  things  which  have  been  said</span><span>  and  circulated  about  it  by  the  Opposition.  A</span><span>  most  notable  event  h  SB  been  there-appearance</span><span>  of  Mr.  John  Douglas,  C.  M.G.,  on  tho  political</span><span>  stage.  He  has  oome  forward  as  a  candidate</span><span>  for  the  suffrages  of  the  electors  of  North  Bris-</span><span>  bane,  not  so  much  because  he  is  anxious  for</span><span>  Parliamentary  honours  as  that  he  is  desirous</span><span>  of  pointing  out  the  inutility  of  Mr.  Griffith's</span><span>  scheme  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the</span><span>  country.  It  is  a  desperate  blow  to  the  Liberal</span><span>  canse,  when  the  Premier  of  the  laBt  Liberal</span><span>  administration  turns  round,  and  condemns  the</span><span>  policy  of  his  former  colleague  and  successor.</span><span>  Mr.  Douglas  must  be  very  firmly  convinced</span><span>  that  Mr.  Griffith  is  wrong,  and  must  be</span><span>  alarmed  at  his  proposals,  when  he  can  take</span><span>  suoh  a  decided  step.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Hon.  A.  Archer,  Colonial  Treasnrer,  ia</span><span>  oar  only  candidate  who  has  addressed  his  con-</span><span>  stituents,  and  a  report  of  his  speech,  which</span><span>  we  have  given  at  length,  is  deserving  of  care-</span><span>  ful  perusal.  Above  all  others,  the  points  of</span><span>  particular  interest  in  it  are  the  decided  opinion</span><span>  the  Hon.  gentleman  has  that  we  shall</span><span>  not  be  able  to  go  on  borrowing  more  money</span><span>  to  construct  public  works.  With  peculiar</span><span>  emphasis  he  remarked  that  the  last  loan  was</span><span>  not  a  successful  affair,  and  such  an  observation,</span><span>  coming  from  the  head  of  our  financial  depart-</span><span>  ment,  is  deeply  significant.  His  exposition</span><span>  of  the  manner  in  which  the  land-grant</span><span>  system  is  to  be  employed  in  preventing  a  re-</span><span>  currence  of  those  timcB  of  depression  to  which</span><span>  thc  colony  has  been  exposed,  is  singularly  in-</span><span>  teresting.  Electors  canuot  consider  the</span><span>  matter,  as  expounded  by  Mr.  Archer,  too</span><span>  carefully.</span></p> <p><span>  IT  is  aim  oe  t  needless  to  remark  ti)  at  a  good</span><span>  doa)  of  excitement  haa  sprung  up  in  Rock-</span><span>  hampton.  At  the  beginning  of  the  week  it</span><span>  seemed  as  if  Mr.  Ferguson  was  to  bo  allowed  a</span><span>  walk  over,  but  there  are  now  a  number  of</span><span>  candidates  in  thc  field.  Mr.  Ferguson  lias  not</span><span>  iesued  an  address  to  his  constituents  as</span><span>  all  the  other  candidates  have  done,  but</span><span>  wilt  make  a  speech  in  the  Hall  of  the</span><span>  School  of  Arts  on  Monday  evening.  Mr.</span><span>  Macdonald  Paterson  is  again  a  candidate</span><span>  and  in  a  brief  address  forwarded  from  Bris-</span><span>  bane,  intimates  that  be  will  be  with  the</span><span>  electors  in  a  few  days.  A  very  interesting</span><span>  and  carefully  prepared  address  bas  been</span><span>  issued  by  Mr.  L.  F.  Lauds  berg,  but  we  ore</span><span>  afraid  that  gentleman  may  spare  himself  the</span><span>  trouille  of  expounding  it  before  the  electors</span><span>  in  public  meeting  assembled.  Mr.  W.</span><span>  Higson,  who  opposed  Mr.  Ferguson  at  the</span><span>  Inst  election  held  in  Rockhampton,  is  again  ia</span><span>  the  field  as  a  candidate  ;  and  bas  i86ned  an</span><span>  excellent  Address.  Of  course  wo  do  not  agree</span><span>  with  Mr.  Higson,  but  ho  has  put  his  views</span><span>  before  thc  electors  in  a  form  which  placeB</span><span>  them  beyond  the  reach  of  misinter-</span><span>  pretation.  In  Mr.  Robert  Lynns  *'  thc</span><span>  well  known  and  popular  solicitor  ""  wc</span><span>  recognise  thc  candidate  so  h»ng  ago  promised</span><span>  by  our  contemporary.  Thou  e;  h  he  announces</span><span>  himself  as  a  native  of  Australia-tho  only</span><span>  pure  merino  in  thc  wlioh:  urowd-he  is  a</span><span>  somewhat  piebald  politician.  Hu  is  opposed</span><span>  to  land-grant  railways,  but#will  permit  Ihe</span><span>  introduction  nf  Coolies  for  sugar  cultivation.</span><span>  A  KedislriWinu  of  Si-nts  lütt  is  now  due  in</span><span>  Parliament,  and  will  be  introduced  hy  what-</span><span>  ever  party  is  itt  power,  so  that  Mr.  Lyons</span><span>  plays  a  safe  card  iu  turning  that  up.  Mr.</span><span>  Hoes  Jone?,  in  answer  to  a  most  respectably</span><span>  signed  requisition,  has  intimated  his  willing-</span><span>  ness  lo  become  a  candidate,  and  will  issue  his</span><span>  Ad?!ress  to-day.  Il  ia  possible  the  number  of</span><span>  candidates  may  bc  increased,  as  there  is  not  a</span><span>  tloeidcd  Ministerialist  among  them.  In  the</span><span>  sifting  process  that  is  certain  to  take  place</span><span>  next  week,  some  gentlemen  may  find  them-</span></p> <p><span>  selves  eet  aside.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  th«  meeting  of  the  Municipal  Council  on</span><span>  Thursday  last  there  waa  an  unusual  amount</span><span>  of  business  disposed  of,  although  it  was  got</span><span>  through  very  quickly.  Among  the  cot  res-</span><span>  póndenos  was  a  letter  from  the  Under-</span><span>  secretary  for  Lands,  who  forwarded  the</span><span>  Attoruey-Generat'a  opinion  on  the  alignmout</span><span>  of  the  town,  reoeutly  carried  out  by  Mr.</span><span>  Wood.  From  it  we  gather  that  the  reasons  it</span><span>  I  has  not  been  confirmed  was  owing  to  ignorauce</span></p> <p><span>  of  some  point  ol  law  on  which,  however,  the</span><span>  Council  were  informed  hy  the  Town  Clerk,</span><span>  the  viewa  of  the  officials  had  been  set  right  by</span><span>  Mr.  Jones.  It  is  satisfactory,  however,  to  know</span><span>  thatthemethodof  survey  adopted  by  Mr.  Wood</span><span>  is  considered  to  be  suitable  for  the  town,  and</span><span>  that  it  has  been  prepared  with  care.  Areply  was</span><span>  received  from  the  Secretary  of  the  Gas  Com-</span><span>  pany  to  the  request  to  make  a  reduction  in</span><span>  the  Corporation  account  for  the  last  three</span><span>  months.  The  Company  were  willing  to  take</span><span>  five  per  cent  off  it,  but  this  was  not  considered</span><span>  satisfactory  by  the  members  of  the  Council.</span><span>  The  most  important  letter  received  was  that</span><span>  from  Messrs.  Howard  Smith  and  Sons,</span><span>  in  which  reference  wa«  made  to  the</span><span>  ""lifting""  of  valuable  packages  of  goods</span><span>  from  the  wharves.  As  a  remedy  for  this  it</span><span>  was  suggested  that  the  Counoil  should  erect</span><span>  au  enolosed  shed  at  the  lower  end  of  the  Cor-</span><span>  poration  Wharf,  the  cost  of  which  was</span><span>  estimated  at  £1000.  If  tho  improvements</span><span>  were  carried  out,  they  would  be  willing  to  pay</span><span>  10  per  cent  per  annum  on  the  cost  of  construc-</span><span>  tion,  and  enter  into  an  agreement  to  that</span><span>  effeot.  The  matter  was  favourably  received</span><span>  by  the  Council,  and  referred  to  the  Wharfage</span><span>  Committee.  The  advantage  of  an  enclosed</span><span>  shed  on  the  wharf  must  be  apparent  to  all,</span><span>  and  it  may  be  anticipated  that  the  Committee</span><span>  will  recommend  the  carrying  out  of  the  work</span><span>  as  soon  as  funds  are  at  thc  disposal</span><span>  of  the  Council.  We  had  thought  the</span><span>  site  for  the  (dring  of  the  ti&lt;nc-gun</span><span>  had  been  fixed,  hut  from  what  was</span><span>  said  at  the  Council  meeting  on  Thursday  it</span><span>  appears  that  thia  was  not  the  cass.  Only  one</span><span>  tender  was  received  for  tho  work,  that  of  W.</span><span>  J.  Cumming  for  £1  a  week,  which  was</span><span>  accepted.  Though  the  site  where  it  is  to  be</span><span>  fired  from  was  left  in  thc  hands  of  the  Works</span><span>  Committee,  it  was  evidently  understood'  by</span><span>  the  Town  Clerk  that  it  was  to  be  fired  from</span><span>  the  Quarry  as  he  inserted  that  in  the  specifica-</span><span>  tions,  but  the  tenderer  suggested  the  Ferry</span><span>  Reserve  at  North  Rockhampton  as  a  suit-</span><span>  able  place.</span></p> ",Article,1883-08-04,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  ?ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  SEPTEMBER  6,  1683.</span></p> <p><span>  TWP  arrniintc  iwtii-K  &lt;-»~  t""  =</span><span>  nave  reached  us,  as  to  the  continued  ill-</span><span>  ness  of  the  Cornie  de  Chambord,  have</span><span>  at  last  culminated  in  a  telegram  an-</span><span>  nouncing  his  death  at  Frohsdorf  on  the</span><span>  24th  ultimo.  Born  in  Paris  on  the  291h</span><span>  September,  1820,  the  latter  part  of  the</span><span>  life  of  this  prince  was  one  of  perpetual</span><span>  exile,  and  was  a  strange  contradiction  to</span><span>  the  splendour  and  pomp  which  attended</span><span>  his  earlier,  years.  As  grandson  of</span><span>  Charles  X,  and  son.  of  the  Due  de  Berri,</span><span>  the  heir  presumptive  to  that  monarch,</span><span>  Henri  Comte  de  Chambord  was  the</span><span>  rightful  and  direct  successor  to  the</span><span>  throne  of  his  ancestors.  His  birth,</span><span>  indeed,  took  place  under  rather  excep-</span><span>  tional  circumstances,  for  his  father,</span><span>  the  Duke  de  Berri,  who  was  mur-</span><span>  dered  in  February,  1820,  left  only</span><span>  a  daughter,  and  the  joy  was  great</span><span>  when  seven  months  afterwards  his</span><span>  widow  give  birth  tn  a  nrinrp.  «An</span><span>  received  the  tule  of  Due  de  Bordeaux,</span><span>  his  tide-of  Comte  de  Charcbord  being</span><span>  derived  from  the  Castle  of  Chambord,</span><span>  which  was  subsequently  presented  to</span><span>  him.  He  was  baptised  amid  circum-</span><span>  stances  of  great  pomp,  with  water</span><span>  brought  by  M.  de  Chateaubriand  from</span><span>  the  river  Jordan,  and  received  the  appel-</span><span>  lation  of  ""  the  Child  of  Miracles.""  On</span><span>  the  .abdication  of  Charles  X,  at  the</span><span>  Revolution  in  1830,  this  prince  named</span><span>  the  youthful  Due  de  Bordeaux  as  his</span><span>  successor,  but  the  people  insisted  on  the</span><span>  elevation  to  the  throne  of  Louis  Phillippe,</span><span>  the  citizen  Kling,  and  the  elder  branch</span><span>  of  Bourbons  were  consequently  banished</span></p> <p><span>  into  exile.</span></p> <p><span>  During  the  subsequent  changes  that</span><span>  took  .place  in  the  Government  of  France,</span><span>  the  Comte  de  Chambord  always  main-</span><span>  tained  an  inflexibleattitude.lhatof  king  by</span><span>  divine  right,  and  refused  to  comply  with</span><span>  any  conditions,  the  acceptance  of  which</span><span>  might  at  one  time  have  secured  him</span><span>  restoration  to  the  throne  of  his  ancestors.</span><span>  The  now  famous  proclamation,  in  which</span><span>  he  demanded  that  the  white  flag  of  the</span><span>  Bourbons  should  replace  the  tricolour  as</span><span>  as  the  banner  of  France,  alienated  from</span><span>  him  a  large  section  of  his  supporters,  and</span><span>  Marshel  M'Mahon  is  said  to  have  made</span><span>  the  shrewd  remark,  that  the  Chassepots</span><span>  of  .  the  soldiers  would  go  off  of  them-</span><span>  selves,  if  they  were  to  hear  of  the</span><span>  sacrifice  of  the  tricolour.  With  the  death</span><span>  of  the  Count  de  Chambord  the  direct</span><span>  line  of  the  Bourbons  has  ceased  to  exist,</span><span>  and  henceforth  the  Count  de  Paris,  tht</span><span>  Orleanist  .claimant  and  the  representative</span><span>  of  the  line  of  Louis  Phillippe,  unites  ir</span><span>  Iiis  own  person  the  claims  of  tlx</span><span>  .  Legitimist  and  Orleanist  houses  to  thc</span></p> <p><span>  throne.  Whether  indeed  this  wil</span><span>  be  any  further  advantage  to  the  Conn</span><span>  ?de  Paris  remains  for  future  event:</span><span>  to  decide,  but  undoubtedly  he  will  nov</span></p> <p><span>  hp  able  to  reckon  on  a  verv  Jaree  ant</span></p> <p><span>  powerful  addition  to  his  supporters,  and</span><span>  will  also  have  at  his  badi,  the  whole</span><span>  strength  of  the  Catholic  Church,  which</span><span>  was  before  accorded  to  his  cousin  the</span><span>  late  Comte  dc  Chambord.  The  French</span><span>  Republic,  therefore,  will  now  have  to</span><span>  face  one  powerful  opponent,  instead  of</span><span>  two  jealous  and  antagonistic  pretenders  ;</span><span>  and  already  the  telegraph  tells  us  of</span><span>  placards  appearing  on  the  walls  in  varions</span><span>  parts  of  Paris,  favouring  the  claims  of</span><span>  the  Comte  de  Paris  to  the  throne.</span><span>  Whether  any  active  attempt  to  put  for-</span><span>  ward  will  be  made  his  claims  must  at  least</span><span>  be  doubtful,  and  he  will  most  likely  bide</span><span>  his  time  and  wait  on  circumstances.</span><span>  Any  chance  he  might  really  possess  must</span><span>  come  from  the  action  of  the  Republican</span><span>  Government.  If  that  Government  had</span><span>  seriously  damaged  or  disqualified</span><span>  itself  in  tile  eyes  of  thc  majority  of</span></p> <p><span>  Frenchmen,  and  if  there  were  an  evident</span></p> <p><span>  desire  rm  their  part  to  try  a  new  ex-</span><span>  periment,  then  cine  might  imagine</span><span>  there  would  bc  a  good  opportunity  for</span><span>  the  Connie  de  I'.iris  to  step  in,  and</span><span>  poiot  to  the  advantage  of  a  settled</span><span>  monarchy,  on  a  thoroughly  popular  basis,</span></p> <p><span>  which  would  also  combine  with  it  the</span><span>  prestige  of  ""  king  by  divine  right,""  Such</span><span>  an  offer  might  not  be  accepted,  or  if  it</span><span>  was,  might  not  be  put  to  a  very  pro-</span><span>  longed  trial.  But  in  any  case  it  would  be</span><span>  necessary,  as  a  preliminary  condition,</span><span>  for  the  French  nation  to  be  thoroughly</span><span>  dissatisfied  with  the  operation  of  the</span><span>  Republican  form  of  Government.</span><span>  At  present  such  a  condition  of</span><span>  things  is  nowhere  visible  in  France.</span><span>  The  Republic  has,  of  course,  enemies</span><span>  at  home  as  well  as  foes  abroad,  and  has</span><span>  therefore  both  external  and  internal</span><span>  dangers  to  guard  against  But  for  all</span><span>  this,  there  appears  not  the  slightest  6¡gn</span><span>  that  the  majority  of  the  French  people</span><span>  have  any  desire  to  give  up  the  Repub-</span><span>  lican  form  of  government  in  favour  of</span><span>  any  new  experiment,  nor  can  it  be</span><span>  supposed  that  they  will  relinquish  the</span><span>  Republican  system  for  the  sake  of  trying</span><span>  once  again  an  old  experiment,  already</span><span>  tried  and  discredited.  The  Comte  de</span><span>  Chambord  was,  during  his  life  time,</span><span>  looked  up  to  by  the  Legitimist  party  as</span><span>  a  sort  of  tutelary  deity,  and  his  dignified</span><span>  retirement  at  Frohsdorf,  and  the  un-</span><span>  yielding  attitude  he  maintained  with</span><span>  regard  to  his  claims  to  the  throne,  com-</span><span>  pelled  some  measure  of  respect  from</span><span>  men  of  all  parties,  There  is,  however,</span><span>  nothing  particularly  fascinating  in  the</span><span>  careers  of  the  Orleanist  Princes.  Living</span><span>  under  the  Republic,  and  until  recently</span><span>  holding  commissions  in  the  Republican</span><span>  army,  they  have  as  it  were  recognised  its</span><span>  authority,  while  in  reality  they  were</span><span>  plotting  and  attempting  to  destroy  it,  and</span><span>  the  discovery  of  these  attempts  led  to</span><span>  their  exile.  There  is  nothing  in  this  to</span><span>  appeal  to  the  feelings  or  sensibilities  of</span><span>  the  French  people.  The  Count  de  Paris</span><span>  has  as  yet  rendered  no  services  to  the</span><span>  nation,  and  has  'performed  no  action</span><span>  which  has  called  forth  their  admiration</span><span>  and  applause.  Even  if  France  were</span></p> <p><span>  now  crying  out  for  a  rung  or  ümperor,</span><span>  at  the  present  moment  there  is  no</span><span>  claimant  for  the  throne,  whose  personal</span><span>  position  and  qualifications  fasten  the  eyes</span><span>  of  all  men  on  him,  and  make  the  voices</span><span>  of  all  exclaim,  ""  This  is  he.""  If  Gam-</span><span>  betta  had  lived,  he  was  the  one  rpan  to</span><span>  whom  the  French  nation  would  have</span><span>  turned  in  the  hour  of  doubt  and  adver-</span></p> <p><span>  sity,  but  the  Comte  de  Paris  possesses</span><span>  no  such  claim  to  the  respect  and  admira-</span><span>  tion  of  the  French  people.

There  is  nothing  of</span><span>  the  kind  in  what  is  now  happening  in</span><span>  Europe.  The  death  of  the  Comte  de</span><span>  Chambord  will  make  no  real  change  as</span><span>  far  as  France  is  concerned.  Whether</span></p> <p><span>  the  Count  de  Paris  calls  himself  king  of</span><span>  France,  as  the  legitimate  heir  to  the</span><span>  Crown,  or  king  of  the  French  as  the</span><span>  representative  of  the  citizen  king,</span><span>  everything  in'  France  will  go  on  as</span><span>  before  ;  and  will  continue  to  do  so  until</span><span>  the  French  people  become  convinced</span><span>  that  the  Republic  is  a  failure.  When</span><span>  this  will  occur,  or  whether  it  will  ever</span><span>  occur,  is  a  problem  which  time  alone</span></p> <p><span>  will  snlvi».</span></p> <p><span>  AT  the  Police  Court  yesterday,  before  the</span><span>  Police  Magistrate,  one  drunkard  was  cautioned</span><span>  and  discharged.

Mr,  Griffith  will  shortly  bc</span><span>  thc  most  powerful  man  in  the  colony,</span><span>  and  most  politicians,  both  local  and</span><span>  general,  are  prone  to  worship  the  rising</span><span>  sun.  Gratitude  has  been  cynically  de</span><span>  I  fined  as  a  lively  appreciation  of  favours</span></p> <p><span>  to  come  rather  than  of  favours  conferred,</span><span>  and  it  is  not  unnatural,  perhaps,  that  the</span><span>  I  winners  of  an  election  should  attempt</span></p> <p><span>  to  grasp  so  much  of  the  victors'  spoils  as</span><span>  might  be  gathered  from  personal  and</span><span>  '  individual  recognition  by  ""the  finest</span></p> <p><span>  man  ever  produced  in  the  Australian</span><span>  Colonies,""  although  this  may  be  Mr.</span><span>  Garrick's  euphemistic  method  of  describ-</span><span>  ing  a  colonist  born  of  parents  at  the</span><span>  moment  ltvinginthe  landof  Taffy,and  still</span><span>  entitled  to  alt  the  rights  and  privileges  ol</span><span>  a  Welshman.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  OCTOIHÏR  4,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THERE  are  three  requirements  in  con-</span><span>  nection  willi  our  national  system  of</span><span>  education,  which  the  Government  ought</span><span>  to  aim  at  realising  in  the  public  interests,</span><span>  and  in  order  that  it  may  accomplish  the</span><span>  work  to  be  done.  These  are  that  it</span><span>  should  bc  available  lo  all  classes,  that  it</span><span>  should  be  cheap,  and  that  it  should  be</span><span>  efficient.  From  the  remarks  made  by</span><span>  us  on  this  subject  last  week  we  think  it</span><span>  will  be  conceded  that  wc  have  plenty  of</span><span>  ?schools.  Wherever  a  score  of  children</span><span>  can  be  gathered  together  there  the  Stale</span><span>  sends  a  teacher,  so  that  the  little,  ones</span><span>  may  not  be  utterly  neglected.  At  the</span><span>  end  of  last  year  lhere  were  361  schools</span><span>  in  operation,  and  929  teachers  on  the</span><span>  roll  of  this  branch  of  the  Civil  Service.</span><span>  If  the  children  are  not  educated  the</span><span>  fault  lies  in  the  main  with  the  parenis,</span><span>  who  neglected  their  duly  in  not  sending</span><span>  .them  to  school.  Some  blame  may  rest</span><span>  ion  the  authorities  for  not  enforcing  the</span><span>  compulsory  clauses  of  the  Act  in  our</span><span>  towns.  In  one  sense  education  in</span><span>  Queensland  is  cheap.  Indeed,  those</span><span>  whom  we  may  call  thc  consumers  could</span><span>  not  expect  to  get  it  at  a  cheaper  rate.</span><span>  All  our  nalion.il  school  doors  stand</span><span>  open,  inviting  the  attendance  of  the</span><span>  coming  race.  Except  the  cost  of  a  lew</span><span>  books  education  is  fae  to  those  imme-</span><span>  diately  interested.  Hut  though  not  paid  for</span><span>  directly,  thc  cost  of  it  bas  to  be  met  in</span><span>  another  w.iy  I'"",  very  minne  often,  every</span><span>  c.ike  of  tubarco,  every  n'ass  of  spirits</span><span>  necessities  .ind  limn  ¡es  ave  taxed  lo  a</span><span>  certnin  extent  lo  j.roviJe  funds  to  carry</span><span>  out  our  education.'.',  sy-.lem.  Our  ni  ist</span><span>  numerous  consumers  ol  commodities</span><span>  are  our  largest  taxpayers,  and  as  they</span><span>  belong  to  thc  working  class  they  are</span><span>  really  thc  best  supporters  of  the  system.</span><span>  They  pay  for  the  cduraiion  which  their</span><span>  rhildren  apparently  receive  gratuitously.</span><span>  They  have  a  good  right  to  know,  there</span></p> <p><span>  ii-.;  v.¡icítiL-r  thc  cost  of  teaching  is  not</span><span>  :.Miiiv.i!;aiUly  h'gh.  We  lum  in  vain</span><span>  )-.er  the  leave*  of  the  Anmnl  Report</span><span>  if  the  Seneiny  fir  l'uhlic  Insiruc</span><span>  ti  in,  in  search  of  satisfactory  informa</span><span>  li  m  on  this  point.  We  learn  thai</span><span>  the  gross  exendilure  on  Primary  Kducj</span></p> <p><span>  ti  in  in  Slate  and  Piovision.il  Schools</span></p> <p><span>  during  the  year  amounted  to  ,£112,060.</span></p> <p><span>  That  is  a  large  sum  equal  to  a  tax  of</span><span>  nearly  los.  a  head  of  the  whole  popula</span><span>  lion.  Instead  of  education  being  free,</span><span>  it  is  costing  each  of  us  a  considerable</span><span>  sum.  Details  are  given  of  the  cost  per</span><span>  head  of  children  enrolled,  and  in  average</span><span>  daily  attendance,  during  the  seven  years</span><span>  ending  the  21st  December  last,  from</span><span>  which  ive  see  that  it  has  fluctuated,  but</span><span>  at  the  end  of  the  period  it  is  larger  than</span><span>  at  the  beginning.  This  doubtless  is</span><span>  due  to  the  ample  provision  that  has</span><span>  been  made  by  the  erection  of</span><span>  school  buildings,  and  constitution  of  an</span></p> <p><span>  efficient  staff  of  teachers.  We  are  in-</span><span>  formed,  however,  the  average  cost  per</span><span>  pupil  throughout  the  colony  during  the</span><span>  year,  based  on  the  average  daily  atten-</span><span>  dance,  exclusive  of  the  items  for  scholar-</span><span>  ships,  Grammar  Schools,  and  Orphanages</span><span>  w;ls  t2S-  °j£d.  ""  Taking  the</span><span>  average  attendance  of  pupils  at  21,610,</span><span>  and  the  gross  expenditure  on  primary</span><span>  education  at  ¿¿112,060,  the  average  cost</span><span>  per  pupil  is  found  to  be  ¿Q$  3s.  8d.  It</span><span>  is  undcrsood  that  the  annual  average</span><span>  cost  per  pupil  in  other  Australian</span><span>  colonies  is  calculated  on  a  basis</span><span>  similar  to  this,  and  thc  sum  named</span><span>  should,  therefore,  be  taken  when</span><span>  comparing  the  annual  cost  per  pupil  in</span><span>  Queensland,  with  the  annual  cost  per</span><span>  pupil  in  the  other  colonies.""  It  is,</span><span>  perhaps,  no  part  of  the  duty  of  the  Hon.</span><span>  Mr.  Archer  to  tell  us  the  average  cost</span><span>  per  pupil  in  the  other  colonies,  but  had  he</span><span>  done  so  it  would  have  added  greatly  to</span><span>  thc  interest  and  value  of  his  report.  For</span><span>  such  information  we  must  resort  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  Education  Reports  of  these  colonies,</span><span>  which  are  not  so  easily  available  to  the</span><span>  community  as  they  are  lo  him.  Un-</span><span>  fortunately  for  the  discussion  of  this</span></p> <p><span>  point,  we  only  know  what  the  cost</span></p> <p><span>  is  in  Victoria.  There  it  is  set  down</span></p> <p><span>  at  £4  ts.  7d.,  or  £1  2s.  1  J¿d.  less  than</span><span>  in  Queensland.  Why  this  difference</span><span>  exists  ought  to  be  explained.  In  the</span><span>  older  colonies  the  school  buildings  have</span><span>  been  completed,  and.  the  salaries  of</span><span>  teachers  are  not  so  large  ;  nevertheless,</span><span>  upwards  of  one  pound  sterling  a  head  of</span><span>  difference  forms  a  large  aggregate  sum.</span></p> <p><span>  Thal  the  education  communicated  in</span><span>  our  schools  is  efficient  does  not  appear</span><span>  prominently.  Evidence  on  the  point  is</span><span>  wanting.  The  Chief  Inspector  says  the</span><span>  reports  of  the  Inspectors  show  that  the</span><span>  schools  are  in  a  fairly  satisfactory  slate</span><span>  as  to  discipline  and  proficiency.  Now,</span><span>  with  all  deference  to  Mr.  Ewart,  we</span><span>  submit  the  public  ought  to  have  distinct</span><span>  evidence  011  this  matter.  We  have</span><span>  repeatedly  pointed  out  that  the  number</span><span>  of  children  presented  for  examination,</span><span>  the  number  which  pass,  and  the  per-</span><span>  centage  of  marks  they  make,  should  be</span><span>  given  in  connection  with  every  school.</span><span>  On  these  points  thereports  of  Mr.  Platt  and</span><span>  Mr.  Shirley  alone  contain  information.</span><span>  The  former  gentleman  gives  a  series  of</span><span>  of  tables,  showing  the  results  of  the</span><span>  examinations  in  all  subjects  taught  in  the</span><span>  primary  schools.  In  none  is  the  value</span><span>  higher  than  75  per  ccnl;  but  we</span><span>  advance  in  efficiency  has  been  made.</span><span>  Such  details  as  Mr.  Platt  gives  in  table</span><span>  C  of  his  report  ought  to  be  furnished</span><span>  regarding  every  school  in  the  colony.</span><span>  Mr.  Shirley's  Examination  Results  are</span><span>  useful  as  far  as  they  go,  but  are  not</span><span>  sufficiently  complete.  Proof  is  wanting,</span><span>  therefore,  that  the  education  given  is  up</span></p> <p><span>  to  the  standard  of  other  colonies  and  of</span><span>  European  countries.  Without  the</span><span>  returns  which  we  desiderate  our  educa</span><span>  lion  Report  will  continue  to  be  incom-</span><span>  plete  and  unsatisfactory.</span></p> ",Article,1883-10-04,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  KOCKIIAMl'TON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  JANUARY  23,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Opposition  Press  are  indulging  in</span><span>  peans  over  the  safe  return  and  marvellous</span><span>  squatting  conquests  of  the  adventurous</span><span>  brace  of  politicians  who  have  just  com-</span><span>  pleted  a  flying  trip  from  Townsville  to</span><span>  Charters  Towers,  Hughenden,  Winton,</span><span>  Muttaburra,  Aramac,  Blackall,  Charle-</span><span>  ville,  and  Roma,  to  Brisbane.  They</span><span>  have  discovered,  among  other  wonderful</span><span>  things,  that  every  able-bodied  man  in  the</span><span>  western  country  is  appalled  at  the</span><span>  astounding  wickedness  of  the  Trans-</span><span>  continental  project.  There  was,  in  fact,</span><span>  no  one  outside  Brisbane  capable  of  say-</span><span>  ing  a  good  word  for  it.  The  squatters</span><span>  naturally  drêaded  the  cutting  up  of  their</span><span>  runs,  and  the  working  classes  feared  that</span><span>  the  railway,  instead  of  being  carried  out</span><span>  by  the  Government  whose  pay  was  sure,</span><span>  would  be  undertaken  and  worked  entirely</span><span>  by  ""  foreigners  ""  and  imported  labour.</span><span>  The  Syndicate,  in  fact,  including  French</span><span>  bankers  as  well  as  English  aristocrats,</span><span>  had  no  interest  in  the  country,  and</span><span>  wanted  simply  to  plunder  it.  They</span><span>  would  not  only  bring  in  foreign  labour,</span><span>  but  would  exercise  such  unbounded  in-</span><span>  fluence  over  the  Government,  and  Parlia-</span><span>  ment  for  the  time  being,  that  they  would,</span><span>  despite  the  wishes  of  the  constituencies,</span><span>  fill  the  country  with  coolies  and  Chinamen,</span><span>  andcompletely  drive  out  the  present  white</span><span>  inhabitants,  The  colony  would  then  be</span></p> <p><span>  inhabited  by  three  classes-proud  off-  j</span><span>  shoots  of  the  British  aristocracy,  a  few</span><span>  greedy  French  bankers,  and  some  millions</span><span>  of  ""  voteless  serfs.""  Mauritius  or  Jamaica</span><span>  would  then  be  respectable  by  comparison</span><span>  with  the  degraded  although  now  rich</span><span>  colony  of  Queensland.  This  is  the</span><span>  kind  of  talk  in  which  the  Canny  Men</span><span>  have  indulged  out  west,  in  the  hope  of</span><span>  thus  securing  the  allegiance  both  of  the</span><span>  squatters  and  their  men.  If  Messrs.</span><span>  Grilfith  and  Dickson  get  into  power,  not</span><span>  only  will  there  be  no  Transcontinental</span><span>  Railway,  but  the  western  squatters  will</span><span>  have  indefeasible  leases,  and  voteless</span><span>  serfs  will  be  kept  forcibly  out  of  the</span><span>  colony.  With  such  inducements  as</span><span>  these  held  out,  it  is  not  surprising  that  the</span><span>  people  of  Western  Queensland  have  dis-</span><span>  covered  the  good  policy  of  transferring</span><span>  their  loyalty  to  the  rising  sun.</span></p> <p><span>  The  returned  travellers  appear  to  have</span><span>  acquired  an  exhaustless  stock  of  informa-</span><span>  tion  during  their  rapid  trip.  Indeed,  it</span><span>  will  be  quite  useless  in  future  for  the</span><span>  squatting  members  to  attempt  to  instruct</span><span>  the  leading  Liberals  upon  northern  and</span><span>  western  local  peculiarities.  Messrs.  Griffith</span><span>  and  Dickson  have  spent  a  whole  month</span><span>  in  exploring  the  Never-never  country,</span><span>  and  they  are  chock-full  of  the  latest</span><span>  information  respecting  its  physical  and</span><span>  climatic  characteristics,  as  well  as  the</span><span>  """".,u,  Idiosyncrasies,  ana  wishes'  or  tts</span><span>  inhabitants.  By  the  date  when  Parlia-</span><span>  ment  meetr,  they  will  have  had  ample</span><span>  time  to  digest  and  assimilate  the  mass  of</span><span>  knowledge,  which  has  been  crammed</span><span>  into  them  by  Cobb's  coach-drivers,  while</span><span>  on  the  road,  and  by  hospitable  innkeepers</span><span>  or  squatters,  at  their  nightly  camps.</span><span>  They  will,  indeed,  be  perfect  cyclopedias</span><span>  of  information  on  western  topics,  and</span><span>  will  be  quite  competent  soon  to  under-</span><span>  take  the  piloting  of  the  ship  of  State.</span><span>  No  more  shall  they  be  reproached  with</span><span>  ignorance  of  aught  save  Queen-street</span><span>  politics,  and  not  again  shall  Sir  Thomas</span><span>  M'llwraith  expose  the  shallowness  of</span><span>  their  geographical  criticism.  And  their</span><span>  party  will  gain  a  still  greater  advantage</span><span>  in  having  established  centres,  from  which</span><span>  the  battle  shall  be  waged  with  the</span><span>  M'llwraith  Government,  in  the  very</span><span>  middle  of  their  entrenched  camps.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  humilating  failure  of  the  Victorian</span><span>  four  million  loan  has  had  an  important</span><span>  effect  upon  the  .colonial  money  market.</span><span>  Almost  suddenly  it  is  discovered  that</span><span>  capital  is  scarce,  that  the  bank  screw</span><span>  must  be  put  on,  and  that  no  advance</span><span>  must  be  made  to  any  person  for  the  pur-</span><span>  pose  of  assisting  him  in  the  acquisition</span><span>  of  land.  It  is  said  that  some  of  the</span><span>  Brisbane  banks  are  giving  as  much  as</span><span>  six  and  a-half  per  cent  for  deposits,</span><span>  although  six  is  still  the  current  rate  for</span><span>  twelve  months'  fixtures.  The  mortgage</span><span>  rate  too  has  considerably  advanced.  A</span><span>  few  months  ago  money  could  be  easily</span><span>  got  on  first-class  eily  properties  at  even</span><span>  less  than  six  per  cent  ;  now  nothing  less</span><span>  than  nine  per  cent  is  mentioned,  and  an</span><span>  enlarged  margin  is  demanded.  The  man</span><span>  who  tries  to  borrow  on  unimproved</span><span>  5ulnirban  properly,  even  in  Sydney  and</span><span>  Melbourne,  is  laughed  at  for  his  pains.</span><span>  Certificates  of  title  to  such  properties  are</span><span>  forlhe  time  being  valueless,  and  thc  worst</span><span>  of  the  case  is  that  thousands  of  persons,</span><span>  who  a  short  time  since  bought  allotments</span><span>  at  fabulous  prices  under  the  exhilarating</span><span>  influence  of  champagne,  now  find  that</span><span>  the  payments  already  made  represent</span><span>  far  more  than  the  intrinsic  value  of  their</span><span>  purchases,  while  their  six,  nine,  twelve,</span><span>  and  eighteen  months  promissory  notes</span><span>  for  the  balances,  are  still  maturing.</span><span>  This  is  a  very  uncomfortable  condition</span><span>  of  affairs  for  many  thrifty  persons  who</span><span>  invested  hard  savings,  and  pledged  their</span><span>  prospective  earnings  for  almost  valueless</span><span>  land  ;  but  they  have  no  one  to  blame</span><span>  but  themselves.  The  man  who  lives</span><span>  upon  his  salary,  or  whose  business</span><span>  capital  is  limited,  is  not  justified  in</span><span>  buying  land  purely  for  speculative  pur-</span><span>  poses.  The  man  who  has  a  hundred</span><span>  pounds  in  thc  Savings  Bank,  and  prefers</span><span>  investing  it  in  allotments,  is  free  to  do</span><span>  so.  He  may  lose  by  thc  speculation,</span><span>  bul  can  afford  it.  But  he  who  renews</span><span>  his  paper  to  raise  the  wind,  indulges  in</span><span>  the  fiscal  operation  known  as  ""  kite-</span><span>  flying,""  or  pays  to  the  auctioneer  money</span><span>  due  lo  his  storekeeper,  commits  an</span><span>  immoral  act,  which  will  almost  certainly</span><span>  lead  him  into  trouble.  These  practices</span><span>  are,  in  fact,  speculations  with  other</span><span>  people's  rooney,  and  that  usually  without</span></p> <p><span>  their  consent  The  effect  is  to  create</span><span>  fictitious  competition,  illegitimately  swell</span><span>  current  values,  and  inflict  loss  upon</span><span>  bona  fide  masters  and  dealers.  The</span><span>  land  mania  which  has  just  been  rudely</span><span>  suppressed  by  a  tight  money  market,  will</span><span>  leave  its  bad  effects  upon  the  com-</span><span>  munity,  long  after  the  event  has  been</span></p> <p><span>  forgotten  by  the  general  public.  .  Money  1</span><span>  so  sunk  is  capital  diverted  from  legitimate</span><span>  business  and  industries  and  to  a.  great  ex-</span><span>  tent  destroyed.  It  is  well  that  the  banks</span><span>  have  at  length  tightened  the  purse</span><span>  strings,  and  dispelled  the  halo  of  ex-</span><span>  aggerated  values,  which,  for  the  time</span><span>  being,  had  invested  landed  property  of</span><span>  every  discription.  But  are,  the  banks</span><span>  entirely  without  fault  in  this  case  ?  They</span><span>  must,  or  ought  lo  have  known,  that  their</span><span>  rapidly  swelling  advances  were  not  legti</span><span>  mate.  In  Queensland  alone  during  last</span><span>  year  the  debts  of  the  public  to  the  banks</span><span>  increased  by  close  upon  two  millions</span><span>  sterling,  or  in  the  astounding  ratio,  of</span><span>  nearly  forty  per  cent.  The  banks  ought:</span><span>  to  have  known  that  the  increase  of</span><span>  population,  trade,  or  wealth  by  no  means</span><span>  justilied  this  inflation,  and  they  must  be</span><span>  held  largely  responsible  for  the  bad  con-</span><span>  sequences  that  ensue.  The  moment  a</span><span>  bank  assists  its  customer  to  enter  into</span><span>  land  buying  for  purely  speculative  pur-</span><span>  poses,  that  moment  it  creates  a  fresh</span><span>  competitor  and  unduly  inflates  market</span><span>  prices.  And  when  a  bank  assists</span><span>  one  of  its  customers  to  speculatively</span><span>  compete  against  another,  or  against  the</span><span>  customer  of  a  rival  bank,  then  it  does</span><span>  such  customer  mischief,  which  is  often</span><span>  irremediable.  We  shall  be  to'.d  that  our</span></p> <p><span>  reflections  now  are  equivalent  to  locking</span></p> <p><span>  the  stable  door  after  the  steed  has  been</span></p> <p><span>  stolen.  Perhaps  so,  but  it  is  impossible</span><span>  for  persons  outside  financial  circles  to</span><span>  judge  when  speculation  is  legitimate,  and</span><span>  when  it  has  become  an  incipient  mania.</span><span>  It  is  in  the  bank  parlour  alone  that  the</span><span>  knowledge  is  available  which  would</span><span>  enable  reckless  speculation  to  be  kept</span><span>  in  salutary  check.</span></p> <p><span>  IT  would  seem  according  -to  our  telegrams</span><span>  received  last  Saturday,  that  there  is  auother</span><span>  giganticTranscontincntalrailway  scheme  under</span><span>  consideration  besides  our  own.  Mr.  Anthony</span><span>  Hordern,  of  Sydney,  N.S.W.,  representing  a</span><span>  Syndicate  of  London  capitalists,  has  offered</span><span>  to  construct  a  railway  from  Albany  iu  Western</span><span>  Australia,  to  Cambridge  Gulf  on  the  north-</span><span>  western  coast  of  Australia,  on  tho  land-grant</span><span>  system.  Presuming  this  to  be  a  genuine</span><span>  offer,  we  here  have  evidence  of  capital</span><span>  being  available  for  the  purpose  of  de-</span><span>  veloping  the  resources  of  Australia,  but  it</span><span>  is  worthy  of  our  careful  considera-</span><span>  tion,  that  this  capital  may  become  speedily</span><span>  absorbed.  Should,  say,  £10,000,000  stalling</span><span>  be  speculated  in  Western  Australia,  it  is  not</span><span>  unlikely  there  may  be  some  difficulty  in</span><span>  getting  the  capital  required  for  our  Transcon-</span><span>  tinental  line  on  anything  like  reasonable</span><span>  terms.  The  line  proposed  for  Western  Aus-</span><span>  tralia  would  extend  over  about  2000  miles  of</span><span>  country,  and  in  the  construction  of  it  some</span><span>  £10,000,001)  is  proposed  to  be  spent.  It  may</span><span>  be  that  in  the  Syndicate  now  offering  to</span><span>  Western  Australia,  will  be  some  whose  capital</span><span>  would  be  valuable  to  us,  and  it  may  turn</span><span>  out  that  after  Queensland  has  been  the  first</span><span>  colony  to  moot  the  principle,  it  will  be  thc</span><span>  last  to  derive  benefit  therefrom.  It  may  be</span><span>  that  while  we  are  wasting  our  energy  on  party</span><span>  politics  others  will  outstrip  ns  in  the  London</span><span>  money  market.  There  is  one  feature  about</span><span>  this  now  Syndicate's  proposal  especially</span><span>  worthy  of  notice,  and  that  is-besides  the</span><span>  land  given  by  the  Government  to  the  capi-</span><span>  talists,  each  immigrant  they  bring  out  will</span><span>  receive  1G0  acres  of  land.  Now,  as  one  of</span><span>  the  chief  arguments  in  favour  of  tho  land</span><span>  grant  railways  IB  that  they  will  cause  the</span><span>  country  to  become  settled,  it  would  be</span><span>  perhaps  a  good  thing  to  introduce  this  system</span><span>  of  land-orders  into  our  contract.  If  it  were</span><span>  done,  one  great  grievance  of  tho  anti-monopo</span><span>  lists  would  vanish.</span></p> <p><span>  BEFORE  the  Police  Magistrate  yesterday</span><span>  morning  Frederick  Garvey  pleaded  guilty  to</span><span>  oharges  of  drunkenness  and  making  usc  of</span><span>  obsceno  language.

The</span><span>  first  two  were  holders  of  scholarships  from  the</span><span>  Central  Rockhampton  and  Central  Brisbane</span><span>  Strate  schools  respectively.</span></p> <p><span>  IT  is  understood  (says  the  Courier)  that  the</span><span>  omnibus  proprietors  have  obtained  tho  ear  of</span><span>  one  or  more  of  the  aldermen,  and  that  strong</span><span>  efforts  aro  to  be  made  to  prevent  the  construc-</span><span>  tion  of  the  proposed  tramway,  cither  by  thc</span><span>  council  or-by  a  joint-stock  company.  It  is</span><span>  alleged  that  under  the  provisions  of  the  Local</span><span>  Government  Act  a  special  rate  must  be  levied</span><span>  as  soon  as  the  loan  is  advanced,  aud  that  one</span><span>  third  of  the  ratepayers  will  have  power  to</span><span>  forbid  the  loan.  But  this  is  a  mistake.  The</span><span>  proposed  tramway  loan  will  not  bo  a  loan</span><span>  within  the  meaning  of  the  22Gth  section  of  the</span><span>  Local  Government  Act.  By  section  88  of  thc</span><span>  Tramways  Act,  the  advance  would  bo  made</span><span>  under  the  Local  Works  Loan  Act,  ""  notwith-</span><span>  standing  any  restriction  or  limitation  impose/!  hy</span><span>  any  otlier  Act.""  Hcnco,  if  the  Governor-in</span><span>  Council  and  Corporation  agreed  that  the  tram-</span><span>  way  should  be  undertaken,  thero  would  be  no</span><span>  difficulty  in  thc  way.  It  would  be  absurd  to</span><span>  allow  one-third  of  tho  ratepayers  in  the</span><span>  municipality  to  practically  Bay  that  a  tramway</span><span>  should  not  be  constructed  in  Woolloongabba</span></p> <p><span>  or  Booroodabin.</span></p> <p><span>  MANY  complaints  have  reached  us  lately</span><span>  from  merchants  and  others  of  thc  inconvenience</span><span>  caused  by  carriers  delaying  to  deliver  loadiug.</span><span>  From  an  exchange  we  find  that  two  cases  have</span><span>  lately  been  decided  at  the  Blackall  Police</span><span>  Court  against  carriers  for  thus  *'  wilfully</span><span>  delaying  to  deliver  loading.""  Io  ono  case  where</span><span>  goods  had  been  sent  by  Mr.  Curtis,  of  Rock-</span><span>  hampton,  toa  client,  Mr.  Ahnfcldt,  in  Blackall,</span><span>  the  way  bill  bore  date  of  June  2,  1882,  and</span><span>  delivery  did  not  take  place  till  thc  September</span><span>  following.  The  defence  set  up  was  that  the</span><span>  carrier  had  been  delayed  by  bad  weather  at</span><span>  Springsure  where  he  waB  compelled  to  remain</span><span>  for  four  weeks.  The  Bench  Hued  the  defen-</span><span>  dant  £40,  in  default  levy  and  distress  ;  if  not</span><span>  sufficient  warrant,  one  month's  imprisonment</span><span>  in  Blackall  gaol.  In  another  case  n  storekeeper</span><span>  proved  loss  to  thc  amount  of  £100  through  n</span><span>  a  carrier's  delay,  and  a  fine  of  £45  compensation</span><span>  and  £4  ls.  2d.  coBts  was  imposed  with  thc</span><span>  same  alternative  as  in  the  previous  case.  From</span><span>  this  it  will  ho  seen  that  njerchants  and  store-</span><span>  keepers  are  not  completely  in  the  hands  of  the</span><span>  carriers,  and  thc  very  heavy  fines  inflicted  on</span><span>  thc  two  examples  made  at  Blackall,  should</span><span>  have  a  beneficial  effect  in  causing  a  little  more</span><span>  care  to  be  taken  by  a  very  independent  class.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  have  been  favoured  by  Mr.  B.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMP'TON.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY.  FEBRUARY  2,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  POLITICIANS  who  have  been  watching</span><span>  the  course  ot  events  ia  Victoria  will  not</span><span>  be  surprised  at  the  announcement  that</span><span>  the  Ministry  there  have  resigned.  To</span><span>  many  the  wonder  will  be,  not  that  they</span><span>  have  resigned  now,  but  that  they  have</span><span>  continued  to  cling  to  office  so  long.</span><span>  Only  a  very  strong  sense  of  utter  inca-</span><span>  pacity  and  inutility  could  have  led  them</span><span>  to  ky  down  the  reins  of  office,  and  issue</span><span>  such  an  address  as  that  of  which  we  have</span></p> <p><span>  '  received  a  summary  by  telegraph.  With</span></p> <p><span>  I  apparent  coolness  and  complacency  the</span><span>  I  Ministry  declare  their  own  incom-</span></p> <p><span>  petency.  They  have  asked  for  a  disso-</span><span>  lution  of  Parliament,  on  the  ground  that</span><span>  it  has  done  nothing  in  the  way  of  useful</span><span>  legislation  for  the  last  eight  months,  and</span><span>  there  was  no  prospect  of  an  improvement</span><span>  during  the  remainder  of  the  term.  In</span><span>  any  other  body  such  action,  upon  the</span><span>  grounds  professed,  would  be  looked  upon</span><span>  as  senseless  and  ridiculous,  bul  in  that</span><span>  of  the  Ministry  of  a  large  and  wealthy</span><span>  colony  it  appears  to  deserve  to  be  charac-</span><span>  terised  as  highly  culpable.  Their  conduct</span><span>  is  condemnable  not  in  that  they  have</span><span>  resigned  now,  but  that  they  did  not  con-</span><span>  sult  the  country  long  ago-  At  the  outset</span><span>  the  Ministry  was  of  an  experimental</span><span>  character.  It  possessed  a  coalition  con-</span><span>  stitution,  and  its-  longevity  could  not  be</span><span>  looked  for.  In  the  face  of  continuous</span></p> <p><span>  and  varied  opposition,  Sir  B.  O'Loghlen</span><span>  and  his  friends  have  retained  their  posi-</span><span>  tion  at  the  head  of  affairs.  Long  ago</span><span>  they  must  have  become  convinced  of</span><span>  the  fact  that  their  tenure  of  power  was</span><span>  retained  on  sufferance.  We  will  not  do</span></p> <p><span>  them  .  the  indignity  of  supposing  they</span></p> <p><span>  were  not  conscious  of  their  weakness</span></p> <p><span>  and  helplessness.  The  discovery  they</span><span>  profess  to  have  made  only  recently  was</span><span>  apparent  to  others  long  ago.  They</span><span>  declare  that  they  have  been  unable  to</span><span>  cope  with  the  opposition  to  which  they</span><span>  have  been  exposed  during  the  last  eight</span><span>  months.  Such  opposition  was  to  be</span><span>  anticipated,  as  it  was  well  enough  known</span><span>  that  the  Premier  did  not  possess  the  con-</span></p> <p><span>  fidence  of  the  members  on  either  side  of  1</span><span>  the  House.  Repeatedly,  in  the  course</span><span>  of  business,  he  has  had  this  fact  im-</span><span>  pressed  on  his  observation,  but  he</span><span>  proceeded,  regardless  of  it,  till  he  could</span><span>  go  on  no  longer.  The  force  of  public</span><span>  opinion  had  become  too  strong  for  even</span><span>  Sir  Bryan  O'Loghlen  to  withstand  its</span><span>  influence.  For  a  time  the  Ministry  were</span><span>  tolerated,  but  latterly  they  have  been</span><span>  assailed  by  all  sections  of  the  press.</span><span>  Their  conduct  of  public  affairs,  having</span><span>  merited,  has  met  with  general  condem-</span><span>  nation.  Instead  of  waiting  lill  com-</span><span>  pelled  to  retire  amid  the  condemnatory</span><span>  diatribes  of  journalists,  they  ought  to</span><span>  have  tried  to  preserve  some  little  dignity</span><span>  by  resigning  or  appealing  to  the  country</span><span>  months  ago.  In  that  event  they  might</span><span>  have  enjoyed  the  respect  of  a  section  of</span><span>  the  electors,  but  the  result  of  the  elec-</span><span>  tions,  we  fear,  will  show  they  have</span><span>  neither  the  confidence  of  the  Assembly,</span></p> <p><span>  nor  of  the  constituencies.</span></p> <p><span>  Those  who  are  opposed  to  the  practice</span><span>  of  paying  members  for  their  Parlia-</span><span>  mentary  services,  will  probably  point  to</span><span>  the  present  political  crisis  in  Victoria  as</span><span>  due  to  that  cause  ;  and  there  can  be</span><span>  little  doubt,  we  think,  that  had  the  sweets</span><span>  of  office  not  been  luscious,  and  the</span><span>  emoluments  of  membership  acceptable,</span><span>  the  constituencies  would  have  been</span><span>  consulted  some  time  ago.  Neither  the</span><span>  Conservative  nor  Radical  party  was</span><span>  prepared  to  take  office.  The  laaders  of</span><span>  each  waited,  watching  the  current  of</span></p> <p><span>  events,  and  in  no  haste  to  bring  matters</span><span>  to  a  crisis  for  fear  of  offending  the  rank</span><span>  and  file,  who  were  doing  little,  and</span><span>  drawing  their  salaries.  The  arrangement</span><span>  was  too  good  to  last,  and  now  it  has</span><span>  been  been  brought  to  a  most  humilating</span><span>  conclusion.  The  Ministry  are  mostly  to</span><span>  be  blamed  for  it,  but  the  members  of</span><span>  Assembly  are  equally  culpable.  For  the</span><span>  administration  recently  in  office  thebulkof</span><span>  them  had  little  sympathy.  They  tolerated</span><span>  and  kept  the  Government  alive.  Weak</span><span>  though  it  was  they  gave  it  the  amount  of</span><span>  vitality  necessary  for  its  existence.  At</span><span>  any  time  they  might  have  terminated  its</span><span>  career,  and  thal  they  have  allowed  the</span><span>  Ministry,  after  eight  months  of  com-</span><span>  parative  idleness,  to  commit  suicide,  is</span><span>  not  at  all  to  their  credit.  It  is  possible,</span><span>  indeed,  that,  by  the  condemnation  their</span><span>  conduct  is  certain  to  receive,  the</span><span>  Ministry  hope  to  profit.  We  shall  be</span><span>  disappointed,  however,  if  the  electors,  in</span><span>  their  condemnation  of  the  Parliamentary</span><span>  farce  that  has  been  going  on  for  the  last</span><span>  eight  months,  do  not  overwhelm  both</span><span>  ministers  and  members  with  confusion.</span></p> <p><span>  How  far  the  failure  of  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  to  float  the  recent  loan  has  had  an</span><span>  effect  in  precipitating  the  dissolution  it</span><span>  is  difficult  to  determine.  Many  will  be</span><span>  ready  to  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the</span><span>  want  of  rooney  has  led  to  the  change,</span><span>  and  the  reverse  is  not  clear.  At  the</span></p> <p><span>  beginning  of  last  month  the  colony  had</span><span>  at  its  credit  in  the  banks  upwards</span><span>  of  .£920,000.  In  anticipation  of</span><span>  the  floating  of  the  four  million  loan,</span><span>  the  associated  banks  had  placed</span><span>  ,£2,000,000  at  the  credit  of  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment.  The  consolidated  revenue,  it  was</span><span>  anticipated,  would  produce  ,£3,000,000</span><span>  at  June  next,  which,  with  the  balance  on</span><span>  hand  and  loan,  would  have  made  an</span><span>  aggregate  sum  of  ,£8,000,000,  The  ex-</span><span>  penditure  not  exceeding  ,£4,000,000</span><span>  would  have  lett  the  Government  with</span></p> <p><span>  £4,000,000  to  meet  interest,  liabilities,.</span><span>  &c.  As  the  loan  has  not  been  floated,</span><span>  the  bank  advance  will  add  to  the  burden</span><span>  of  debt;  arid  the  amount  available  for</span><span>  carrying  on  the  Government  &c,  will  be</span><span>  less  than  £6,000,000.  Then,  another</span><span>  loan  of  nearly  four  millions  will  require</span><span>  to  be  floatedat  the  close  of  this  year.  Thus</span></p> <p><span>  it  will  be  seen  that  the  financial  affairs  of</span><span>  the  colony  are  not  in  a  healthy  state,  and</span><span>  that  circumstance,  as  much  as  the</span><span>  hostility  of  members  in  Parliament,  has</span><span>  probably  led  the  Ministry  to  seek  a</span><span>  refuge  from  their  troubles  in  a  disso-</span></p> <p><span>  lution.</span></p> <p><span>  ON  inquiring  at  the  Police  Office  yesterday</span><span>  we  learned  that  Rebecca  Dobson,  the  young</span><span>  woman  who  was  missing  from  her  residence  in</span><span>  Alma-lane  tbeprevionsday,  had  returned  home,</span><span>  having  probably  altered  her  miud  as  to</span><span>  drowning  herself.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  second  anniversary  of  Court  Maid</span><span>  Marian  will  be  celebrated  by  a  banquet  in  the</span><span>  Foresters'  Hall,  North  Rockhampton,  thia</span><span>  evening.  The  opportunity  will  be  availed  of</span><span>  to  present  Mr.  F.  Linthwaite,  P.D.C.'Ranger,</span><span>  with  an  illuminated  address,  which  has  been</span><span>  tastefully  prepared  by  Mr.  J.  Coker.</span></p> <p><span>  ANOTHER  of  the  Mackay  Cingalese,  by  name</span><span>  Elias,  arrived  by  the  coast  mail  steamer,  and</span><span>  was  lodged  in  gaol  on  Wednesday.  He  is</span><span>  under  sentence  of  three  montbB  for  having</span><span>  etolen  property  in  his  possession.  The  Maokay</span><span>  Bench  is  apparently  determined  upon  forcing</span><span>  these  very  undesirable  characters  upon  Rock-</span><span>  hampton.</span></p> <p><span>  ON  Saturday  last  a  man  named  Francis</span><span>  Heffernan,  who  was  staying  in  the  Royal</span><span>  Hotel,  East-street,  missed  a  tent  and  fly,  and</span><span>  reported  the  loss  to  the  police.  Two  miles,</span><span>  named  Miles  Dempsey  and  Walter  M'Nicol,</span><span>  have  been  arrested  at  Emerald  for  the  theft,</span><span>  and  arrived  in  town  yesterday  evening  in</span></p> <p><span>  charge  of  Constable  Canning.  They  will  be</span><span>  brought  before  the  Police  Magistrate  this</span></p> <p><span>  morning.</span></p> <p><span>  A  GREAT  disturbance  occurred  at  the  Immi-</span><span>  gration  Depot  last  night,  owing  to  the  single</span><span>  women  raising  an  alarm  that  someone  was</span><span>  attempting  to  effect  an  entrance  into  their</span><span>  quarters.  The  screams  for  a  time  was  deafen-</span><span>  ing,  and  for  over  half  an  hour  it  was  im-</span><span>  possible  to  pacify  the  girls.  On  examination</span><span>  no  evidenoes  of  an  attempt  to  break  into  the</span><span>  compartment  were  discovered.  MoBt  of  the</span><span>  immigrants  were  more  or  less  under  the</span><span>  influence  of  liquor.  Up  to  a  late  hour  last</span><span>  night  several  of  the  girls  continued  hysterical.</span><span>  Several  police  were  speedily  on  the  soene,  and</span><span>  did  all  that  was  possible  to  maintain  order.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Mastodon  Minstrels  repeated  their</span><span>  second  programme  last  evening  to  a  fair  house.</span><span>  The  various  items  were  received  by  the</span><span>  audience  with  signs  of  approval,  and  consider-</span><span>  able  merriment  was  produced  by  the  laughable</span><span>  sketches.  The  band  of  the  Company,  which</span><span>  Slays  outside  previous  to  the  performance,</span></p> <p><span>  eserves  a  word  of  praise  for  the  able</span><span>  manner  in  which  it  renders  excellent  selec-</span><span>  tions.  To-night  an  entire  change  of  pro-</span><span>  gramme  is  announced,  when  the  screaming</span><span>  burlesque  on  the  favourite  operetta  ""Pina-</span><span>  fore""  will  be  performed  under  the  title  cf</span><span>  Pin-A-i.  This  piece  is,  we  believe,  the  best</span><span>  performed  by  the  troupe,  and  is  spoken  of  by</span><span>  the  Bouthern  papers  as  excessively  amusing.</span><span>  Doubtless  there  will  be  a  good  house  to  wit-</span><span>  ness  it.</span></p> <p><span>  JAMES  KEOGH,  on  remand,  was  brought  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  before  the  Police  Magistrate  yesterday  morn-</span><span>  ing,  charged  by  the  Police  with  drunkenness</span><span>  and  disorderly  conduct,  using  profane</span><span>  language,  and  resisting  Constable  Livingstone,</span><span>  who  arrested  him.  There  was  a  further  charge</span><span>  preferred  by  Mr.  Francis  H.  Nixon  for  having</span><span>  wilfully  destroyed  certain  property  in  the</span><span>  complainant's  premises  in  Quay-street.  To  all</span><span>  these  charges  the  defendant  pleaded  guilty</span><span>  and  would  have  been  dealt  with  at  once,  but</span><span>  the  complainant  asked  for  a  remand  to  permit</span><span>  of  his  solicitor,  Mr.  Melbourne,  attending.</span><span>  The  Police  Magistrate  could  not  see  the  utility</span><span>  of  such  a  proceeding,  as  he  was  aware  of  the</span><span>  circumstances  connected  with  the  charges  to</span><span>  which  defendant  had  pleaded  guilty.  Mr.</span><span>  Nixon,  however,  strongly  pleaded  for  an  ad-</span><span>  journment  till  Saturday,  which  was  granted.</span><span>  A  vagrant  named  Elizabeth  Helaion  was  sent</span><span>  to  gaol  for  seven  days.</span></p> <p><span>  The  remainder  of  the  immigrants  per  the</span><span>  Melpomene  arrived  by  the  steamer  Fitzroy</span><span>  yesterday.

"<p><span>  ROCKÍIM'JPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  JULY  4.  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  OUR  readers  will  doubtless  have  noticed</span><span>  an  advertisement  appearing  ;  in  our</span><span>  columns,  to  which  is  appended  the</span><span>  signatures  ol  most  of  our  merchants</span><span>  and  importers,  and  offering  a  reward  for</span><span>  the  detection  of  those  who  'are  guilty  of</span><span>  pilfering  the  contents  of  packages  landed,</span><span>  here  Irom  import  vessels.'  We'are.  not</span></p> <p><span>  aware  that  this  inducement  has  had  the</span><span>  desired  effect  up  till  the.  present  time,</span></p> <p><span>  and  are  inclined  to  think  the  subject  is.</span><span>  of  sufficient  importance,  when  considered  :</span><span>  in  all  its  bearings,  to  engage  the  attention  .</span><span>  of  our  Chamber  of  Commerce.  À  dis-</span><span>  cussion  recently  took  place  at  a</span><span>  meeting  of  the  Sydney  merchants  on,</span><span>  a  subject,  which  it  seems  to  us</span><span>  has  a  close  relationship  to  the  evil,</span><span>  from  which  our  towsfolk  desire  to</span><span>  free  themselves.  The  meeting  in  the</span><span>  so'ufhcrh  metropolis  was  convened  to</span><span>  consider  the  terras  and  '  conditions</span><span>  inserted  in  Bills  of  lading,  which  are</span><span>  supposed  to  specify  the  nature.  of  the</span><span>  contract  between  the  ship.  and  shippen.</span><span>  Complaint  was  made,  and  we  think  not</span><span>  altogether  without  just  cause,'  of  '  ;the</span><span>  stringent  conditions  ihsis'ted.urjp'fi  by  some</span><span>  .  lines  of  steamers,  as  the  only  terms  iipon</span><span>  ;  w)>jph'  uiey""  will  ^contract  foi  flie'.çpri</span></p> <p><span>  veyance  of  goods  ;  and  instances  were</span><span>  cited/showmg  how  disadvantageous  was</span><span>  thejr  .operation  upon,  the  generally,</span><span>  understood  .  -rights  ,  and  {recourses  Of</span><span>  consignees.  1  An  impartial  examination</span><span>  of-  the  i  cases-  involving  claims  upon</span><span>  vessels,'employed  to'convèy  'merchan-</span><span>  dise  to  the  rnbie'  fretrüerited  SyuYhern</span><span>  potts,  would  doubtless  disclose  many</span><span>  instances  in  which  claims,  even  of</span><span>  a  debatable  nature,  had  been  recovered</span><span>  at  the  last  momeut  by  putting  into  force</span><span>  the  extreme.,  measure  of  arresting  the</span><span>  vessel  on  the  eve  of  her  departure  ;  but,</span><span>  on  the  other  hand,  many  just  demands</span><span>  for  redress  have  been  resisted  by  over</span><span>  zealous  shipmasteris  and  othert,  who</span><span>  have  perhaps  been  :  improperly  biassed</span><span>  by  the  assumption  that  the  defaulting</span><span>  vessel  would  not  again  come  inte</span></p> <p><span>  contact  with  the.  injured  parties'.</span><span>  Excesses  of  ibis'  kind,  Whether  com-</span><span>  mitted  by  ship  or  consignee,  cannot</span><span>  however  but  be  considered  as  unfortunate,</span><span>  and  tending  to  increase  the  tension</span><span>  already  and  unavoidably  existing  between</span><span>  ship  and  cargo.  The  old  style  of</span><span>  slow-going  but  money-making  sailing</span><span>  vessel  is  how  almost  extinct.  ,  The</span><span>  lading  and  discharge  of  such  craft  occu-</span><span>  pied  a  considerable  time,  and  was  con-</span><span>  ducted  in  a  leisurely  and  very  pains-</span><span>  taking,  if'  somewhat  costly,  fashion  ;  but</span><span>  there  can  be  little  doubt  goods  reached</span><span>  their  destination  then  without  such</span><span>  severe  traces  of  thc  exigencies  of  travel,</span><span>  as  they  frequently  betray  nowadays.</span><span>  Steam  and  speed  haye  revolutionised  this,</span><span>  as  well  as  most  other  things.  Competi-</span><span>  tion  lias  led  to  successive  reductions  is</span><span>  freights.  Steamers,are  how'coritent  with</span></p> <p><span>  rates  that  were  ¿a  lately  paid'  freely  to</span></p> <p><span>  sailing  vessels,  and  the  only  way  in</span><span>  which  oversea  ships  can  now  be</span><span>  made  to  pay,1  it  is  said,  is  to</span></p> <p><span>  increase  the  despatch  with  which</span><span>  their  cargoes  .  are  handled,  and  lo</span><span>  keep  them  always  at  work.  In  ports</span><span>  possessing  the  accustomed  facilities,  it  is</span><span>  expected,  that  in  a  day.300  to  500  tons</span><span>  pf  goods  should  pass  out  01  into  the</span><span>  hatchway.  Under  such  circumstances,</span><span>  no  proper  inspection  of  a  vessel's  lading</span><span>  is  possible,  and  the  excess  of  speed</span><span>  tenders  it  impossible,  for  the  consignee,</span><span>  as  well  as  the  ship,  to  detect  the  plun-</span><span>  dered  packages  from  the  host  of  .others</span><span>  by  which  they  are  surrounded  or</span><span>  entombed.  Merchants  naturally  com-</span><span>  plain  that  by  this  means  they  frequently</span><span>  accept  goods  they  ought  to  refuse  ;  but,</span><span>  on  the  other  hand,  shipowners  say  we</span><span>  get  so  little  freight,  and  are  compelled</span><span>  to.  drive  our  craft  at  stich  speed</span><span>  that  we  will  accept  nothing  more  than</span><span>  a  responsibility,  for  transit.  We  are</span><span>  i  only  paid  for  rpnveying  the  goods  from</span></p> <p><span>  port  to  port,  arid  little  enough  for  that.</span><span>  \Ve  are  not  paid  to  protect  or  preserve</span><span>  the  merchandise,  and  the  packages</span></p> <p><span>  should  be  strong  enough  to  stand  the</span><span>  wear  and  tear  to  which  they  are  likely  to</span><span>  be  subjected,  and  to-preserre  their  con</span><span>  tents  from  any  mishap  likely  to  overtake</span><span>  them.  This  determipation  is  surely</span><span>  sufficiently  disclosed  by  the  stringent</span><span>  clauses,  in  bills  of  lading  adopted  by</span><span>  nearly  all  steam  lines,  and  if  goods  are</span><span>  intrusted  tb  their  conveyance,  under  such</span><span>  conditions  so.  Well  known  and  expressed,</span><span>  we  question  mitch  whether  those  are  who</span><span>  in  reality  parties  to  thc  contract,  can</span><span>  justly  complain  of  ships  taking  advan-</span><span>  tage  of  the  impunity  that  lias  already</span><span>  been  conceded  to  them  by  shippers,  who</span><span>  are  the  accredited  agents  for  the</span><span>  consignees.  If  the  contention  of  ship-</span><span>  owners  is  tenable-that  by  participating</span><span>  in  the  benefits  of  cheap  freights</span><span>  owners  of  goods  acquiesce  in  the</span><span>  condition  it  is  sought  to  establish  -</span><span>  viz.,  that  ships  arc  merely  paid  freight</span><span>  for  conveyance,  and  that  the  speed  and</span><span>  despatch  with  which  cargo  are  now  of</span></p> <p><span>  necessity  handled,  dispels  the  presump-</span><span>  tion  that  pillages  (most  of  which  show</span><span>  from  careful  measures  adopted  to  restore</span><span>  exterior  packages  to  merchantable</span><span>  appearance,  that  time  and  undisturbed</span><span>  opportunity  are  at  thc  disposal  of  the</span><span>  plunderers)  do  not  occur  while  the  cargo</span><span>  is  under  the  charge  af  the  conveying</span><span>  vessel.  Then  thc  rleterminntion  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Sydney  importers,  to  lake  jrrojter  care  to</span><span>  protect  llicir  goods  from  theft  after</span><span>  landing,  is  a  wisc  one.  In  fact  thc</span><span>  admission  that,  while  remaining  upon  the</span><span>  wharves  in  Sydney,  goods  are  insufli</span><span>  ciently  protected  from  pillage  justifies,  to</span><span>  some  extent,  the  position  assumed  by</span><span>  shipowners!  and  we  would  strongly  urge</span></p> <p><span>  ¿hatííhe  jolpt  committee,  appointed  by</span><span>  our  Municipal  Council  and  Chamber  of</span><span>  Conjiperce,1  fchoilld  take  this  phass  of</span><span>  ""ihevqucsUnp;  into  their;  consideration  in</span></p> <p><span>  framing  their  recommendations  to  \he</span><span>  Municipal  authorities.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  NOVEMBER  13,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  '  ÍN  the  course  of  the  recent  political  j</span></p> <p><span>  struggle  in  the  colony,  references,  were</span></p> <p><span>  frequently  made  to  the  code  of  honor,  I</span><span>  and  no  man  has  been  more  frequent  in</span><span>  his  allusions  to  it  than  the  Premier-the  j</span><span>  Hon.  S.  W.  Griffith.  When  addressing</span><span>  his  friends  at  the  Ipswich  banquet  he</span><span>  pointed  out  several  instances  in  which,</span><span>  in  his  opinion,  the  Ministry  hM  violated</span><span>  this  unwritten  statute.  He  stated,  in</span><span>  most  pointed  language,  that  his  op-</span><span>  ponents  had  ""exhibited  themselves  to  the</span><span>  Australian  colonies,  and  to  the  world,  as</span><span>  setting  at  defiance,  and  trampling  under</span><span>  foot,  every  rule  that  was  in  other  countries</span><span>  laid  down  and  recognised;  because  there</span><span>  were  in  politics,  as  in  private  life,  certain</span><span>  unwritten  rules  of  honour,  which  Wen</span><span>  were  supposed  to  observe.""  On  that</span><span>  occasion  he  also  declared  :-""  His  party</span><span>  would  do  no  wrong,  if  they  could  help</span><span>  it,  but  they  would  do  all  they  could  to</span><span>  right  the  wrongs  that  had  been  done.""</span><span>  One  of  the  wrongs  the  hon.  gentleman</span><span>  referred  to  was  the  appointment  to  the</span><span>  Commission  of  the  Peace  of  men  ""  of</span></p> <p><span>  whom  he  had  DO  hesitation  in  saying,  if</span><span>  he  had  any  voice  in  the  matter,</span><span>  they  would  not  remain  on  that</span><span>  commission  after  the  ist  January  next.""</span><span>  Upon  reading  these  words  it  must  seem</span><span>  most  extraordinary  to  our  readers,  that</span><span>  the  gentleman  who  uttered  them  should</span><span>  have  called  upon  the  Legislative  As-</span><span>  sembly  of  this  colony  to  elect  as  its</span><span>  President  a  man  who  was  described  as</span><span>  ""  a  thrice  convicted  lelon.""  We  put  it</span><span>  to  our  readers  whether  the  Premier  has</span><span>  not  been  guilty  of  something  more</span><span>  than  making  a  serious  mistake,  as  thc</span><span>  Courier  says  ;  whether  he  has  not  been</span><span>  guilty  of  flagrantly  and  of  set  purpose,</span><span>  infringing  those  unwritten  laws  of  honour,</span><span>  which  he  so  recently  argued  deserved</span><span>  and  commanded  observance  among  men</span><span>  of  honour.  It  is  of  the  very  essence  of</span><span>  the  unwritten  laws,  to  which  thc  Premier</span><span>  appealed,  that  honour  should  bc  given</span><span>  to  whom  honour  is  due.  Thc  position</span><span>  of  President  of  the  first  assembly  of</span></p> <p><span>  gentlemen  in  the  colony  is  one  of</span></p> <p><span>  honour.  ""Thc  tradition  of  thc  chair</span><span>  (says  the  Courier)  takes  its  risc  from  the</span><span>  earliest  dawnings  of  the  Parliamentary</span><span>  history  of  our  race.  The  Speaker  of  an</span><span>  English  Assembly  has  always  been  a</span><span>  man  before  whom  every  member,  how-</span><span>  ever  highly  born,  however  elevated  in</span><span>  character,  could  bow  down  in  obedience</span><span>  and  respect.  He  has  betMi  spoken  of  as</span><span>  tlie  first  Commoner,  and  the  dignity  and</span><span>  thc  character  of  the  whole  representative</span><span>  body  is  in  a  manner  centred  in  his</span><span>  person.  The  minor  offices  of  the  House,</span></p> <p><span>  seats  ia  the  Ministry  itself,  may  perhaps</span><span>  be  occupied  by  men  of  indifferent</span><span>  repute,  placed  there  by  the  furce  of</span><span>  I  circumstances  ;  but,  to  the  best  of  our</span></p> <p><span>  belief,  it  has  never  before  happened  that</span><span>  a  Legislative  Assembly,  elected  by  any</span><span>  of  the  English-speaking  race,  has  delibe-</span><span>  rately  chosen  as  its  Speaker  arid  mouth-</span><span>  piece  a  man  whose  history  is  not  free</span><span>  ¡rom  notorious  taint.""  Upon  evidence</span></p> <p><span>  of  this  character  we  think  it  is  indis-</span><span>  putable  that  the  code  of  honour,</span><span>  ""the  unwritten  rules  of  honour,</span></p> <p><span>  which  men  were  supposed  to  observe  ""-  I</span><span>  demanded  that  the  office  of  Speaker</span></p> <p><span>  should  be  held  by  a  gentleman  of  '</span></p> <p><span>  unblemished  reputation,  and  whose</span><span>  character  should  command  respect</span><span>  Nevertheless,  the  Premier  brought  for-</span><span>  ward  a  man  who  did  not  possess  such  a</span><span>  character.  It  was  pointed  out  that  his</span><span>  reputation  was  not  unblemished.  As</span><span>  Sir  Thomas  Mcilwraith  put  it  ""  he  had</span><span>  been  told  by  the  judges  of  hiscountry  that</span><span>  he  is  unfit  to  have  the  ordinary  liberty  of</span><span>  a  citizen.""  Mr.  Archer  protested  against</span><span>  the  appointment  of  a  man  ""  who  had</span><span>  suffered  as  Mr.  Groom  had-a  man  who</span><span>  has  not  shown  by  his  conduct  that  he</span><span>  had  in  any  way  altered  his  character.""</span><span>  He  called  upon  ""  all  honest  men  who</span><span>  love  Queensland  and  love  its  honour  ""</span><span>  to  protest  against  such  an  appointment.</span><span>  Other  hon.  members  spoke  strongly  of</span><span>  the  dishonour  that  would  be  done.  In</span><span>  fact,  they  appealed  to  the  unwritten</span><span>  laws  which  Mr.  Griffith  had  declared  so</span><span>  recently  were  entitled  to  respect,  yet</span><span>  their  words  fell,  as  it  were,  on  deaf  ears.</span><span>  To  show  that  their  hostility  was  not  of  a</span><span>  partisan  nature,  the  Ministry  submitted</span><span>  the  name  of  a  respectable  member</span><span>  of  the  Opposition  for  selection,  but  it</span><span>  was  rejected  without  hesitation.  It  is</span><span>  perfectly  clear,  therefore,  that  the  hon.</span><span>  gentleman  at  the  head  of  the  present</span><span>  Administration  has  openly,  and  in</span><span>  the  face  of  indisguised  opposition,  been</span><span>  guilty  of  breaking  the  code  of  honour.</span><span>  It  does  not  mitigate,  but  rather  aggra-</span><span>  vates  the  offence  that  he  has  done  so  to</span></p> <p><span>  I  meet  the  exigencies  of  party.  He  has</span><span>  j  sacrificed  hoDour  to  party.  Upon  the</span></p> <p><span>  first  occasion  when  he  was  called  upon</span><span>  '  to  chose  between  observance  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  unwritten  laws  of  honour,  and  the</span><span>  recognition  of  the  claims  of  a  political</span><span>  j  adherent,  he  has  disregarded  the  former</span></p> <p><span>  to  satisfy  the  latter.  Whatever  may  be</span><span>  ,  thought  of  the  proceeding  by  men  in</span><span>  I  this  colony,  and  by  those  in  other</span></p> <p><span>  colonies,  is  not  of  so  much,  practical</span><span>  importance  to  us  as  the  abrogation  of</span><span>  the  code  of  honour.  If  it  was  to  be  re-</span><span>  garded  as  a  calamity  that  the  late</span><span>  Govemmefit  had  trampled  the  unwritten</span><span>  laws  under  foot,  what  hope  is  there</span><span>  for  the  people  of  Queensland,  when  the</span><span>  members  of  the  new  Government  com-</span><span>  bine  to  violate  them  in  the  manner  we</span><span>  have  demonstrated.  In  the  conduct  ol</span><span>  the  business  of  the  country  as  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  relations  of  life,  there  are  a  great  many</span><span>  unwritten  rules,  which  men  of  honour</span><span>  must  observe,  and  it  is  on  the  under-</span><span>  standing  they  shall  do  so  that  hon.</span><span>  members  have  positions  of  honour  and</span><span>  trust  conferred  on  them.  Let  these</span><span>  rules  be  disregarded,  and  as  a  matter  of</span><span>  public  safety  we  must  enlarge  our  List  of</span><span>  statutory  penal  offences.  That  seems  to  be</span><span>  the  extremity  to  which  we  are  being</span><span>  driven  by  the  action  of  the  Premier,</span><span>  aad  it  is  one  which  there  is  great  reason</span><span>  to  deplore.  The  man  who  is  knowingly</span><span>  guilty  of  an  act,  pregnant  with  such  con-</span><span>  sequences,  does  more  than  make  a</span><span>  mistake  :  he  commits  an  offence  that</span><span>  deserves  to  be  held  in  universal  public</span><span>  reprobation.</span></p> ",Article,1883-11-13,"The Morning Bulletin ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  ROOK  I  IA  M!'VON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY.  MARCH  21,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  MR.  MACROSSAN  will  have  the  satisfac-</span><span>  tion  on  his  retirement  that  his  worst</span><span>  enemies  have  al  length  paid  tribute  to</span><span>  his  indefatigable  industry  as  an  adminis-</span><span>  trator,  and  to  his  power  as  a  public</span><span>  debater.  The  Brisbane  Telegraph,</span><span>  naturally  enough,  could  not  join  in  the</span><span>  universal  tribute  without  following  it  up</span><span>  with  some  unworthy  inuendoes  and</span><span>  insinuations,  but  that  is  characteristic  of</span><span>  the  Telegraph  in  dealing  with  the</span><span>  political  opponents  of  the  parly  which</span><span>  it  serves.  Some  of  our  southern  con-</span><span>  temporaries  have  not  yet  spoken  on  the</span><span>  subject,  but  the  cordiality  with  which</span><span>  most  of  them  testify  lo  Mr.  Macrossan's</span><span>  good  qualities  proves  that  if  he  has  not</span><span>  been  a  popularity-seeker  he  has  won  that</span><span>  which  is  far  more  valuable  to  an  honest</span><span>  and  strong-minded  man-appreciation</span><span>  and  esteem  from  opponents  as  well  as</span><span>  friends.  The  public  man  who  subsists</span><span>  upon  the  thoughtless  hurrahs  of  the</span><span>  crowd  will  never  become  robust  upon</span><span>  his  fare.  Mr.  Macrossan  was  a  real</span><span>  working  politician,  and,  after  his  ten</span><span>  years  of  assiduous  labour,  lie  lus  cer-</span><span>  tainly  earned  the  privilege  of  the  retire-</span><span>  ment  without  existing  detraction.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  business  now,  however,  is  chiefly</span><span>  with  his  successor.  Mr.  Norton,  a  most</span><span>  excellent  man,  bas  had  the  misfortune</span><span>  to  represent  the  constituency  of  Glad-</span><span>  stone,  which  is  guided  by  a  few  property</span><span>  owners  who  want  their  port  made  a  big</span><span>  city  at  the  public  expense.  If  anything</span></p> <p><span>  bas  tarnished  the  brightness  of  Mr.</span><span>  Norton's  political  career,  it  is  the_  too</span><span>  conscientious  representation  of  the  wishes</span><span>  of  his  selfish  constituents.  It  was  his</span><span>  repeated  and  exhaustive  speeches  tn</span><span>  favour  of  the  Gladstone  pier  and  har-</span><span>  bour,  and  his  unceasing  denunciation  of</span><span>  the  Fitzroy  ""ditch""  and  Eupatoria</span></p> <p><span>  ""mud  bank""  that  lost  him  for  a  con-</span></p> <p><span>  siderable  time  the  ear  of  the  House.  (</span><span>  For  members  of  the  Assembly  will  not</span><span>  be  bored  with  a  grievance,  or  allow  one</span><span>  man  to  continually  thrust  his  opinions</span><span>  down  their  throats.  And  yet  it  is</span><span>  reported  that  in  seeking  re-election  now</span><span>  he  has  accepted  office,  Mr.  Norton  will</span><span>  be  opposed,  and  possibly  defeated.</span><span>  From  one  point  of  view  we  should</span><span>  be  glad  to  see  this  happen,  for  there  are</span><span>  several  constituencies  in  the  colony  who</span><span>  would  be  delighted  to  secure  Mr.</span><span>  Norton's  services  at  the  general  election.</span><span>  He  is  far  too  good  a  man  to  be  worried</span><span>  by  the  political  wire-pullers  of  his  present</span><span>  constituency.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Census  returns  show  that  the</span><span>  electorate  of  Gladstone  is  absurdly  over-</span><span>  represented.  In  May,  i88r,  it  contained</span><span>  only  571  adult  males,  including  42</span><span>  Chinese  and  Kanakas.  Compare  this</span><span>  with  the  adult  males  in  the  other  central</span><span>  electorates.  In  Rockhampton  they</span><span>  numbered  1653  ;  in  Mitchell,  2825  ;  in</span><span>  Leichhardt,  2180  ;  and  in  Blackall,  1331.</span><span>  It  is  unreasonable,  therefore,  on  the  part</span><span>  of  the  Gladstone  people  to  expect  their</span><span>  ?  member,  who  is  only  one  in  fifty-five,  to</span></p> <p><span>  compel  attention  to  and  seek  the  redress</span><span>  of  his  constituents  grievances.  Cer-</span><span>  tainly  by  rejecting  Mr.  Norton  they</span><span>  would  not  advance  their  cause,  foi</span><span>  of  necessity  he  must  be  more  in-</span><span>  fluential  as  a  Minister  than  he</span><span>  possibly  could  be  as  a  private  member,</span><span>  and  infinitely  more  influential  than  any</span><span>  other  member  that  the  Gladstone  people</span><span>  .  would  be  likely  to  command,</span></p> <p><span>  s  On  the  whole,  therefore,  we  doubt  i</span><span>  \  Mr.  Norton  will  meet  with  any  rea!</span><span>  i  opposition,  unless  for  the  purpose  o</span><span>  \  getting  money  spent.  We  do  no</span><span>  fc  suspect  the  new  Minister  for  Works  o</span><span>  .  the  -folly  of  buying  his  way  into  thi</span></p> <p><span>  Cabinet.  The  game  is  not  worth  th&lt;</span><span>  candle  now  that  the  end  of  the  Parliamen</span><span>  r  is  so  close  at  hand;  and  Mr.  Norton  ii</span><span>  a  toa  conscientious  a  gentleman  to  descent</span><span>  .  to  such  an  unworthy  proceeding  in  an;</span><span>  }  event.  Still  some  Opposition  man  ma;</span></p> <p><span>  possibly  be  encouraged  by  great  Libera</span><span>  promises  and  Queen-street  money  ti</span><span>  1  make  a  flutter  for  the  seat.

First,  we  would  point  to  i</span><span>  report  hy  the  Rev.  \V.  M  lyew  on  th</span><span>  state  of  the  agricultural  classes  of  Knj</span><span>  land,  anil  we  find  that  gentleman  rc</span><span>  porting  the  tenant  fanner  and  sim</span><span>  landholder  were  heilig  driven  gradual)</span><span>  but  surely  to  poverty,  while  in  Hie  sinai</span><span>  and  large  towns  lawyers  were  Imildin</span><span>  large  mansions,  and  Banks  and  Ir,</span><span>  surance  companies  were  erecting  magn</span><span>  ficent  structures.  Here  is  evidence  thu</span><span>  the  advancement  of  Binking  Institution</span></p> <p><span>  was  marked  by  a  corresponding  deterior-</span><span>  ation  in  agriculture.  Again  turning  to</span><span>  Ireland  we  find  that,  year  by  year,  as</span><span>  the  Bank  continued  declaring  magni-</span><span>  ficent  dividends,  the  peasantry,  and  in</span><span>  fact  the  bulk  of  the  population,  was</span><span>  being  driven  to  absolute  starvation</span><span>  and  again  we  ask  does  the  progress  of</span><span>  Banking  institutions,  mark  the  advance-</span></p> <p><span>  ment  of  a  country?</span></p> <p><span>  In  looking  into  the  operations  of  these</span><span>  financial  syndicates-for  such  they  are  to</span><span>  a  great  extent,  if  not  entirely.  We  find</span><span>  that  their  actual  interest  lies  mainly  in</span><span>  the  speculative  proclivities  of  their</span><span>  clients.  The  man  who  establishes  a</span><span>  business  upon  bills  has  to  work  day  and</span><span>  night,  and  rack  his  brain  and  constitu-</span><span>  tion,  in  the  effort  to  meet  these  bills.</span><span>  Very  frequently  he  is  unable  to  do  so,  and</span><span>  this  actually  tends  to  the  advantage  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  Bank  that  has  accepted  his  ;</span><span>  paper  so  long  as  he  can'  pay  in-</span><span>  terest,  and  show  reasonable  assets</span><span>  to  insure  the  safety  of  renewals.</span><span>  The  larger  number  of  clients  of  this  class</span><span>  that  a  bank  possesses  the  better  for  it  ;</span><span>  but  the  larger  number  of  these  in  a</span><span>  country  shows  that  in  developing  its</span><span>  resources'  and  advancing  its  industries,</span><span>  the  people  generally  do  not  progress</span><span>  they  merely  work  for  the  Banks.  But</span><span>  as  another  evidence  almost  conclusive</span><span>  of  the  fact  that  the  advancement  of  the</span><span>  Banks,  is  not  a  certain  indication  of  a</span><span>  country's  progress,  we  quote  the  follow-</span><span>  ing  figures  again  from  the  Economist,</span><span>  showing  the  value  of  imports  into  the</span><span>  United  Kingdom  from  Australia  :</span></p> <p><span>  1832.  1881.  mo.  187».</span></p> <p><span>  O  month!  ..22,400.000  24,000,000  22,257.000  19,«80,000</span><span>  ¿dd  «old....  2,283,000  8,(72,000  1,007,000  2,603,000</span></p> <p><span>  Totals  ....21,778,000  28,182,000  23,804,000  22,499,000</span></p> <p><span>  This  exhibits  that,  while  in  1882  the</span><span>  Banks  could  declare  increased  dividends,</span><span>  the  exports  from  the  Colonies  had  de-</span><span>  ceased.  Of  course  during  this  period</span><span>  tie  crops  in  different  Colonies  had</span><span>  fitted  ;  and  this  fact  at  once  shows  that</span><span>  the  failure  of  the  crop  compelled  the</span><span>  agriculturist  to  seek  accommodation,</span><span>  and  hence  his  disaster  proved  the</span></p> <p><span>  benefit  of  the  Banks.</span></p> <p><span>  Lately,  however,  we  have  had  un-</span><span>  mistakable  proof  that  the  Banks  are  not</span><span>  inclined  to  accommodate  to  such  lengths</span><span>  as  hitherto.'  They  realise  that  to  allow</span><span>  their  clients  to  go  on  borrowing  to  pay</span><span>  off  interest,  and  to  continue  endeavouring</span><span>  to  cheat  the  inevitable  result  of  agri-</span><span>  cultural  disaster  must  end  in  bankruptcy,</span><span>  arti  before  the  assets  have  become  too</span><span>  '  diminished,  it  has  been  decided  to  put</span></p> <p><span>  on  the  break.  What  effect  this  will</span><span>  hate  generally  it  is  impossible  to  tell,</span><span>  but  very  fortunately  a  most  prosperous</span><span>  season  in  several  colonies  -  more</span><span>  especially  in  Queensland-induces  the</span><span>  hope  that  one  year  of  plenty  may  make</span><span>  amends  for  the  years  of  famine.  Certain</span><span>  it  is,  however,  that  a  vast  amount  of</span><span>  unhealthy  speculation  will  be  pre-</span><span>  vented,  and  real  estate  at  all  events  will</span><span>  assume  its  true  value.  From  this  condi-</span><span>  tion  of  affairs  the  legitimate  trader  has</span><span>  nothing  to  fear,  and  it  will  only  be  the</span><span>  gambling  speculator  that  will  grumble.</span><span>  Undoubtedly  values  will  be  fixed  upon  a</span><span>  sound  and  reliable  basis,  trade  will  be</span><span>  conducted  upon  genuine  principles,  and</span><span>  we  shall  really  know  our  exact  position.</span><span>  The  hard  facts  that  are  forcing  them-</span><span>  selves  upon  the  public,  with  regard  to</span><span>  the  colonial  money  market,  may  be</span><span>  unpalatable,  but  it  is  far  better  to  realise</span><span>  that  there  are  breakers  ahead,  than  to</span><span>  proceed  on  blindly,  and  suffer  wreck</span><span>  upon  the  unseen  rocks.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  understand  that  the  Government  have</span><span>  assessed  at  £60  the  improvements  on  tho</span><span>  pieoo  of  grouod  purchased  by  the  Rev.

They</span><span>  give  no  dates  os  to  when  they  commenced  to</span><span>  uso  it.  I  am  now  in  my  seventy-fifth  year,  and</span><span>  have  witnessed  several  epidemics  of  dysen-</span><span>  tery,  typhoid,  scarlet,  and  relapsing  fevers,</span><span>  smallpox,  measles,  Ac,  and  have  used  milk  in</span><span>  every  case  coming  under  my  caro  for  nearly</span><span>  forty  years  in  every  stage  of  tho  disease.  I</span><span>  will  uot  say  it  ie  a  cure,  for  I  do  not  believe</span><span>  in  the  so-called  '  cures  '  and  '  speaifios,'  Milk</span><span>  ie  the  natural  food  of  all  mammalians.

Mercury  in  any  of  its</span><span>  preparations  is  poison  in  dysentery  or  scarlet</span><span>  fever,  and  the  physician  who  gives  them  will</span><span>  never  be  very  successful.  If  his  patient  re-</span><span>  covers  it  will  be  despite  his  treatment.  I  will</span><span>  add  that  in  small-pox  and  scarlet  fever  I</span><span>  anoint  the  patient  from  head  to  feet  with  olive</span><span>  oil  by  means  of  a  badger  brash,  and  repeat  as</span><span>  often  as  it  disappears,  thereby  allaying  the</span><span>  heat,  keeping  open  the  poreB  of  the  skin,  pro-</span><span>  ducing  quietude,  preventing  congestion  of  the</span><span>  capillary  circulation,  and  obviating  tho  neces-</span><span>  sity  of  anodynes.

APRIL  17,  188Ï.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  internal  affairs  of  religious  bodies</span><span>  are  not  usually  considered  fair  subjects</span><span>  of  criticism  on  the  part  of  thc  press,  ex-</span><span>  cept  in  those  relations  in  which  they</span><span>  touch  the  interests  of  other  sections  of</span><span>  the  community.  Happily  all  the  sections</span><span>  of  the  Church  in  these  colonies,  are</span><span>  equally  separated  from  the  state.  None</span><span>  can  claim  precedence  or  privilege  as,</span><span>  even  in  a  modified  sense,  the  Established</span><span>  or  State  Church,  and  all  are  alike  free  to</span><span>  pursue  their  own  path  and  objects,  so</span><span>  long  as  they  infringe  on  no  civil  right</span><span>  enjoyed  by  other  members  or  sections</span><span>  of  the  public.  The  numbers  belonging</span><span>  to  any  sect,  or  the  personal  qualities</span><span>  of  its  ministers,  may  secure  for  it  a  larger</span><span>  measure  of  public  attention  than  is</span><span>  accorded  to  other  sects,  but  it  is  only  in</span><span>  exceptional  cases  that  the  affairs  or</span><span>  interests  of  any  one  denomination</span><span>  become  public  property  in  the  way  of</span><span>  discussion.  Such  exceptional  cases  do</span><span>  from  time  to  time  arise,  as,  for  example,</span><span>  when  a  religious  party-demands,  that  the</span><span>  views  which  it  holds  should  guide  or</span><span>  modify  the  course  of  legislation  ;  or  when</span><span>  by  challenging  public  attention  to  its</span><span>  proceedings,  it  invites  the  criticism  of</span><span>  those  whose  atteution  it  has  sought.</span><span>  It  can  be  only  on  the  latter  ground  that</span><span>  we  call  attention  to  an  event  which</span><span>  has  been  made  the  subject  of  comment</span><span>  by^  the  press  of  Victoria.  We  refer  to</span><span>  the  opening  of  .the  19th  session  of  the</span><span>  Theological  Hall  of  the  Presbyterian</span><span>  Church  of  Victoria  ;  and  the  ground  on</span><span>  which  we  think  the  attention  of  our</span><span>  readers  may  be  called  to  this  is,  that  thc</span><span>  Theological  Hall  of  the  Church  named</span><span>  is  part  of  the  (.etching  machinery  of</span><span>  Ormond  College-an  institution  which,</span><span>  though  under  the  management  of  the</span><span>  Presbyterian  Church  of  Victoria,  is  yet</span><span>  open,  in  regard  to  some  of  its  classes</span><span>  and  scholarships,  to  students  of  any  de-</span><span>  nomination  whatever.  Ormond  College</span><span>  is  one  of  the  great  institutions  of  Mel-</span><span>  bourne.  Willi  the  Church  of  iMnIand</span><span>  College  it  stands  dose  by  the  buildings</span><span>  of  the  Melbourne  University,  and  is  nut</span><span>  dwarfed  by  either.  Its  erection  has  been</span><span>  due  mainly  to  thc  munificent  liberality  of</span><span>  Mr.  Francis  Ormond  ;  bul  his  original</span><span>  subscription  of  nearly  .-£23,000  has  been</span><span>  supplemented  by  other  subscriptions,</span><span>  which  bring  up  the  total  to  about</span><span>  ¿¿jS.ooo,  exclusive  of  .£10,000  given</span><span>  by  the  same  gentleman  for  the  erection</span><span>  of  a  boarding-house  for  thc  students.  If</span><span>  we  mistake  not,  this  same  Mr.  Ormond,</span><span>  though  a  loyal  member  of  his  own</span><span>  Church,  has  offered  the  sum  of  ¿£25,000</span><span>  towards  the  completion  of  the  Anglican</span><span>  Cathedral  of  Melbourne.  As  might  be</span><span>  expected,  a  public  ceremonial  closely</span><span>  connected  willi  a  great  institution,</span><span>  founded  by  a  man  of  so  broad  and  en-</span><span>  lightened  sympathies,  attracted  some</span><span>  measure  of  attention  at  the  hands  of  the</span><span>  Melbourne  Press  ;  and  the  utterances  of</span><span>  the  chief  speaker  on  the  occasion,  the</span><span>  Rev.  Dr.  Macdonald,  of  Emerald  Hill,</span><span>  one  of  the  Professors  in  the  Presbyterian</span><span>  Theological  Hall,  could  hardly  pass</span></p> <p><span>  without  being  freely  canvassed.  We</span><span>  do  not  intend  to  review  the  somewhat</span><span>  sharp  criticism  to  which  the  rev.  gentle-</span><span>  man's  address  has  been  subjected  by  the</span><span>  Melbourne  Argus.  The  Doctor  is</span><span>  evidently  a  theologian  of  the  old  school,</span><span>  and  yet  for  a  man,  who  has  been  in  the</span><span>  Ministry  for  over  forty  years,  he  is  as</span><span>  evidently  a  man  of  no  little  advance-</span><span>  ment  of  thought.  He  discoursed  to  the</span><span>  assembled  students,  clergymen,  and</span><span>  others  on  ""  The  Origin  of  the  Church,""</span><span>  endeavouring  to  show  that  this  world</span><span>  exists  for  man,  anil  that  the  whole</span><span>  process  of  its  formation  has  been</span><span>  carried  forward,  to  make  it  the</span><span>  theatre  for  the  accomplishment  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  moral  and  spiritual  constitution  |</span><span>  of  man.  We  are  not  disposed  to  say  j</span><span>  that  the  speaker  made  the  most  skilful  |</span></p> <p><span>  and  successful  use  of  the  materials  at</span><span>  his  hands  ;  nor  are  we  prepared  to  say</span></p> <p><span>  that  the  criticisms  passed  upon  his  I</span><span>  !  remarks  by  the  Argus  are  free  from  that</span></p> <p><span>  narrowness  of  view  with  which  it  charges</span><span>  Dr.  Macdonald.  There  is  scientific</span><span>  narrowness  as  well  as  theological  nar-</span><span>  rowness.  The  sciolists  of  science  are,</span><span>  in  their  way,  as  unreliable  teachers  as</span><span>  the  dogmatists  of  theology  ;  and  when</span><span>  narrowness  is  conjoined  with  vagueness,</span><span>  as  is  not  seldom  the  case,  the  value  of</span><span>  its  teaching  becomes  very  slight  indeed.</span><span>  It  is  easy  to  write  such  sentences  as</span><span>  these:  ""Christianity  remains  to  us,  but</span><span>  it  is  viewed  somewhat  ditterently  troiu</span><span>  what  it  was  when  the  middle-aged</span><span>  amongst  us  were  young.  It  is  useless</span><span>  for  clergy  or  laity  to  revive  the  dry</span><span>  bones  of  some  of  the  old  dogmas,  which</span><span>  were  once  accepted  without  question,</span><span>  and  implicitly  believed  ;""  but  it  is  by  no</span><span>  means  so  easy  to  say  how  much,  or  how</span><span>  little,  the  writer  means  by  them.  And</span><span>  in  this  very  vagueness  we  see  one</span><span>  of  the  strongest  arguments  for  that</span><span>  which  Dr.  Macdonald  desiderates</span><span>  -the  more  thorough  training  of</span><span>  clergymen  than  has  hitherto  prevailed,</span><span>  not  only  in  literature,  philosophy,  and</span><span>  theology,  but  also  in  the  science  of  the</span><span>  day.  Ii  the  studies  and  the  daily</span><span>  reading  of  clergyman  enable  them  to</span><span>  reason  only  on  the  premises,  which  were</span><span>  patent  to  their  grandfathers,  or  their</span><span>  ancestors  of  two  or  three  centuries  back,</span><span>  they  will  soon  find  themselves  left  behind</span><span>  even  hy  the  humbler  and  less  informed</span><span>  portions  of  their  flocks.  On  the  other</span><span>  hand,  science,  to  be  worthy  of  the  name,</span><span>  must  be  definite  and  specific.  Science</span><span>  is  facts  ascertained  and  systematised</span><span>  things  known  by  themselves  and  in  their</span><span>  mutual  relations.  When,  therefore,  scien-</span><span>  tific  men,  taking  their  stand  on  a  certain</span><span>  class  ol  facts  as  firmly  established,  pro-</span><span>  ceed  to  the  denial  of  certain  other</span><span>  hitherto  supposed  facts,  they  must  be</span><span>  prepared  to  show  that  the  logical  con</span><span>  nection  is  beyond  question,  and  to  define</span><span>  how  far  their  negation  extends.  It  is</span><span>  easy  to  concede  to  the  truly  scientific</span><span>  man,  fo  the  man  who  rigidly  adheres  to</span><span>  scientific,  that  is  logical,  methods,  the</span><span>  position  of  an  Agnostic.  His  science</span><span>  deals  with  those  things  which  come</span><span>  under  his  observation  ;  and  of  those</span><span>  which  do  not  come  within  this  sphere,</span><span>  he  is  content  to  say,  ""  They  be  beyond</span><span>  the  ken  of  my  science  :  I  simply  do</span><span>  not  know  them.""  On  this  ground  wc</span><span>  can  conceive  of  a  scientific  Agnostic</span><span>  being  a  devoutly  religious  man.</span><span>  But  this  is  ground  which  we  find</span><span>  only  the  masters  in  science  taking</span><span>  up,  and  strictly  adhering  to;  while</span><span>  no  such  restraints  limit  the  argu-</span><span>  mentative  flights  of  not  a  few  of</span><span>  their  followers  If  there  is  any  truth</span><span>  in  these  remarks,  the  churches  have  need</span><span>  to  look  well  to  the  training  which  they</span><span>  provide  for  the  rising  ministry.  New</span><span>  South  Wales  is  not  behind  Victoria  in</span><span>  the  machinery,  in  buildings  at  least,  for</span><span>  this  purpose.  It  has  its  Angelican,</span><span>  Presbyterian,  and  Wesleyan  Colleges,</span><span>  affiliated  to  the  University;  hut  there  isno</span><span>  evidence  that  the  course  of  study  ranges</span><span>  far  beyond  the  limits  that  were  prescribed</span><span>  in  the  theological  schools  of  half  a</span><span>  century  ago.  Queensland  is  still  in  her</span><span>  infancy  in  these  matters,  None  ol  the</span><span>  churches  possess  any  institution  in  which</span><span>  their  candidates  for  the  ministry  arc  re-</span><span>  quired  to  undergo  any  specific  training.</span><span>  There  is  an  institution  in  Brisbane</span><span>  knoivn  as  ""  Divinity  Hall,""  but  it  seems</span><span>  to  be  matter  of  dispute,  whether  it  has</span><span>  any  connection  whatever  with  the  Pres-</span><span>  byterian  Church,  whose  name  it  some</span><span>  !  times  seems  to  assume  ;  and  so  far  as</span></p> <p><span>  any  published  evidence  goes  it  appears</span><span>  to  afford  a  literary  training,  which  does</span><span>  not  come  up  to  the  standard  of  the</span><span>  senior  forms  in  our  Grammar  Schools.</span><span>  We  believe  that  the  several  churches  have</span><span>  a  standard  of  attainment  fortheirministry,</span><span>  more  or  less  defined,  but,  we  fear,  often</span><span>  very  elastic,  and  in  some  cases  wonder-</span><span>  fully  low.  The  prospects  of  the</span><span>  churches,  in  respect  to  the  qualifications</span><span>  of  their  future  teachers,  cannot,  therefore,</span><span>  be  said  to  be  very  bright.  We  know</span><span>  well  that  not  a  few  of  the  abler  and</span><span>  belter  educated  clergymen  amongst  us</span><span>  are  deeply  alive  to  this,  and  it  will  not</span><span>  weaken  their  hands  to  paint  out  the</span><span>  urgent  and  growing  need  there  is  for  the</span><span>  broadening  and  deepening  the  training</span><span>  which  their  successors  receive.  If,  as</span><span>  the  Argus  says,  ""  Christianity  remains  to</span><span>  us,""  it  requires  expositors,  who  not  only</span><span>  know  wh.it  it  is  in  itself,  but  who  can</span><span>  show  thc  relations  in  which  it  stands  to</span><span>  those  other  departments  of  human</span><span>  knowledge  which  overlap  it,  or  impinge</span><span>  upon  it:  expositors  who,  if  not  scientists</span><span>  themselves,  can  yet  follow  up,  and</span><span>  appreciate  thc  results  of  scientific  inquiry,</span><span>  and  comprehend  the  character  of  the</span><span>  evidence  on  which  these  results  rest.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  tho  Police  Court,  yesterday,  before  Mr.</span><span>  Ci.

The  case  of  Archibald</span><span>  Macmillan  and  Agnes  Connolly  was  the  first</span><span>  called  on.  The  prisoners  were  committed  by</span><span>  the  Blackall  Bench  for  trial  for  the  murder  of</span><span>  the  female  prisoner's  husband  ia  November</span><span>  last.  They  were  charged  yesterday  with</span><span>  the  leaser  crime  of  manslaughter,  and</span><span>  the  trial  lasted  all  day.  As  the  male</span><span>  prisoner  is  well  known  in  Rockhampton,</span></p> <p><span>  the  evidence  was  listened  to  with  keen</span><span>  interest.  So  far  only  two  witnesses  were</span><span>  examined,  and  it  is  very  evident  the  hearing</span><span>  is  likely  to  last  over  to-day.  Messrs.  C.  N.</span><span>  Birkbeck  and  O.  Ryan,  were  excused  from</span><span>  attendance  as  jurors  through  illness.  Mr.</span><span>  Mr.  Forward  applied  for  exemption,  as  be  was</span><span>  a  Licentiate  of  the  Royal  College  of  Surgeons.</span><span>  He  was  informed  by  his  Honor,  that  he  should</span><span>  have  applied  to  the  Jury  Court  of  revision  to</span></p> <p><span>  have  Ins  name  struck  off  tho  roll.  The</span><span>  juror«  were  taken  to  the  Cremorne  Hotel  for</span><span>  thc  night,  as  there  was  no  hotel  Accommoda-</span><span>  tion  available  in  town.  Tbe  Court  rose  at</span><span>  5J45  p.m.  and  sits  at  ten  this  morning.</span></p> <p><span>  A  CURIOUS  case  of  illegally  pawning  is  thus</span><span>  reported  in  the  Melbourne  Age  :-A  case  was</span><span>  before  the  Emerald-hill  bench  of  magistrates</span><span>  yesterday,  (April  4)  in  which  a  man  named</span><span>  Ralph  Lewis  Robiuson  was  charged,  under</span><span>  the  34th  section  of  thc  Pawnbrokers'  Statue,</span><span>  with  illegally  pawniug  a  gold  locket  and  chain,</span><span>  thc  property  of  one  George  Jessop.  Mr.  Daly</span><span>  defended  the  accused  ¡  Inspector  Toohey</span><span>  prosecuting.  Thc  case  appeared  to  be  that</span><span>  the  accused  lived  with  prosecutor,  as  lodger,</span><span>  at  Rockhampton,  Queensland,  in  December</span><span>  last.  During  that  month  there  «as  »quarrel</span><span>  in  the  household.  Tho  prosecutor  left  Rock-</span><span>  hampton,  and  afterwards  went  back,  lu  tho</span><span>  meantime  the  prisoner  and  Mrs.  Jessop  bad</span><span>  removed  to  Melbourne,  afterwards  finding</span><span>  their  way  tn  Kmerald-hill,  whore  they  lived</span><span>  together  as  man  and  wife.  It  was  alleged  by</span><span>  Helena  Jessop,  the  wife  of  thc  prosecutor,</span><span>  that  her  husband  agreed  that  she  should  take</span><span>  certain  articles  of  furniture  as  ber  share,  at</span><span>  the  timo  of  the  split  up  in  Rockhampton,</span><span>  and  also  some  jewellery,  among  which</span><span>  was  the  gold  chain  which  was  alleged</span><span>  to  have  been  illegally  pawned  by  accused.</span><span>  I'roscentor  subsequently  met  his  wife  and  thc</span><span>  accused  at  Hmerald-hill.  He  accosted  them,</span><span>  and  inquired  about  the  jewellery  which  he  bari</span><span>  found  had  been  pawned  at  the  Hmcrald-hill</span></p> <p><span>  branch  of  the  Australian  Mont  dc  IV-U'-.  A</span></p> <p><span>  conversation  ensued,  which  appeared  to  have</span><span>  been  of  a  semi-friendly  nature.  On  another</span><span>  occasion,  prosecutor,  his  wife  and  two  children</span><span>  met  in  Melbourne,  and,  as  they  approached</span><span>  thc  corner  of  Collins  and  Queen  streets,  Con-</span><span>  stable  Bysouth  was  referred  tn  by  prosecutor.</span><span>  1'he  countable  said  lie  could  not  taite  Robinson</span><span>  in  charee  on  the  information  then  afforded.</span><span>  Subsequently  the  police  of  Emerald-hill  were</span><span>  communicated  with,  and  a  warrant  issued  on</span><span>  which  the  prisoner  was  arrested  by  Senior</span><span>  ooiistaMe  R.igcrs.

"<p><span>  -  -=  1</span></p> <p><span>  KOCKIIAMl'  ION.  j</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY,  APRIL  20,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  EDUCATION  is  becoming  an  art,  and  the</span><span>  question  which  must  present  itself  to</span><span>  the  minds  of  many  intelligent  parents  is</span><span>  -whether  there  is  not  a  tendency</span><span>  among  teachers  to  become  dilettanti</span><span>  artists,  rather  than  earnest,  anxious,</span><span>  faithful  instructors  of  youth  ?  A  cardinal</span><span>  fact,  that  should  always  be  borne  in</span><span>  mind,  when  thc  subject  of  education</span><span>  is  under  consideration,  is  that  the  re</span><span>  sponsibility  for  the  proper  up-bringing  of</span><span>  the  young  rests  on  parents.  It  is  a  duty</span><span>  they  owe  their  offspring  to  see  they  are</span><span>  so  trained  and  taught  that,  in  intelli-</span><span>  gence,  they  shall  be  able  to  take  their</span><span>  place  with  credit  among  their  fellows  ;</span><span>  and,  in  general  knowledge  and  attain-</span><span>  ments,  be  able  to  assist  in  the  good</span><span>  government  of  the  community  in  which</span><span>  they  are  placed,  and  in  advancing  the</span><span>  moral,  intellectual,  and  physicial  con-</span><span>  dition  of  the  human  race.  To  the  State</span><span>  parents  also  owe  it  that  their  childrtn</span><span>  shall  not  grow  up  pests  to  Society,  and</span><span>  propagators  of  moral  and  social  evils.</span><span>  Willi  thc  view  to  assist  citizens,  in</span><span>  their  efforts  for  ihe  accomplishment  of</span><span>  these  aims,  the  Governments  of  nearly</span><span>  every  country  have  provided  systems  of</span><span>  education  suited  to  the  public  require-</span><span>  ments.  The  result  is  that  parents  lose  sigh  t</span><span>  of  their  individual  responsibilities,  in</span><span>  regari!  to  the  education  of  their  children.</span><span>  They  seem  to  think  that  their  duty  is</span><span>  sufficiently  performed  when  ihcy  make</span></p> <p><span>  their  children  attend  school.  As  a  con-</span><span>  sequence  those  immediately  engaged  in</span><span>  the  profession  of  leaching,  have  been</span><span>  left  to  do  very  much  as  they  liked,  and</span><span>  the  result,  as  wc  remarked  al  the  outset,</span><span>  has  been  thc  growth  of  a  disposition</span><span>  among  teachers  to  theorise,  experiment,</span></p> <p><span>  and  reduce  their  work  to  the  smallest</span></p> <p><span>  amount.  Like  other  workers  they  strive</span><span>  to  sell  their  lil>oiir  al  as  good  a  price  as</span><span>  they  can  get  for  it,  .ind  it  is  lo  be  feared</span><span>  many  of  them  are  not  so  thoughtful  as</span><span>  they  should  be  of  (he  dangers  to  the</span><span>  Stale,  that  are  certain  to  arise  from</span><span>  l'ic  careless  and  perfunctory  discharge</span></p> <p><span>  of  their  duties.</span></p> <p><span>  In  connection  with  this  state  of</span></p> <p><span>  matters,  we  may  he  permitted  to  call</span></p> <p><span>  attention  lo  the  amount  of  tasks  allotted</span><span>  lo  children  f&lt;ir  performance  at  home.</span><span>  The  number,  variety,  and  amount  of</span><span>  home-lessons,  especially  in  connection</span><span>  willi  higher-class  education,  form  a</span><span>  serious  tax  upon  the  time,  and  physical</span><span>  and  mental  powers  of  pupils.  If  the</span><span>  teachers  are  spoken  to  upon  ihe  subject,</span><span>  they  are  ready  with  the  response  that</span><span>  the  demands  nf  modern  high-class  educa-</span><span>  tion  ren  ier  hume  -  lessons  necessary.</span><span>  They  tell  indignant  parents  that  the  ex-</span><span>  tent  of  human  knowledge  is  such  pupils</span><span>  must  be  at  their  work  late  and  early,  in</span><span>  order  to  leam  the  ways  of  access  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  numerous  branches  into  which  it  is</span><span>  divided  ;  and  that  the  most  teachers</span><span>  can  do  is  to  direct  and  supervise  the</span><span>  labours  of  youth.  Behind  technicalities</span><span>  and  professional  jargon  they  sheller</span><span>  themselves,  and  with  plausible  argu-</span><span>  ments  throw  up  a  rampart  to  protect</span><span>  them  from  criticism.  We  must  not  shut</span></p> <p><span>  our  eyes  to  the  fact  that  the  multiplica-</span><span>  tion  of  home-lessons  is  becoming  a</span><span>  serious  social  question  ;  and  there  are</span><span>  many  points  in  connection  with  it  which</span><span>  demand  the  attention  of  intelligent</span><span>  parents.  With  the  latter  rests  the</span><span>  remedy  of  evils  which  may  arise,  for  the</span><span>  manipulation  of  School  Boards  and</span><span>  Trustees  by  teachers  is  becoming  a  part</span><span>  of  the  science  of  education  from  the</span></p> <p><span>  tatters'  point  of  view.  The  prominent</span><span>  question,  which  should  engage  our  atten-</span><span>  tion,  as  it  is  doing  that  of  communities</span><span>  farther  south,  is-whether  the  hard.work</span><span>  of  teaching  is  not  being  expelled  from</span><span>  the  public  school  to  the  domestic  circle  ?</span><span>  Boys  and  girls  alike  are  burdened  with</span><span>  exercises.  The  performance  of  these</span><span>  occupies  all  the  hours  they  are  at  home,</span><span>  and  leads  to  an  invasion  of  the  Saturday</span><span>  holiday;  indeed,  it  may  be  questioned,  if</span><span>  it  does  not  give  rise  to  Sabbath  dese-</span><span>  cration.  Where  the  classes  are  at  all</span><span>  numerous  the  teacher  can  do  no  tnore</span><span>  than  hear  the  pupils  repeat  their</span><span>  tasks.  Under  such  a  system  there</span><span>  is  a  great  deal  of  learning  hy</span><span>  rote  without  intelligent  comprehen-</span><span>  sion.  Education  imparted  in  this  fashion</span><span>  becomes  an  annoyance  to  pupils,  and</span><span>  instead  of  being  a  stimulus  is  a  sedative</span><span>  to  the  acquisition  of  knowledge.  Youths</span><span>  when  they  leave  school  throw  aside  their</span><span>  books  with  a  feeling  of  joyous  relief.</span><span>  Only  in  a  few  cases  is  there  a  spon-</span><span>  taneous  desire  to  drink  deeper  at  the</span><span>  wells  of  knowledge,  or  acquire  literary</span><span>  or  scientific  distinction.  It  is  a  question,</span><span>  indeed,  whether  the  revulsion  of  feeling</span><span>  created  is  not  highly  detrimental  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  interests  of  true  education.</span></p> <p><span>  A  great  objection  to  the  extravagant</span><span>  system  of  home-lessons  is  the  time  they</span><span>  occupy.  Pupils  have  no  leisure  for</span><span>  i  recreation  and  relaxation.  Play,  so</span></p> <p><span>  delightful,  and,  we  may  say,  necessary  to</span><span>  the  young,  is  denied  them.  If  it  be</span><span>  indulged  in,  and  some  task  forgot  or</span><span>  neglected,  the  punishment  inflicted  is</span><span>  more  home-work.  For  an  hour's</span></p> <p><span>  romping  with  companions  the  wearied</span><span>  one  has  perhaps  to  sit  up,  after</span><span>  all  the  house  has  gone  to  rest,</span><span>  writing  out  an  array  of  meaningless</span><span>  sentences.  Some  of  the  penalties  im-</span><span>  posed  by  teachers  in  this  way,  we  are</span><span>  charitable  enough  to  suppose,  are  in-</span><span>  flicted  without  thought  ;  otherwise  they</span><span>  would  display  an  absence  of  a  knowledge</span><span>  of  human  nature,  and  almost  inhuman</span><span>  cruelty,  highly  reprehensible.  Besides,</span><span>  when  the  time  of  children  is  engrossed</span><span>  by  home-lessons  they  are  deprived  of</span><span>  that  moral  and  social  education,  which,</span><span>  silently  and  unobtrusively,  it  may  be,  is</span><span>  always  going  on  in  every  family.  It</span><span>  is  of  great  importance  that  children</span><span>  should  be  courteous,  kindly,  affectionate,</span><span>  loving,  and  forgiving  to  each  other  :  that</span><span>  they  should  honour,  reverence,  and  love</span><span>  their  parents  ;  that  they  should  be</span><span>  hospitable,  attentive,  and  well-bred  to</span><span>  strangers  :  but  how  or  when  arc  tiley  to</span><span>  be  gently  and  easily  taught  the  duties  of</span><span>  demeanour,  if  their  time  is  to  be  always</span><span>  taken  up,  their  attention  engaged,</span><span>  and  their  tempers  broken  and  made</span><span>  irritable  by  a  haunting,  horrible  sense</span><span>  of  irksome  tasks  to  be  performed.  Fine</span><span>  manners  without  learning  should  be</span><span>  avoided,  and,  on  the  other  hand,  so</span><span>  also  should  learned  impudence  and</span></p> <p><span>  boorishness.</span></p> <p><span>  We  have  made  these  remarks  without</span><span>  intending  they  shonld  have  any  local</span><span>  point  or  application  :  if  they  have  the</span><span>  fault  is  not  ours.  Tile  subject,  however,</span><span>  has  attracted  attention,  and  is  exciting</span><span>  considerable  discussion  in  Victoria  at</span><span>  present.  Commenting  on  it  the  Mel-</span><span>  bourne  Argus  says:-""Things  have  now</span><span>  come  to  this  point-parents  must</span></p> <p><span>  either  assert  themselves  or  endure</span><span>  in  silence.""  We  are  most  desirous</span><span>  that  in  connection  with  our  educa-</span><span>  tional  institutions  there  should  be  no</span><span>  call  for  parental  assertion.  That  such</span><span>  an  unpleasant  necessity  may  be  avoided</span><span>  rests  with  the  School  Trustees,  who</span><span>  sanction  the  curriculum,  and  the  teachers</span><span>  who  have  to  act  in  accordance  with  it.</span><span>  It  is  for  the  public,  however,  to  observe</span><span>  what  is  going  on  elsewhere  ;  to  remem-</span><span>  ber  that  teachers  form  an  influential</span></p> <p><span>  class  iu  the  community  :  and  that  there</span><span>  is  a  growing  disposition  to  shift  a  large</span><span>  portion  of  the  work  of  teaching  from  thc</span><span>  school-room  to  the  family  parlour.</span></p> <p><span>  Tire  southern  papers  contain  details  of</span><span>  several  colil  blooded  murders  which  have  been</span><span>  committed  in  Tasmania.  Tiley  are  intercstiug</span><span>  because  they  seem  to  illustrate  the  fearful</span><span>  depravity  into  which  the  larrikins  of  that</span><span>  colony  have  fallen,  and  thc  dangerous  class</span><span>  that  is  growing  up  among  us.  A  workman  on</span><span>  thc  Tasmanian  main  lino,  who  dwelt  in  a  cot</span><span>  tage  with  his  wife,  four  childron,  and  a</span><span>  lodger  named  Mrs.  Boram,  retired  to  rest</span><span>  about  ten  o'clock  on  Monday,  the  9th  instant.</span><span>  The  family  were  aroused  by  large  stones  being</span><span>  hurled  on  the  roof,  and  WÍIBOU  went  to  the</span><span>  door  to  learn  thc  cause  of  tho  disturbance.</span><span>  Immediately  bis  wifo  heard  a  shot,</span><span>  and  he  returned  crying  ""  My  God,</span><span>  wife  I  am  shot.""  He  staggered  and</span><span>  felt  dead.  Two  men  then  appeared,  and</span><span>  demanded  admittance,  or  they  would  hurn  the</span><span>  house  down.  Ât  once  they  set  about  carrying</span><span>  out  their  threat.  They  gathered  dry  sticks</span><span>  about  it,  and  set  fire  to  thc  house  in  three</span><span>  places.  Tho  poor  woman  and  children  were</span><span>  driven  out  by  thc  flames.  Thc  ruffians  took</span><span>  nil  thc  punr  woman's  money,  threatened  her</span><span>  daughter  because  ehe  knew'  «ne  of  them,  aud</span><span>  fired  at  and  wounded  thc  lodger.  Neighbours</span><span>  whose  aid  was  Boiiçht  refused  to  render  any</span></p> <p><span>  assistance.  Thc  house  and  its  coutents  were</span><span>  completely  consumed  ;  the  woman  and  children</span><span>  were  left  in  their  nijjht  clothes  ;  and  tho  men</span><span>  got  clear  off.  On  the  Wednesday  following,</span><span>  the  police  who  were  on  thc  search  for  the</span><span>  murderers,  heard  of  a  man  being  seen</span><span>  lying  on  the  road  Bide  near  lapping  Forest.</span><span>  On  foina  thither  tiley  found  a  mun</span><span>  named  Alf.  Hulmán,  driver  of  a  lemonade</span><span>  cart.  lying  at  the  point  of  death  in  the  scrub,</span><span>  He  bad  been  shot  without  any  warning,  when</span><span>  driving  along  the  road.  Following  the  track</span><span>  of  thc  cart,  which  bad  been  taken  through  a</span><span>  slip-panel,  the  police  came  on  the  two  men</span><span>  they  were  in  search  nf,  regaling  themselves</span><span>  willi  lemonade.  Tiley  ran,  but  when  the</span><span>  police  fired  over  their  heads  they  quietly</span><span>  surrendered.  They  were  nt  once  taken  to</span><span>  Campbeltown,  and  placed  in  the  lock-up.  It</span><span>  is  not  to  be  wondered  at  that  they  were  in</span></p> <p><span>  dangar  of  being  lynched  by  the  way.  They</span><span>  were  fouud  to  be  toe  culprit«  in  both  murders,</span><span>  and  are  two  young,men  named  Mahoney,  alias</span><span>  Sullivan,  191  and  'Ogden,  20.  Having  been</span><span>  badly  brought  up,  they  acquired  no  trade  or</span><span>  steady  mcausof  livelihood,  and  loafed  abuutlow</span><span>  public  houses  in  Launoestoo.  Their  victims</span><span>  were  quiet  well-doing  industrious  men,  with</span><span>  wives  and  families.  Mow  the  serious  aspect</span><span>  of  the  cases  is  that  the  perpetrators  of  these</span><span>  cold-blooded  murders  had  no  motive  for  them,</span><span>  and  their  utterances  since  show  a  most  heart-</span><span>  less  levity.  They  evince  not  the  slightest</span><span>  desire  to  justify  their  conduct,  and  glory  in</span><span>  their  crime,  as  if  it  were  something  to  bs</span><span>  proud  of.  Who  will  be  ablo  to  feel  safe  if  mon</span><span>  of  this  type  increase  among  as.  The  very</span><span>  thought  of  such  a  tbiug  creates  a  feeling  of</span><span>  uneasiness,  and  cases  of  this  kind  show  that</span><span>  as  a  matter  of  self-protection  larrikinism  must</span><span>  be  put  down.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  have  been  asked  to  call  the  attention</span><span>  of  our  scavengers  to  two  odorous  pools  of  water</span><span>  near  tho  side  walk  between  Mr.  Iogham'a  shop</span><span>  and  that  of  Mr.  W.

They  were</span><span>  kept  there  for  about  an  hour,  until  an  order</span><span>  was  procured  from  Dr.  Harricks  for  their</span><span>  admission  into  the  Hospital,  whither  they</span><span>  were  driven  in  a  cab  at  about  half-past  one  in</span><span>  the  morning.</span></p> <p><span>  A  TRAVELLER  from  Townsville  informs  us</span></p> <p><span>  that  many  persons  were  disappointed  at  not</span><span>  obtaining  passages  by  the  Quiraing,  s.s.,  for</span><span>  Rockhampton.  The  Townsville  agents  of  the</span><span>  A,S.N.  Company  declined  to  grant  tickets</span><span>  to  those,  especially  commercial  travellers,  who</span><span>  were  burdened  with  a  large  amount  of  luggage,</span><span>  as  they  could  not  undertake  its  delivery  in</span><span>  Rockhampton.  The  inconvenience  thus  caused</span><span>  to  travellers  is  due  to  the  fact  that  since  thc</span><span>  Bunyip  was  disabled  the  A.S.N.  Company</span><span>  have  taken  no  steps  to  place  a  steamer  in  the</span><span>  river  cmnmcusurate  with  thu  increasing  trade</span><span>  with  this  port  The  Mabel  was  chartered  to</span><span>  run  the  contract  mails  for  the  company  after</span><span>  the  Fitzroy  was  Jaid  up,  and  as  her  cargo</span><span>  carrying  capacity  is  of  a  limited  naturo  the</span><span>  coast  agents  wisely  decline  to  grant  tickets</span><span>  to  this  port  for  anyone  with  a  large  amount  of</span><span>  luggage.  Consequently  the  commercial  tra-</span></p> <p><span>  vellers  whose  business  necessitates  a  visit</span><span>  herc  will  have  to  call  in  at  Mackay  aud  there</span><span>  await  a  boat  for  this  port.</span></p> <p><span>  A  CRICKET  match  was  played  at  North</span><span>  Rockhampton  yesterday  afternoon  between</span><span>  scratch  teams  under  the  captaincy  of  Messrs.</span><span>  Fisher  and  Geo.

He  went</span><span>  to  her  residenoe,  next  the  Royal  Exchange</span><span>  Hotel,  just  before  four  o'clock  yesterday</span><span>  afternoon,  whoo  she  asked  bim  ns  usual  to</span><span>  cut  some  wood.  As  ho  did  not  wish  to  do  thc</span><span>  work  just  then,  but  wanted  to  have  a</span><span>  ""spell,""  when  asked  to  cut  the  wood  he  took</span><span>  bold  of  tho  axe,  and  without  saying  a  word</span><span>  struck  her  in  the  ribs.  She  fell  to  the</span><span>  ground,  and  the  brute  then  commenced  to  kick</span><span>  her.  Luckily  for  tho  poor  old  woman  her</span><span>  granddaughter  happened  to  be  at  homo,  who</span><span>  seeing  what  took  place,  at  once  screamed  for</span><span>  help.  Two  young  men  who  were  passing  at</span><span>  the  time  came  to  her  assistance,  and  the</span><span>  kanaka  observing  them,  desisted  his  attack,</span><span>  dropped  the  axe,  and  cleared  over  the  fence  of</span><span>  the  next  yard,  from  whence  he  got  into  the</span><span>  street.  Hero  he  was  pursued  by  a  largo</span><span>  number  of  people  who  had  by  this  time  col-</span></p> <p><span>  lected.  Ho  went  in  the  direction  of  tho  Church</span></p> <p><span>  of  England,  and  from  there  he  was  fol-</span><span>  lowed  by  a  man  in  a  lorry  to  near  the</span><span>  Victoria  Jlotel,  where  he  was  captured  by</span><span>  tho  man,  assisted  by  the  police,  aud  brought</span><span>  in  the  lorry  to  the  lockup.  Tho  woman  has</span><span>  been  examined  by  Dre.  Poland  and  Harricks,</span><span>  who  found  that  her  right  side  was  bruised,</span><span>  and  one  of  her  ribs  splintered,  but  so  far</span><span>  as  they  can  ascertain  no  bones  have  been</span><span>  broken.  There  is  also  a  slight  cut  in  the</span><span>  middle  forefinger  of  the  left  hand,  and  two</span><span>  small  cuti  on  thc  back  of  thc  elbow  of  the</span><span>  left  arm.  AB  the  woman  is  of  such  a  great  age</span><span>  there  is  no  knowing  what  may  be  the  conse-</span><span>  quences.  Urs,  Firth  is  one  of  the  oldest</span><span>  residents  in  Âlma-strect,  having  lived  there</span><span>  siuce  1830,  and  at  one  time  she  kept  the  Alma</span><span>  boarding-house.</span></p> <p><span>  A  QUAND  concert  of  sacred  and  secular  music</span><span>  was  given  by  the  members  of  the  choir  of  St.</span><span>  Joseph's  Church,  in  tho  Hibernian  Hall  last</span><span>  night.  Thc  attendance  was  not  so  largo  as</span><span>  was  anticipated,  seeing  that  we  have  had  very</span><span>  few  public  entertainments  recently.  Those</span><span>  who  have  the  good  taste  to  patronise  the</span><span>  concerts  given  by  St.  Joseph  s  Choir  are</span><span>  always  certain  to  bear  good  music  rendered  in</span><span>  effective  style.  Tho  auditors  last  night  were</span><span>  not  disappointed  in  that  respect,  as  the</span><span>  selections  of  muBic  were  choice  and  varied,</span><span>  and  they  were  faithfully  and  tastefully</span><span>  rendered.  In  tho  singing  of  tho  sacred</span><span>  pieces  tho  expression  was  clear  and  distinct,</span><span>  tho  notes  of  joy  being  full  and  sweet,  and</span><span>  those  of  confidence  and  hope,  melting  in  their</span><span>  tenderness.  The  choir  was  not  so  strong  os</span><span>  usual,  but  on  this  account  tho  balance  of  parts</span><span>  and  harmony  of  voices  were  all  the  more  per-</span><span>  fect.  The  opening  piece  was  Haydn's</span><span>  ""Credo  ""  chorus,  and  was  followed  hy  the  solo</span><span>  ""  PaniB  Angelicus,""  which  MÍBB  Coffey  ren-</span><span>  dered  with  her  accustomed  taste  and  skill.  Mr.</span><span>  Rredfeldt,  who  lias  a  fine  clear  tenor  voice,</span><span>  sang  the  solo  of  ""  Laúdate,""  and  the  choir</span><span>  came  at  the  chorus  with  excellent  effect.</span><span>  In  thc  suiting  of  ""  Ave  Maria,""  ""  Regina</span><span>  Codi,""  ""  Pro  pecatis,""  and  ""Tantum  ergo""</span><span>  much  taste  and  feeling  were  manifested,  as</span><span>  well  as  the  results  of  careful  study  and</span><span>  practice.  The  secular  part  of  the  concert  was</span><span>  opened  with  a  lively  set  of  Irish  Quadrilles,</span><span>  played  by  four  young  1  dies  on  two  pianos.</span><span>  Mr.  Gerahty's  song,  ""The  Little  Hero,""  was</span><span>  heartily  encored  ;  and  Messrs.  M'Mullan  and</span><span>  do  Schilstel  were  loudly  applauded  for  their</span><span>  fine  rendering  of  the  ""Sailor  Sighs.""  The  choir</span><span>  bas  recently  received  a  notable  accession</span><span>  in  Mrs.  Cripps,  who  haBa  magnificent  soprano</span><span>  voice,  which  she  has  cultivated  and  exercises</span><span>  with  fine  taste  and  skill.  She  sang  ""Golden</span><span>  Love  ""  witli  great  sweetness,  and,  on  bciug</span><span>  recalled,  drew  down  thc  house  by  lier  charm-</span><span>  in!;  rendering  of  ""We'd  better  bide  a  wee.""</span><span>  Thc  audience  were  not  content  till  she  repeated</span><span>  a  verse  of  it.  Mr.  Milford  gave  creat  pleasure</span><span>  by  his  happy  and  sprightly  rendering  nf  thc</span><span>  motto  song,  ""  Second  thoughts  are  best,""  and</span><span>  ""Over  the  garden  wall  ""  Miss  Morrin,  a  woe</span><span>  performer  not  much  higher  than  the  piano</span><span>  stool,  played  a  selection  from  ""  Lucrczia</span><span>  Borgia""  with  wonderful  exactness  and</span><span>  manipulative  ability.  Other  selections  fol-</span><span>  lowed,  and  an  excellent  concert  was  concluded</span><span>  by  a  fine  march  played  on  tho  harmonium  and</span><span>  piano.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY.  JUNE  21,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  ""  DEFENCE,  not  defiance  ""  is  the  motto</span><span>  of  the  Volunteers,  and  it  seems  to  be</span><span>  one  peculiarly  adapted  to  colonial  rail-</span><span>  way  policy.  Our  leading  men  are  more</span><span>  fully  recognising  the  fact,  that  the  care-</span><span>  ful  development  of  the  railway  systems</span><span>  of  Australia,  is  desirable  for  the  pros-</span><span>  perity  of  the  colonies,  individually  and</span><span>  collectively.  By  pushing  out  lines  (rom</span><span>  the  great  centres  of  commerce  and</span><span>  trade,  it  is  felt  that  the  latter  may  be</span><span>  increased  and  extended,  with  advantage</span><span>  to  the  State  immediately  interested,  and</span><span>  also  to  others  brought  into  communica-</span><span>  tion  with  it.  Railway  extension,  it  has</span><span>  been  argued,  will  hasten  the  time  when</span><span>  the  communities  of  Australia  will  be</span></p> <p><span>  united  in  one  grand  confederacy  ;  but,</span><span>  though  anxious  to  promote  such  a  con-</span><span>  summation,  politicians,  in  the  meantime,</span><span>  direct  their  efforts  to  make  their  railway</span><span>  policy  contribute  to  the  welfare  each  of</span><span>  their  own  colonies.  On  the  9th  instant</span><span>  the  Great  Western  Railway  of  New  South</span><span>  Wales  was  opened  at  Nyngan,  and  the</span><span>  proceeding  was  made  the  occasion  for</span><span>  some  speechifying.  Sir  Patrick  Jennings,</span><span>  vice-President  of  the  Executive  Council,</span><span>  in  reply  to  an  address  presented  to  him</span><span>  by  the  inhabitants  of  Nyngan,  made  a</span><span>  short  speech,  which  is  noticeable  for  its</span><span>  suggestions,  and  for  the  clear  light  it</span><span>  throws  on  the  railway  policy  of  the</span><span>  sister  colony.  He  laid  it  down  as  an</span><span>  axiom,  the  truth  of  which  all  would  ad-</span><span>  mit,  ""  that  nothing  the  Government  could</span><span>  do  tended  so  much  to  open  up  the</span><span>  country,  for  the  beneficial  occupation  of</span><span>  all  classes  bf  the  colonists,  as  the  exten-</span><span>  sion  of  railways  into  the  heart  of-  the</span><span>  country,  thus  giving  facilities  to  transit,</span><span>  that  would  eventually  lead  to  the  country</span><span>  being  populated  and  rendered  in  every</span><span>  way  beneficial.""  From  this  it  will  be</span><span>  seen  that  the  speaker  is  not  an  advocate</span><span>  of  merely  political  railways-lines  made</span><span>  to  gratify  the  clamourous  demands  of</span><span>  the  residents  in  some  particular  district.</span><span>  He  does  not  believe  in  waiting  till  there</span><span>  are  people  to  cry  out  for  railway  exten</span><span>  tension  ;  but  he  would  push  out  lines</span><span>  wherever  people  should  bc  settled  and</span><span>  trade  created,  and  thus  make  railways  the</span><span>  pioneers  of  progress.  His  conduct  in</span><span>  this  respect  contrasts  with  that  of  some</span><span>  of  our  politicians,  who  make  it  an</span><span>  objection  to  some  railway  extensions</span><span>  ""  that  nobody  ever  asked  for  them.""  It</span><span>  must  be  plain,  if  the  policy  of  the  latter</span><span>  is  to  prevail  among  us,  that  we  will</span><span>  presently  have  a  net-work  of  lines  in  the</span><span>  districts  near  Brisbane  ;  population  will</span><span>  be  massed  and  starved  there  ;  and  our</span><span>  fine  outside  country  will  continue  in  the</span><span>  possession  of  the  squatter  and  his  flocks.</span></p> <p><span>  Sir  Patrick  Jennings  rejoices  in  the</span><span>  prospect  of  New  South  Wales  and</span><span>  Victoria  shaking  hands,  ""  bound  by  an</span><span>  iron  chain  across  the  Murray.""  He</span></p> <p><span>  considers  it  will  be  for  the  advan-</span><span>  tage  of  the  two  great  centres  to</span><span>  be  connected  in  that  way  ;  and  is  not</span><span>  troubled,  seemingly,  by  jealous  fears  lest</span><span>  the  one  colony  should  exercise  an  undue</span><span>  influence  on  the  trade  of  the  other,</span><span>  when  the  -highways  between  them  are</span><span>  free  of  obstacles.  His  belief  seemingly</span><span>  is  that  the  greater  the  facilities  for  inter-</span><span>  course  between  the  colonies,  the  more</span><span>  rapidly  will  their  prosperity  be  advanced,</span><span>  and  the  happiness  of  the  people  in-</span><span>  creased.  He  is  not  ready,  however,  to</span><span>  let  the  adjoining  colonies  steal  the  traffic</span><span>  which  naturally  belongs  to  his  own  ;  and</span><span>  so  he  contemplates  the  extension  of  the</span><span>  New  South  Wales  railways  to  the  Queens-</span><span>  land  border  at  Stanthorpe  and  Bnrringun.</span><span>  It  will  be  seen  that  the  defensive  policy</span></p> <p><span>  he  advocates  is  to  counteract  the  in-</span></p> <p><span>  fluence  of  Queensland  railways.  Bar-</span><span>  ringun  is  in  the  Warrego  district,  and  the</span><span>  trade  of  it  will  be  secured  to  New  South</span><span>  Wales,  if  Sir  P.  Jennings'  plans  are</span><span>  acted  upon.  ""As  the  Queensland</span><span>  Government""  he  says  ""had  encouraged</span><span>  a  land-grant  railway  system  down  the</span><span>  Warrego  to  the  border  of  New  South</span><span>  Wales,  it  would  be  our  duty,  in  order  to</span><span>  secure  our  share  of  the  traffic,  to  extend</span><span>  our  Great  Western  Railway  system  to  its</span><span>  extreme  limits.""  It  will  thus  be  seen</span><span>  that  while  desirous  of  shaking  hands</span></p> <p><span>  with  sister  colonies,  Sir  Patrick  Jen-'</span><span>  ninçs  is  determined  they  shall  not</span><span>  lay  their  fingers  on  trade  he  thinks  does</span><span>  not  belong  to  them.  While  watchful  of</span><span>  the  approaches  of  Queensland  on  the</span><span>  north,  Sir  Patrick  Jennings  would</span></p> <p><span>  also  have  the  people  of  Neiv  South</span><span>  Wales  meet  the  approaches  of  South</span><span>  Australia,  which  is  stretching  out  her</span><span>  railway  system  to  Mount  lirovvn.  ""  It</span><span>  would  be  the  duty  of  the  Government  to</span><span>  connect  that  distant  part  of  the  colony</span><span>  with  the  proposed  railway  to  Wilcannia.""</span></p> <p><span>  The  railway  policy  advocated  by  Sir</span><span>  Patrick  Jennings,  it'  will  bc  seen,  differs</span><span>  in  its  essential  features  from  that  which</span><span>  appears  to  find  favour  with  a  consider-</span><span>  able  number  of  people  in  this  colony.</span><span>  Should  our  Government  give  effect  to</span><span>  the  latter,  our  main  lines  will  be  carried</span><span>  out  into  the  back  country,  and  while</span><span>  they  may  be  highly  useful  in  promoting</span><span>  settlement,  they  will  not  be  effective  in</span><span>  protecting  our  trade  from  the  growing</span></p> <p><span>  influence  of  South  Australia  on  the</span><span>  West,  and  of  New  South  Wales  on  the</span><span>  South.  When  we  glance  at  the  maps  of</span><span>  the  sister  colonies,  we  see  that  the</span><span>  number  of  what  we  may  suppose  to  be</span><span>  political  railways  is  small.  The  lines</span></p> <p><span>  in  New  South  Wales  and  Victoria</span><span>  irradiate  from  the  principle  ports</span><span>  Sydney  and  Melbourne-towards  the</span><span>  borders  of  the  colony  ;  and  in  South  Aus-</span></p> <p><span>  tralia  the  main  line  runs  north  from</span><span>  Adelaide,  with  branches  to  the  ports  in</span><span>  Spencer  Gulf.  In  the  latter  colony  we</span><span>  find  short  lines  of  only  local  importance,</span><span>  but  the  policy  of  constructing  these  has'</span><span>  been  abandoned  by  the  present  Adminis-</span><span>  tration,  which  is  projecting  intercolonial</span><span>  lines  towards  Victoria,  New  South</span><span>  Wales,  and  along  the  Queensland  border</span><span>  to  the  Northern  Territory.  That  our</span><span>  present  Government  have  adopted  a</span><span>  bold  and  strategic  railway  policy  for</span><span>  Queensland  we  have  argued  repeatedly,</span><span>  and  it  is  not  without  considerable  ap-</span><span>  prehension  we  look  forward  to  that</span><span>  which  may  bs  adopted  by  their  suc-</span><span>  cessors.  The  danger  is  that,  while  we</span><span>  go  on  making  railways  near  our  towns,</span></p> <p><span>  the  trade  of  our  border  districts  will  be</span></p> <p><span>  appropriated  by  our  neighbours.</span></p> <p><span>  A  MOD  of  260  fata,  from  Mr.  W.

KOCH,  who  was  lately  in  the  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  branch  of  the  Queensland  National</span><span>  Bank  and  went  to  the  Blackall  branch,</span><span>  writeB  under  date  15th  June  to  Mr.  James</span><span>  Mackenzie,  P.C.  Secretary  of  the  Rockhamp-</span><span>  ton  District,  respecting  the  revival  of  the</span><span>  Oddfellows'  Lodge  at  Blackall.  The  lodge</span><span>  '  there  is  named  thc  Loyal  Barcoo  Lodge,</span><span>  No.  10,  of  the  Mauoliester  Cinty,  and  the</span><span>  business  in  connection  with  the  lodge  has  been</span><span>  in  a  dormant  state  for  some  time,  owing  to</span><span>  the  want  of  energy  displayed  by  some  of</span><span>  the  members.  Mr.  Koch  opened  the  lodge  in</span><span>  the  Court  House  on  the  13th  instant.  In  this</span><span>  ho  woo  assisted  by'  Bro.  Wedgewood,  of</span><span>  Queanbeyan,  N.  8.  Wales,  aud  nineteen</span><span>  working  or  full  benefit  members  and  four</span><span>  honorary  members  were  initiated,  and  the  fees</span><span>  received  amounted  to  £28.  Mr.  Koch  gave  a</span><span>  short  address,  and  pointed  out  the  necessity  of</span><span>  exercising  due  care  in  the  election  of  the  first</span><span>  officers.  The  nominations  resulted  ia  the</span><span>  appointment  of  Bro.  C.  W.  Sargeant  as  N.G.:</span><span>  Bro.  R.  WV  Miller,  Y.G.;  Bro.  C.  J.  James,</span><span>  E.S.;  Bro.  R.  M.  Harvey,  Financial  Secre-</span><span>  tary  ;  and  Bro.  T.  H.  Slater,  junr.,  Treasurer.</span><span>  The  installation  took  place  shortly  after  the</span><span>  election.  Other  mattera  in  connection  with</span><span>  lodge  business  were  transacted,  and  from  the</span><span>  tenor  of  Mr.  Koch's  communication  it  is</span><span>  evident  the  order  of  Oddfellows  ÍB  likely  to</span><span>  flourish  in  the  Blackall  township.  A  good</span><span>  start  has  been  made,  and  it  only  rests  with</span><span>  the  officers  of  the  Loyal  Barcoo  Lodge  to  make</span><span>  the  far  western  branch  a  snccess.</span></p> <p><span>  _.  IT  is  with  very  considerable  satisfaction  we</span></p> <p><span>  have  to  announce  that  the  whole  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  capital  of  tho  Yeppoon  Sugar  Company  has</span><span>  now  been  subscribed.  The  remaining  shares</span><span>  were  taken  up  yesterday.  This  shows  an</span><span>  amount  of  coufidence  in  the  sngar  industry  of</span><span>  this  district,  which  is  most  cheering.  It</span><span>  was  on  the  6th  of  February  last,  that  a</span><span>  preliminary  meeting  was  held  in  the  Criterion</span><span>  Hotel,  at  which  the  proposal  to  form  such  a</span><span>  company  was  discussed.  A  week  later  pro-</span><span>  visional  directors  were  appointed  and  a</span><span>  prospectus  issued.  About  a  month  ago  it  was</span><span>  resolved  to  float  the  company,  and  now  the</span><span>  full  amount  of  capital  required  has  been  sub</span><span>  scribed.  The  capital  is  £20,000  in  4000  shares</span><span>  of  £5  each.  Of  these  3600  have  been  sucscribed</span></p> <p><span>  for  by  the  public,  and  the  remaining  400</span><span>  allocated  to  Mr.  Broome,  Woodlands,  in  part</span><span>  Ïiaymcnt  of  the  1000  acres  of  land  which  is  to</span></p> <p><span>  orm  the  plantation.  A  meeting  of  the</span><span>  Directors  was  held  yesterday,  at  which  the</span><span>  pleasant  prospects  of  the  Company  formed  tho</span><span>  theme  of  congratulation.  It  was  resolved  to</span><span>  have  the  survey  of  the  plantation  ground  at</span><span>  onoe  completed,  and  to  advertise  for  a</span><span>  manager  capable  of  forming  the  plantation,</span><span>  and  attending  to  all  the  details  of  breaking</span><span>  up  and  planting  out  the  ground;  erecting</span><span>  machinery;  and  carrying  on  the  work.  The</span><span>  prospectus  contemplated  the  erection  of</span><span>  machinery,  capable  of  manufacturing  one</span><span>  thousand  tons  of  sugar  in  the  season,  and  as</span><span>  soon  as  the  manager  is  appointed,  it  will  no</span><span>  doubt  be  ordered,  so  as  to  be  in  readiness  for</span><span>  crushing  operations  this  time  next  year.  Tho</span><span>  directors  and  the  community  are  to  be  con</span><span>  fratulatud  on  the  great  start  that  has  thus</span></p> <p><span>  eeo  given  to  the  sugar  industry  in  the</span><span>  Central  Distriot.  }</span></p> <p><span>  THE  annual  tea  meeting  of  the  Gracemere</span><span>  Protestant  Church  was  held  last  evening,  when</span><span>  a  large  number  sat  down  to  partake  of  the</span><span>  abundant  and  varied  supplies  provided  by  the</span><span>  ladies  of  the  congregation.  At  the  publio</span><span>  meeting  aftea  tea,  the  Rev.  T.  W.  I'Erson</span><span>  presided-'  '  All  hail  tho  power  of  Jesus</span><span>  name  ""  was  sung,  when  the  Rev,  T.  Jones</span><span>  offered  prayer.  The  Chairman  called  on  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Watson,  in  the  absence  of  Mr.  Risien,  to</span><span>  present  the  report.  Ho  complained  of  not</span><span>  being  able  to  get  a  special  train  for  less  than</span><span>  £10.  The  remaining  debt  on  thc  building</span><span>  is  £16,  and  a  hope  was  expressed  that  the</span><span>  proceeds  of  this  anniversary  would  extinguish</span><span>  it.  The  Chairman  contrasted  the  present</span><span>  favourable  state  of  things  connected  with</span><span>  Gracemere  Protestant  Churoh  since  he  first</span><span>  knew  it.  The  Rev.  G.  Slade  dwelt  upen  the</span><span>  varied  mercies  of  God,  the  satisfying  character</span><span>  of  godliness,  and  the  happiness  and  joy  which</span><span>  it  will  surely  produce  in  its  possessors.</span><span>  Mr.  W.  Davis  spoke  of  the  religious</span><span>  advantages  of  dwelling  in  the  ""  bush.""</span><span>  The  bushmen  of  old  times  had  religious  enter-</span><span>  tainments,  as  they  held  communion  with  God</span><span>  and  his  angels.  Mr.  Redstone  gave  a  reading</span><span>  very  effectively.  Mr.  T.  Jones  urged  a  realisa-</span><span>  tion  of  the  great  end  of  life,  and  the  impor-</span><span>  tance  sincerely,  earnestly,  and  believiugly</span><span>  of  each  ono  working  out  tho  pur-</span><span>  pose  of  God  in  our  .  history.  Rev.</span><span>  D.  Mossop  gave  a  very  interesting  chapter</span><span>  in  his  early  missionary  life,  illustrating</span><span>  the  principle  that  godliness  is  profitable  to  all</span><span>  things,  having  promise  of  the  life  that  now  is,</span></p> <p><span>  and  that  which  is  to  come,  and  that  ho  that</span><span>  soweth  bountifully  shall  also  reap  bountifully.</span><span>  Kev.  R.  Hartley  dwelt  on  the  advantages  of</span><span>  public  worship.  Several  appropriate  sacred</span><span>  songs  were  sung  at  intervale.

"<p><span>  KOCKIIAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  SEPTEMBER  ll,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THAT  is  a  very  good  custom  which  they</span><span>  retain  in  Victoria,  but  have  departed</span><span>  from  in  this  colony-for  what  reason  we</span></p> <p><span>  have  never  been  able  to  discover-of</span><span>  putting  descriptive  preamble  to  Bills  in</span><span>  Parliament.  The  preamble,  when  well</span><span>  drawn,  sets  forth  clearly  the  aim  and</span><span>  purpose  of  the  measure  with  which  it  is</span><span>  connected,  so  that  before  starting  lo</span><span>  consider  a  Statute,  the  student  has  a  f.iir</span><span>  idea  of  thc  ends  sought  to  be  accom-</span><span>  plished  by  it.  This  appears  from  thc</span><span>  preamble  of  a  Hill,  upon  the  introduc-</span><span>  tion  of  which  the  Premier  of  Victorialately</span><span>  made  a  great  speech.  The  preamble  in</span><span>  question  recites  that  ""  it  is  desirable  to</span><span>  repeal  the  present  Civil  Service  Act,  and</span><span>  make  belter  provisions,  which  will  apply</span><span>  to  and  include  all  departments  of  the</span><span>  public  service,  not  heretofore  provided</span><span>  for  by  any  act  of  Parliament,  and  it  is</span></p> <p><span>  expedient  and  highly  desirable  to  abolish</span><span>  patronage  in  appointments  and  promo-</span><span>  tions,  and  cstalish  a  just  and  equitable</span><span>  system,  which  will  enable  all  persons,</span><span>  who  have  qualified  themselves  in  that</span><span>  behalf,  to  enter  the  public  service</span><span>  without  favour  or  recommendation,  other</span><span>  than  their  own  merits  and  fitness  for  the</span><span>  position.""  From  these  few  sentences</span><span>  we  learn  that  patronage  in  the  appoint-</span><span>  ments  and  promotions  lo  the  public</span><span>  service,  under  the  old  system,  have  been</span><span>  inequitable  and  unjust  ;  and  that  this</span><span>  measure  has  been  framed  to  put</span><span>  an  end  to  nepotism  and  favourit-</span><span>  ism  for  the  future.  To  learn  how</span><span>  far  the  old  system  has  been  iniquitous</span><span>  we  must  refer  to  the  speech  of  the  hon.</span><span>  gentleman  who  introduced  the  measure,</span><span>  and  it  furnishes  us  with  evidence  of  a</span><span>  very  important  character  upon  the</span><span>  subject.  For  thirty  years  Mr.  Service</span><span>  has  been  closely  connected  with  the</span><span>  commercial  interests  of  Victoria,  and  an</span><span>  observer  of  what  was  going  on  in  the</span><span>  public  service.  Now  he  comes  forward</span><span>  and  tells  the  Assembly  that  the  condi-</span><span>  tion  of  things  in  it  has  become</span></p> <p><span>  such  as  cannot  be  described  otherwise</span></p> <p><span>  than  by  the  word  ""deplorable.""  In</span><span>  portraying  the  manner  in  which  it  has</span><span>  arisen,  the  hon.  gentleman  does  not</span><span>  seem  to  have  taken  sufficient  account  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  state  of  education  and  circumstances</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  colony.  The  demoralisation</span></p> <p><span>  which  has  arisen  he  attributes  to  the</span><span>  introduction  and  retention  of  men  in  all</span><span>  branches  of  the  Civil  Service  without</span></p> <p><span>  their  passing  through  the  lower  grades  ;</span><span>  and  to  political  patronage  lifting  men</span><span>  ""over  the  garden  wall""  into  the</span><span>  pleasant  shades  of  the  public  preserve.</span><span>  It  was  because  the  upper  classes  in</span><span>  the  United  Kingdom  were  crowding  the</span><span>  public  service  with  younger  sons,  and</span><span>  making  it  costly  and  ineffective,  that  the</span><span>  system  of  competitive  examinations  was</span></p> <p><span>  introduced  there.  Besides,  there  was  no  :</span><span>  excuse  for  the  conservative  arrangement,</span><span>  because  there  were  always  plenty  of</span><span>  competent  servants  available.  Twenty</span><span>  years  ago  that  was  not  the  case  in  Vic</span><span>  toria,  any  more  than  it  is  in  Queensland</span></p> <p><span>  now.  We  have  had  neither  time  nor</span></p> <p><span>  opportunity  to  create  or  cultivate  a  large</span><span>  supply  of  well-qualified  civil  servants,</span><span>  especially  for  the  higher  branches  of  the</span><span>  service.  Hence  the  administrators  and</span><span>  heads  of  departments  have  been  glad  to  get</span><span>  good  men,  though  they  did  not  come  up</span></p> <p><span>  the  ladder  of  successive  promotion.  In</span><span>  Victoria  things  have  now  altered  with</span><span>  the  lapse  of  time  and  increase  of  edu-</span><span>  cational  facilities.  Candidates  for  em-</span><span>  ployment  are  numerous  and  competent,</span><span>  and,  having  a  choice,  it  is  clearly  the  duty</span><span>  of  the  Government  to  make  provision</span><span>  for  the  best  men  being  chosen.  Our</span><span>  educational  system  is  producing  intelli-</span><span>  gent  well-informed  citizens,  our  popula-</span><span>  tion  is  increasing  rapidly,  and  the  time</span><span>  will  come  presently,  when  there  will  no</span><span>  longer  be  an  excuse  for  patronage  in  this</span></p> <p><span>  colony.</span></p> <p><span>  The  civil  service  reforms  it  is  proposed</span><span>  to  carry  out  in  Victoria  will  commend</span><span>  the  measure  making  provisions  for  them</span><span>  to  all  intelligent  colonists.  A  sudden</span><span>  revolution  is  not  to  be  effected.

A  classification  is  to  be</span><span>  made  of  all  the  work  done  in  the  various</span><span>  departments  of  the  public  service,  and</span><span>  thc  employees  are  to  be  graded  and  paid</span><span>  accordingly.  If  it  is  found,  for  instance,</span><span>  that  a  person  is  drawing  a  salary</span><span>  associated  with  a  certain  rank  in  the</span><span>  service,  he  must  do  the  work  of  that</span><span>  grade  :  if  he  is  found  to  be  incompetent,</span><span>  then  he  must  be  content  to  occupy  a</span><span>  lower  position,  or  leave  the  service.  In</span><span>  this  way  inefficient  place-holders,  who</span><span>  have  been  stuck  into  places  for  which  they</span><span>  are  not  fit,  will  be  set  aside  to  make  way</span><span>  for  worthy  officers.  At  the  same  time,  so</span><span>  long  as  the  former  are  receiving  as  much</span><span>  as  they  are  worth  they  will  have  no  cause</span><span>  of  complaint.  Besides,  promotion  will</span><span>  still  be  open  to  them.  In  any  event</span><span>  they  will  obtain  the  usual  annual  leave</span><span>  of  absence,  and  the  stated  superannua-</span><span>  tion  allowance  when  they  are  entitled  to</span><span>  it.  Such  arrangements  are  fair  alike  to</span><span>  the  service  and  the  servants.</span></p> <p><span>  With  regard  to  the  future,  all  first</span><span>  appointments  are  to  be  dependent  on</span><span>  merit  alone,  and  independent  of  all</span><span>  political  influence.  All  candidates  for</span><span>  office  will  only  be  admitted  on  the  com-</span><span>  petitive  system.  They  will  be  called</span><span>  upon  to  pass  the  civil  service  examina-</span><span>  tion,  conducted  by  a  board  appointed</span><span>  for  the  purpose.  Those  who  stand</span><span>  highest  in  these  trials  will  receive  the</span><span>  first  appointments,  so  that  though</span><span>  a.  candidate  may  be  the  son  of</span><span>  the  Premier,  that  will  not  affect</span><span>  his  position  in  the  least.  The  best  men</span><span>  will  win,  and  it  will  be  open  for  the  son</span><span>  of  the  humblest  colonist  to  gain  the</span><span>  highest  position  in  the  service.  There</span><span>  are  to  be  two  examinations-one  for</span><span>  positions  in  the  fifth  and  fourth  classes,</span><span>  and  one  for  the  three  hißher.  The</span><span>  effect  of  this  arrangement  will  be  that</span><span>  men  who  have  had  a  good  deal  of  com-</span><span>  mercial  experience  and  training,  who</span><span>  are  well  educated,  and  otherwise  com-</span><span>  petent,  may  be  able  to  enter  and  pass</span><span>  for  appointments  in  the  third  class,</span><span>  without  having  to  undergo  the  drudgery,</span><span>  accept  the  small  pay,  and  do  the  manual</span><span>  work  incumbent  upon  those  in  the  lower</span><span>  classes.  A  great  many  of  those  who  piss</span><span>  for  appointments  in  the  latter,  which</span><span>  must  always  be  the  more  numerous,  do</span><span>  not  look  forward  to  the  higher  appoint-</span><span>  ments,  being  conscious  of  their  inability</span><span>  to  pass  the  higher  examinations.  Still  an</span><span>  officer  will  be  permitted  to  pass  from  the</span><span>  fifth  to  fourth  class  without  further  ex-</span><span>  amination  ;  but  he  must  pass  the  third</span><span>  class  examination  to  fret  higher.  Then</span><span>  seniority  alone  is  not  io  bc  regarded  in</span><span>  connection  with  promotions,  but  m-iit  is</span></p> <p><span>  to  he  taken  into  account.  A  candidat»</span><span>  who  liasses  with  hitrh  honours,  and</span><span>  shows  a  special  apitude  for  the  work</span><span>  committed  to  him,  will  not  be  prevented</span><span>  from  rising  in  the  service  bv  the  inter-</span><span>  vention  of  some  old  duffers,  whose  onlv</span><span>  special  claim  may  bc  that  they  were  in  it</span></p> <p><span>  before  him.</span></p> <p><span>  We  can  conceive  that  (hose  who  have</span></p> <p><span>  been  entrusted  with  the  management  of</span><span>  the  Government  departments  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  public  service  in  Victoria,  will  look</span><span>  forward  with  a  sense  of  coming  relief</span><span>  to  the  operation  of  the  measure</span><span>  introducing  these  reforms.  It  will</span><span>  protect  ministers  and  heads  of  depart-</span><span>  ments  from  a  great  many  unjust</span><span>  reflections.  The  recent  appointment  of</span><span>  Collector  of  Customs  for  this  colony</span><span>  will  occur  to  many  of  our  readers,  as  a</span><span>  case  in  point.  In  it  the  Government</span><span>  appointed  a  smart,  clever,  comparatively</span><span>  youthful  official,  and  their  conduct  in  not</span><span>  regarding  the  claims  of  senior  members</span><span>  of  the  service  was  severely  condemned.</span><span>  In  Victoria  in  future  such  complaints</span><span>  will  be  dangerous,  as  they  may  lead  to</span></p> <p><span>  revelations  not  to  the  credit  of  the  dis-</span><span>  appointed  officers.  We  regard  ""  The</span><span>  Public  Service  Bill  ""  of  Victoria  as  an</span><span>  excellent  measure,  and  trust  we  may  be-</span><span>  fore  long  have  one  like  it  in  this  colony.</span></p> ",Article,1883-09-11,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  KOCK  HAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY,  DECEMBER  7,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Convention  of  Delegates  from  the</span><span>  various  Australasian  colonies,  todeliberate</span><span>  and  determine  on  the  proposed  annexa</span><span>  tion  of  the  New  Guinea  and  the</span><span>  South  Pacific  Islands,  has  concluded  ¡ts</span><span>  sittings  in  Sydney.  A  precis  report  of</span><span>  the  proceedings,  transmitted  by  telegram,</span><span>  has  put  us  in  possession  of  the  resolu-</span><span>  tions  to  whichthey  have  come,  but</span><span>  have  left  us  very  much  in  ignorance  of</span><span>  the  reasons  by  which  the  delegates  were</span><span>  guided  in  condescending  on  them.  For</span><span>  this  ignorance  we  are  indebted  to</span><span>  the  representatives  of  Queensland</span><span>  among  others,  and  whether  it  is</span><span>  blissful  or  not  is  a  question  on  which</span><span>  there  has  been  a  good  deal  of  discussion.</span><span>  One  of  the  first  matters  the  Convention</span><span>  was  called  on  to  consider  was,  whether</span><span>  the  press  should  be  admitted  to  report</span><span>  the  proceedings.  By  a  large  majority</span><span>  it  was  determined  to  exclude  newspaper</span><span>  reporters,  but  to  supply  a  fina's  of  the</span><span>  business  for  publication.  To  this  arrange-</span><span>  ment  we  do  not  think  much  exception</span><span>  can  be  taken.  The  great  advantage  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  publication  of  the  reports  of  such  ,</span><span>  meetings  is  that  they  educate  the  mass</span><span>  of  the  people  on  the  subjects  discussed.</span><span>  The  electors,  who  are  the  Anal  court  of</span><span>  appeal  in  all  matters  of  public  interest,</span></p> <p><span>  arc  thus  enabled  to  judge  of  the  conduct  !</span><span>  of  their  representatives,  and  of  the</span><span>  grounds  by*  which  it  has  been  actuated.</span><span>  It  would,  no  doubt,  have  been  useful</span><span>  and  interesting  to  have  been  furnished</span><span>  with  such  information  respecting  thc</span><span>  recent  convention,  but  in  this  instance</span><span>  there  is  a  foreign  element  to  be  con-</span><span>  sidered.  The  question  of  annexation</span><span>  could  not  be  discussed  without  pointed</span><span>  references  being  made  to  the  possible</span><span>  intentions,  aspirations,  and  interests  of</span><span>  foreign  powers.  These  would  be  read</span><span>  by  the  representatives  of  these  powers,</span><span>  and  transmitted  to  their  respective</span><span>  Governments.  They  would,  in  any</span><span>  event,  be  liable  to  misinterpretation  and</span><span>  misrepresentation,  and  might  be  the</span><span>  means  of  creating  distrust  and  suspicion</span><span>  unnecessarily.  Besides,  prudence  sug-</span><span>  gests  that,  where  the  expression</span><span>  of  opinion  is  apt  to  be  ham-</span><span>  pered  among  the  delegates  on</span><span>  the  one  hand,  and  to  excite</span><span>  hostility  on  the  other,  among  foreign</span><span>  powers  ;  and  where  no  material  harm</span><span>  can  ensue  from  silence,  it  is  the  safer</span><span>  course  to  adopt  the  latter.  It  is  not  in</span><span>  accordance  with  the  policy  of  Radical</span><span>  politicians,  who  would  have  all  that  is</span><span>  done  by  their  representatives  brought  to</span><span>  the  lieht  :  but  we  will  not  obiect  to  our</span></p> <p><span>  delegates  having  in  this  matter  adopted</span></p> <p><span>  a  Conservative  course.</span></p> <p><span>  With  the  results  of  the  Convention</span><span>  we  think  the  public  have  every  reason</span><span>  to  be  satisfied.  The  facts  which  led  us</span><span>  to  start  this  question  of  annexation  were,</span><span>  first,  the  suggestion,  circulated  in  the</span><span>  German  Press,  that  Germany  should</span><span>  colonise  New  Guinea  ;  and,  second,  the</span><span>  proposal,  emanating  from  the  French</span><span>  Government,  that  the  Pacific  Islands</span><span>  should  be  converted  into  penal  stations</span><span>  for  the  reception  of  criminals.  What  we</span><span>  dreaded  was  the  domination  of  a  first</span></p> <p><span>  rate  European  power,  and  the  establish-</span><span>  ment  in  our  neighbourhood  of  nurseries</span><span>  of  lawlessness,  and  crime.  Upon</span><span>  these  points  the  Convention  has  uttered</span><span>  no  uncertain  sound,  and  yet  it  has</span><span>  done  so  in  a  manner  that  should</span><span>  not  give  offence  to  the  most  susceptible</span><span>  of  the  powers  of  Europe.  The  first</span><span>  resolution  agreed  upon  set  forth  that  the</span><span>  intrusion  of  any  European  Power  in  the</span><span>  South  Pacific  would  be  regarded  as</span><span>  detrimental  to  the  interests  of  Aus-</span><span>  tralasia,  and  of  those  of  the  British</span><span>  Empire.  An  amendment  declaring  that</span><span>  the  acquisition  of  dominion  by  any</span><span>  foreign  power  would  be  regarded  as</span><span>  injurious  to  the  interests  of  Australasia</span><span>  and  making  no  reference  to  the  British</span><span>  Empire  was  afterwards  adopted.  So  far</span><span>  as  we  can  make  out  the  amendment  was</span><span>  an  improvement  on  the  original  resolu-</span><span>  tion,  because  it  does  not  involve  us  in</span><span>  the  maintenance  of  the  foreign  policy  of</span><span>  the  British  Government.  There  was  no</span></p> <p><span>  occasion  for  the  colonies  constituting</span><span>  themselves  the  champions  of  the  British</span><span>  Empire  in  the  Pacific.  When  they  guard</span><span>  the  interests  of  Australia  they  protect</span><span>  the  Empire,  and  there  was  no  need  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  exhibition  of  ""  Rule  Britanniaism  ""</span><span>  which  appeared  in  the  first  resolution.</span><span>  There  seemed  to  be  no  doubt  entertained</span><span>  as  to  the  propriety  of  annexing  the  por-</span><span>  tion  of  New  Guinea,  not  already  under</span><span>  the  protection  of  the  Dutch.  Indeed,</span><span>  after  indicating  the  reasons  for  it,  the</span><span>  Convention  declared  it  to  be  its  emphatic</span><span>  opinion  that  annexation  was  desirable.</span><span>  The  resolution  puts  the  arguments  for  it</span><span>  very  succinctly,  and  its  declaration  leaves</span><span>  no  doubt  upon  it.  All  this  unity  and</span><span>  determination,  displayed  at  present,  is  in</span><span>  marked  contrast  to  the  indifference  which</span><span>  prevailed  before  Sir  Thomas  Mcilwraith</span><span>  sent  the  Police  Magistrate  at  Thursday</span><span>  Island  to  unfurl  the  British  Ensign  on</span><span>  the  shores  of  New  Guinea.  That  pro-</span><span>  ceeding  was  described  by  our  Premier  as</span><span>  a  fiasco,  but  it  drew  atention  to  the  sub-</span><span>  ject  in  a  practical  fashion,  which  could</span><span>  not  have  been  done  by  any  other  means.</span><span>  It  was  a  decided  step  in  the  right</span><span>  direction,  and  though  the  method</span><span>  was  questioned  the  object  was  approved</span><span>  of.  The  unusual  character  of  the  step</span><span>  taken  drew  attention  to  the  object  to  be</span><span>  gained  by  it,  and  that  was  the  main  pur-</span><span>  pose  of  the  proceeding.  In  this  case</span><span>  the  end  has  justified  the  means.</span></p> <p><span>  On  tlie  question  of  the  annexation  of</span><span>  the  Pacific  Islands  the  Convention  did</span><span>  not  express  so  decided  an  opinion.</span><span>  There  was  some  difference  of  views</span></p> <p><span>  on  the  subject  among  the  delegates,</span><span>  but  ultimately  they  declared  that  it</span><span>  would  be  well  to  hare  any  agreement,</span><span>  about  them  entered  into  by  the  Euro-</span><span>  pean  Powers,  placed  on  record  ;  and</span><span>  that  they  would  be  pleased  to  see  them</span><span>  associated  with  the  Australasian  colonies</span><span>  under  the  British  Crown.  They  declared</span><span>  their  willingness  to  assist  in  paying  the</span><span>  cost  of  government.  The  Convention,</span><span>  in  most  emphatic  terms,  protested</span><span>  against  the  proposal  of  France  to</span><span>  transport  large  numbers  of  criminals</span><span>  to  the  Pacific.  Upon  reviewing  the</span><span>  resolutions  it  will  be  seen  that  the  prac-</span><span>  tical  work  done  by  the  Convention  has</span><span>  consisted  of  little  more  than  a  formal,</span><span>  concise,  and  united  expression  of</span><span>  opinions,  that  were  entertained  in  all</span><span>  the  colonies.  The  Press  long  since</span><span>  showed  what  were  the  sentiments  of  the</span><span>  colonists  on  the  questions  raised,  and</span><span>  the  Convention  has  embodied  them.</span><span>  The  delegates  have  done  a  good  work,</span><span>  and  have  done  it  fairly  well.</span></p> <p><span>  They  luve  also  taken  an  initiative</span><span>  step  towards  federation,  the  consumma-</span><span>  tion  of  which  has  been  the  hope  of</span><span>  many  of  the  best  public  men  in</span><span>  tlie  colonies.  Lord  Derby,  in  his</span><span>  correspondence  on  the  annexation</span><span>  question,  suggested  federation  as  an</span><span>  important  factor  in  its  accomplish-</span><span>  ment,  and  the  Convention  have  not  over-</span><span>  looked  his  Lordship's  hint.  They  have</span><span>  agreed  to  resolutions  in  favour  of  a</span><span>  Federal  Council  ;  and  have  set  them-</span><span>  selves  to  draft  a  Bill  for  its  constitution.</span><span>  This  measure  will  be  presented  to  tlie</span><span>  Parliaments  of  the  Australasian  colonies,</span><span>  and  should  it  meet  with  their  approval</span><span>  then  the  Federal  Council  will  become</span><span>  in  deed  an  Australian  Parliament.  Our</span><span>  information  regarding  thc  constitution  of</span><span>  the  proposed  Council,  and  the  class  of</span><span>  subjects  to  be  dealt  with  by  it  is  too</span><span>  limited  to  admit  of  our  discussing  them</span><span>  at  present,  but  they  are  of  the  first  im-</span><span>  portance,  and  ai  oportunity  offers  should</span></p> <p><span>  receive  the  careful  consideration  of  all</span><span>  colonists.</span></p> ",Article,1883-12-07,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  ,.'  FRIDAY,  DECEMBER  21,  1683.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Sydney  Convention  cannot  claim,</span><span>  and  has  not  claimed,  any  legislative</span><span>  authority.  -  For  all  practical  purposes  '  it</span><span>  has  simply  been  a  meeting  of  the  leading</span><span>  men,  who  for  the  time  being  are  respon-</span><span>  sible  for  the  executive  authority  of  the</span><span>  Australasian  Colonies.'

The  resolutions  agreed</span><span>  to  on  the  annexation  question  are</span><span>  no  doubt  most  important,  and  will  un-</span><span>  questionably  lead  the  way  .to  further</span><span>  action,  on  the  part  of  the  Government</span><span>  which  we  call  Imperial-that  is,  the</span><span>  Government  of  the  Queen  in  so  far  as  it</span><span>  relates  to  the  British  Empire.  Yet  it  is</span><span>  quite  certain,  nevertheless,  that  the</span><span>  Queen's  Ministers  will  act  .entirely  on</span><span>  their'  own  judgment  br  responsibility  in</span><span>  carrying  out  the  recommendations  made.</span><span>  They  are  recommendations^  and  nothing</span><span>  more.  '  :  '  '  '</span></p> <p><span>  But,  in  dealing'with  the  other  matters</span><span>  so  fully  discussed,  and  io  drafting  a  Bill</span><span>  to  provide  a  Federal  Council  for  Aus-</span><span>  tralia,  these  sixteen  representative  gen-</span><span>  tlemen  tóok  a  step  a  long  way  in  advance</span><span>  of  any  thing  yet  attempted  at  any  Con-</span><span>  ference,  and  they  have  no  doubt  laid  thc</span><span>  foundation'for  future  federal  action  if</span></p> <p><span>  it  is  ever  possible  to  attain  it.,  What,</span><span>  then,  has  been  done  ?  It  is  essential</span><span>  we  should  clearly  understand  this.  The</span><span>  six  gentlemen  who  at  present  are  at  the</span><span>  'heads  of  their  respective  administration</span><span>  in  the  Colonies  of  Australasja  have</span></p> <p><span>  nlerlnfid  thfimselvés  to  submit  this  ques-</span><span>  tion  of  federal  action  to  their  several</span><span>  legislatures,  in  the  form  of  an  enabling</span><span>  bill,  which,  after  consultation,  they  have</span><span>  agreed  to.  This,  then,  involves  the</span><span>  relegation  of  this  question  to  the</span><span>  different  legislatures  for  discussion  in  a</span><span>  definite  shape,  to  which  they  are  bound</span><span>  tb  say  either  yes  or  no.  The  question,</span><span>  then,  of  federal  action  will  no  lunger  be</span><span>  allowed  to1  float  about  in  an  ethereal</span><span>  strata  of  the  political  atmosphere  a  long</span><span>  way  above  the  heads  of  our  ordinary</span><span>  legislators.  They  are  to  be  invited  to</span><span>  signify  their  assent  or  their  dissent  to</span><span>  this  bill,  and  if  their  assent  to</span><span>  signify  this,  by  an  address  to  Her</span><span>  Majesty's  Government,  to  be  followed</span><span>  up  by  Parliamentary  action,  includ-</span><span>  ing  the  assent  of  the  lords,  spiritual</span><span>  and  temporal.  -  Here,  then  it  is  manifest</span><span>  that,  by  some  means  or  other  this  gaseous</span><span>  body  labelled  federation,  which  has  been</span><span>  floating  about  in  mid  air,  the  property  of</span></p> <p><span>  two  or  three  adventurous  aeronauts  has</span><span>  at  last  been  dragged  to  earth  and  de-</span><span>  prived  of  its  expansive  stuffing.  A</span></p> <p><span>  ballon  thus  reduced  to  its  substantial</span><span>  essence  is  a  sorry  spectacle,  with  but</span><span>  scant  furnishing  of  such  body  and  bones</span><span>  as  we  expect  in  a  vehicle  fitted  for  loco-</span><span>  motion  on  the  surface  of  the  earth.</span><span>  Nevertheless,  the  balloon  is  caught-we</span><span>  can  now  analyse  its  structure,  and  if  it</span><span>  so  pleases  ""the  Divinities  who  shape</span><span>  our  ends  rough  hew  them  as  we  may  ""</span><span>  it  is  just  possible  that  the  shapeless</span><span>  wreck,  as  it  now  looks,  may  yet  be  en-</span><span>  dowed  with  a  life  which  may  send  it</span><span>  spinning  on  through  the  stormy  universe.</span></p> <p><span>  Who  can  tell?</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  meantime  the  Federal  Council</span><span>  Bill,  as  agreed  to  by  the  Convention,  is  a</span><span>  singularly  embrionic  creation,  to  all  out-</span><span>  ward  appearance  utterly  unsuitable  for</span><span>  any  great  purpose  of  national  union</span><span>  or  usefulness.  Yet,  having  regard  to  the</span><span>  infinite  insignificance,  and  even  to  the</span><span>  repulsiveness  of  nature  in  the  ruder</span><span>  forms  of  creative  energy,  it  becomes  us</span><span>  well  to  remember  that  first  effects,  like</span><span>  these  in  the  direction  of  national</span><span>  acquirements,  have  often  been  mere</span><span>  abortions  which  have  lo  be  rectified  by</span><span>  time  and  experience.  When,  therefore,</span><span>  we  come  to  think  what  might  have  been</span><span>  thirty  years  ago,  when  the  Aus-</span><span>  tralian  constitutions  were  being  passed</span><span>  through  the  hands  of  our  legislative</span><span>  artificers,  this  Federal  Council  Bill  looks</span><span>  like  a  farce.  It  had  then  been  contem-</span></p> <p><span>  plated,  and  indeed  was  so  designed  by</span><span>  Her  Majesty's  faithful  Commons  in</span><span>  Parliament  assembled  that  Her  Majesty</span><span>  should  provide  for  the  meeting  of  an</span><span>  Australian  Parliament.  Yet  our  ""  lords</span><span>  spiritual  and  temporal""  being  not  improb-</span><span>  ably  the  repositories  at  that  time  of  that</span><span>  power  which  shapes  our  ends  rough</span><span>  hew  them  as  we  may,  determined  that</span><span>  this  should  not  lie,  and,  dissent-</span><span>  ing  from  the  Commons,  they  decreed</span><span>  that  Her  Majesty  should  not  have  any</span><span>  such  reserved  rights  as  those  prefigured</span><span>  in  the  Bill.  The  conséquence  was  that</span><span>  the  Australian  Colonies  were  started  in</span><span>  life  each  with  their  constitution  so  very</span><span>  much  unlimited  that  lhere  was  no  room</span></p> <p><span>  left  for  atty  Superior  authority,  -except</span><span>  that  of  the-Queen'6  herself.  Each  is  a</span></p> <p><span>  .liul^State  itt  itself  with  legislative  powers,</span></p> <p><span>  which,  by  osage,  fcavf  ,become  almost</span><span>  unlimited,  or  limited''  only""  by  the</span><span>  ajjegiauce  which  they  bear  to  the  sove-</span></p> <p><span>  reign.  Look  at  Victoria.  As  a  Slate</span><span>  Victoria  is  excessively  4oyal,  sentimen-</span><span>  tally  joya,  tor  almost  a  painful  ¡degroeyr</span><span>  and  yet  Victoria,  by  her  Parliament,</span><span>  claims  absolute  and  unlimited  indepen-</span><span>  dence  within  the  mystic  circumference  of</span><span>  the  British  Empire.  ?  '</span></p> <p><span>  Where  then  is  the  margin  for  federal</span><span>  action?  The  Federal  Council  Bill  is</span><span>  the  answer  we  have  to  this  most  per-</span><span>  tinent  question-and  what  does  it  pro-</span><span>  pose  to  do?  It  proposes  to  do  as</span><span>  little  as  it  '  possibly  can  in  the</span><span>  first  instance  -  and  why  ?  .  ?  Because</span><span>  if  it  did  it  would  arouse  the</span><span>  enmity  and'the'  opposition  of  the  existing</span><span>  legislatures.  :  The  Federal  Council</span><span>  Bill  proposes  then  to  create  a  most</span></p> <p><span>  singular1  body  for  legislative  purposes  ;  it</span><span>  proposes  thaf  they  shpuld  meet  at  rare</span><span>  intervals,  and  that  they  shall  have  as</span><span>  little  as  possible  to  do.  À  Federal</span><span>  Council  inferior  in  any  respect  to  the</span><span>  legislatures  from  which  it  will  derive</span><span>  its  existence,  is  an  anomaly  in  constitu-</span><span>  tional  history,  and  yet  such  is  the  present</span><span>  position  of  the  Australian  Colonies,  and</span><span>  suth  are  the  privileges  of  the  respective</span><span>  legislatures  that  there  peem's  to  be  no</span><span>  place  left  for  functional  development</span><span>  except  by  sprue  such  process  as  that</span><span>  which  has  been  devised.  A  legislative</span><span>  unjon  between  two  or  more  colonies  is,</span><span>  a  possibility  involving  absolute  incorpora-'</span><span>  tion,  but.,no  Australian  Colonies  con-</span><span>  template  this  at  present.  They  have</span><span>  fallen  back,  therefore,  upon  this  federal</span><span>  compact  as  a  possibility,  and  they  fancy</span><span>  that  they  are  about  to  find  a  bond  of</span><span>  union  in  a  foreign  policy.  The  Island</span><span>  question  is  .this  foreign  policy,  and</span><span>  having  :found  something,  tangible  on</span><span>  which  tq  poise  the  lever,  it  is  .possible</span><span>  that  they  may  evojve  a  mode  of  action.</span></p> <p><span>  Sut  it  if  evident  that  before  this  is</span><span>  accomplished1  the  subject  has  to  be</span><span>  well  discussed  in  every  legislature  which</span><span>  will  be  affected  by  it.</span></p> ",Article,1883-12-21,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

If,  for  instance,  emigration  com-</span><span>  panies,  operating  in  England,  wore  empowered</span><span>  to  engage  men  for  certain  terms  and  wages  for</span><span>  plantation  work,  there  is  little  doubt  the</span><span>  difficulty  would  be  met.  The  Chinese  adopted</span><span>  this  plan  in  introducing  labourers  into  Cali-</span><span>  fornia,  and  though  in  their  case  it  was</span><span>  véritable  slavery,  the  principle  at  the  bottom</span><span>  was  that  of  associated  labour  working  in</span><span>  defined  terms;  The  assertion  that  Europeans</span><span>  declined  the  work,  and  it  was  not  fit  for  them</span><span>  is  easily  answered.  With  tho  limited  number</span><span>  of  Europeans  introduced  it  was  not  to  bo</span><span>  expected  that  the  men  coming  here  would</span><span>  choose  the  worst  remunerated  kind  of  labour.""</span></p> <p><span>  Now,  the  working  men  will  observe  that  tho</span><span>  argumont  is  that  it  was  on  account  of  thc</span><span>  limitednnmberintroduoedintothecountry  ;  and</span><span>  that  were'emigrants  from  Europebroughtoutin</span><span>  unlimited  numbers  wages  would  fall  all  round  ;</span><span>  consequently  they  would  then  as  soon  work  on</span><span>  the  sugar  plantations  as  at  any  other  kinds  of</span><span>  labour,  when  the  wages  were  the  same.

"<p><span>  [OVlÙHflillUctM,</span></p> <p><span>  KOCK  ll  A  MI-TON.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  MASCH  31,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  general  awakening  of  interest  in</span><span>  the  subject  of  immigration  throughout</span><span>  Australia  is  a  very  noticeable  and  ought</span><span>  to  be  an  encouraging  sign  of  the  times.</span><span>  In  all  the  colonies  the  cry  for  ""more</span><span>  hands""  is  heard.  We  know  what  we</span><span>  ourselves  are  doing.  In  New  South</span><span>  Wales,  a  steady  importation  of  immi-</span><span>  grants  is  going  on,  and  provision  for</span><span>  largely  increasing  the  supply  has  just</span><span>  been  made.  South  Australia,  which  has</span><span>  of  late  years  reverted  in  a  timid  and</span><span>  tentative  manner  to  ¡ts  old  policy  of</span><span>  importing  population,  shows  a  disposi-</span><span>  tion  to  launch  out  again  into  a  regular</span><span>  system  of  State  immigration.  In  Victoria,</span><span>  where  complete  and  selfish  isolation  is</span><span>  regarded  as  the  ""  settled  policy  of  the</span><span>  country,""  the  resumption  of  assisted</span><span>  immigration  is  being  discussed  as  a</span><span>  possible  contingency.  Even  in  Tas-</span><span>  mania,  where,  from  various  causes,  there!</span><span>  is  really  little  opening  for  new-comers,</span><span>  the  desirability  of  encouraging  immigra-</span><span>  tion  has  cropped  up  as  a  public  question.</span></p> <p><span>  Some  deduction  must  be  made  for</span></p> <p><span>  temporary  and  accidental  causes  in  esti-</span><span>  mating  the  value  of  this  apparently</span><span>  unanimous  impulse  towards  the  re-</span><span>  sumption  of  an  Australian  policy  of</span><span>  immigration.  It  has  been  harvest  time,</span><span>  and  general  prosperity  having  sent</span><span>  people  flocking  ioto  the  towns,  there</span><span>  has  been  a  great  dearth  of  hands</span><span>  in  the  fields,  throughout  the  two</span><span>  I  great  agricultural  colonies  of  Victoria</span></p> <p><span>  and  South  Australia  Something</span><span>  over  twenty  million  bushels  of  wheat</span><span>  have  to  be  reaped,  bagged,  and</span><span>  transported,  and  the  strain  on  the</span><span>  country  labour  market  is  severe.  It  is</span><span>  noticeable  that  about  harvest  time  there</span><span>  is  always  some  reference  made  to  the</span><span>  need  of  more  population  in  the  two</span><span>  colonies  mentioned.  But  the  erv  this</span></p> <p><span>  year  is  very  much  stronger  than  it  ever</span><span>  was  before.  Wages  are  exceedingly</span><span>  high,  and  as  all  the  colonies  are  freely</span><span>  carrying  on  public  works,  both  through</span><span>  their  general  and  municipal  govern</span><span>  !  ments,  and  propose  to  increase  rather</span></p> <p><span>  j  than  diminish  the  rate  of  public  ex-</span></p> <p><span>  penditure,  it  is  evident  that  relief  must  be</span><span>  afforded  to  the  labour  market  or  evil  will</span><span>  result.  It  is  bad  for  a  colony  when  labour</span><span>  is  underpaid,  it  is  equally  bad  for  it  when</span><span>  labour  is  so  highly  renumerated  that  the</span><span>  cost  of  production  leaves  no  margin  of</span><span>  profit  to  the  producer.  The  enormous</span><span>  rate  of  wages  paid  in  Victoria  during  the</span><span>  gold  excitement,  and  in  other  parts  of</span><span>  Australia  during  similar  periods,  are  not</span><span>  cases  in  point,  because  the  profits  were</span><span>  then  abnormal  and  the  renumeration  for</span><span>  work,  though  actually  very  high,  was  not</span><span>  disproportionate  to  the  value  of  its  pro-</span><span>  duce.  But  the  present  prosperity  of</span><span>  Australia  is  due  to  the  extension  of</span><span>  industries-chiefly  pastoral  and  agricul-</span><span>  tural  -  which  though  decidedly  re</span><span>  numcrative  are  not  yielding  excessively</span><span>  high  average  profits,  and  can  be  easily</span><span>  stifled  by  being  over  loaded  with  costs.</span><span>  It  must  be  remembered  that  capital  is</span><span>  entirely  beyond  our  control  ;  we  can  no</span><span>  more  keep  it  in  our  colonies  than  wc  can</span><span>  grasp  and  hold  a  wreath  of  smoke.  We</span><span>  may  import  it  by  millions  in  the  shape</span><span>  of  public  loans,  but  if  it  does  not  find</span><span>  profitable  employaient  h.Te,  the  money</span></p> <p><span>  will  slip  »way  elsewhere  to  seek  for  it.  '</span><span>  Tbe  only  capitalist  we  can  compel  to</span><span>  carry  on  1f0tjc  *t  a  loss  is  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment;  and  to""  depend  on  this  power  to</span><span>  make  up  for  the  loss  of  private  invest-</span><span>  ment  would  be  just  as  wise  a  thing  to</span></p> <p><span>  do  as  for  a  workman  to  expect  to  j</span><span>  -console  himself/or  the  loss  of  employ-  j</span><span>  raent  and  h\s  weekly  wage,  by  taking  !</span><span>  shillings  out  of  his  coat  and  putting</span></p> <p><span>  them  into  his  trousers.</span></p> <p><span>  All  these  arearguments  with  which  we</span><span>  are  familiar,  and  which  need  not  be</span><span>  urged  on  our  own  public.  Queensland</span><span>  has  never,  in  hex  darkest  hour,  lost  faith</span><span>  io  assisted  inmigration,  even  though  she</span><span>  has  been  put  to  sore  straits  at  times  to</span><span>  keep  it  up.  BIL  we  reproduce  them  for</span><span>  the  benefit  of  our  neighbours  in  the</span><span>  south,  feeling  justified  in  doing  so  by</span><span>  seeing  the  fa'triliar  illustration  of  the</span><span>  money  value  à  an  immigration  reap-</span><span>  pearing  as  a  iovelty  in  the  leading</span><span>  columns  of  sich  a  journal  as  the</span></p> <p><span>  Melbourne  Argu.  We  desire  to  impress</span><span>  on  them  the  necessity  of  acting  while  in</span><span>  their  present  fume  of  mind,  and  taking</span><span>  really  practical  steps  for  providing  an</span><span>  influx  of  po|ulation  equal  to  the</span><span>  growing  need  of  the  Continent.</span><span>  There  are  ""lenty  of  politicians  in</span><span>  the  south  who  hug  themselves  in</span><span>  the  belief  mat  they  will  always</span><span>  get  a  sufficiency  of  people  from  the  sup-</span><span>  ply  imported  by  the  colonies  which  assist</span><span>  immigration.  This  is  especially  the  case</span><span>  in  Victoria-¡hat  colony  so  exceedingly</span><span>  Australian  and  patriotic  in  speech,  and  so</span><span>  intensely  selfish  and  provincial  in  action.</span><span>  But  it  must  be  dealt  with  in  a  broader</span><span>  and  bolder  spirit  now  that  the  colonies</span><span>  have  established  such  close  intercom-</span></p> <p><span>  munication,  pnless  Australian  progress  is</span><span>  to  be  alternately  checked,  first,  by  the</span><span>  want  of  poptlation  to  apply  money  ready</span><span>  for  investnent,  and  then  by  the</span><span>  want  of  capital  frightened  out  of  the</span><span>  country  by  exorbitant  rates  of  wages.</span><span>  Mo  'Fran«  Stuart  who  read  a</span><span>  timid  and  contradictory  paper  on  the</span><span>  subject  at  a  conference  between  the  Mel-</span><span>  bourne  Chambers  of  Commerce  and</span><span>  Manufactures  a  few  weeks  since,  said  he</span><span>  did.  not  think  it  could  be  satisfactorily</span><span>  arranged  until  the  advent  of  federation.</span><span>  For  our.  part  *we'  are  inclined  to  think</span><span>  that  federationwili  never  be  satisfactorily</span></p> <p><span>  arranged  until  the  colonies  are  able  to  ,</span><span>  understand  th«  necessity  for  joint  action</span><span>  in  a  matter  ol  such  obviously  common</span></p> <p><span>  interest,  and  tike  the  necessary  steps  to  I</span><span>  carry  it  out.  ill  that  would  be  required</span></p> <p><span>  is  for  ea  ch  cololy  to  provident)  proportion  j</span><span>  to  itspopulatioi  and  revenue,  for  a  regular</span></p> <p><span>  annual  import  if  immigrants.  Each  could  |</span></p> <p><span>  dei  as  we  art:  doing  now  in  regard  to  I</span><span>  the  internal  tistribution  of  the  new-</span><span>  comers,  and  'each  could  select  by</span><span>  preference  thejclass  of  people  it  con</span></p> <p><span>  kept  up  a  fair  aimerica!  proportion.  If</span><span>  this  were  done  there  would  be  no  need</span></p> <p><span>  for  any  special  irecaution  against  immi-</span><span>  grants  leaving  Sne  colony  for  another.</span><span>  If  one  roan  landed  in  Queensland</span><span>  thought  he  woild  prefer  Victoria  as  a</span><span>  permanent  home,  there  would  be  another</span><span>  who  would  findjhis  way  from  that  colony</span></p> <p><span>  and  the  result)  beneficial  to  all.  Let</span><span>  Victoria  abanrjan  her  attitude  of  selfish</span><span>  isolation  and  teasing  to  reckon  on  pro</span><span>  fitting  by  the  immigration  expenditure</span><span>  of  her  neighlours,  lay  out  her  fair</span><span>  proportion  of  tie  cost  of  peopling  Aus-</span><span>  tralia,  and  let  New  South  Wales  and</span><span>  South  Australia  increase  their  annual  ex-</span><span>  penditure  to  a  lum  more  in  accordance</span><span>  with  the  aecesf  ties  of  the  case,  and  the</span><span>  thing  is  done.5  And  when  we  see  the</span><span>  Southern  colqiies  in  this  simple  and</span><span>  natural  manne;  give  a  practical  proof</span><span>  that  the  Australian  communities  really</span><span>  recognise  the  ¿ct  that  they  bare  mutual</span><span>  duties  and  a  rational  aim  in  view,  we</span></p> <p><span>  shall  be  disposed  to  believe  that  at  last</span></p> <p><span>  a  solid  substratim  of  reality  is  forming  |</span><span>  itself  beneath'the  heaps  of  oratorical</span><span>  froth  which  nov  surround  the  question</span><span>  of  federation.  <</span></p> <p><span>  RUMOUR  has  it  that  the  ill-advised  snit</span><span>  Miles  v.

"<p><span>  MONDAY,  APHIl-,  23,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  DEVOTION  to  principles  is  generally  lo</span><span>  be  regarded  as  a  virtue,  and  a  consistent</span><span>  man  will  obtain  a  certain  amount  of</span></p> <p><span>  respect  from  others,  even  though  he  may</span><span>  be  at  variance  with  the  principles  they</span><span>  themselves  uphold.  There  are  many</span><span>  principles  which  very  eminent  men  have</span><span>  endorsed,  that  have  since  their  time,  and</span><span>  even  during  their  lives,  been  brought</span><span>  into  question,  and  their  soundness  tested,</span><span>  the  effect  of  which  has  been  to  modify,</span><span>  and  in  some  instances  entirely  reverse</span><span>  them.  In  young  countries,  one  great</span><span>  .problem  before  statesmen  is  how  to</span><span>  develop  dormant  resources;  and  the</span><span>  first  difficulty  that  is  met  with  on  the</span><span>  threshold  is  the  competition  to  be  con-</span><span>  tended  against,  by  all  industries  in  new</span><span>  countries,  with  articles  which  are  imported</span><span>  from  old  States,  in  which  such  industries</span><span>  are  thoroughly  established,  and  economi-</span><span>  cally  carried  on.  The  difficulty  of  obtain-</span><span>  ing  labour,  owing  to  the  scarcity  of</span><span>  population  in  a  youthful  nation,  is  also</span><span>  at  all  times  a  chief  obstacle  in  the  way</span><span>  of  progress.</span></p> <p><span>  As  to  how  the  difficulties  pointed  out</span><span>  are  to  be  met,  there  will  of  course</span><span>  always  be  a  difference  of  opinion,  but</span><span>  upon  the  existence  of  the  difficulties,</span><span>  and  the  desirability  of  overcoming  them,</span><span>  there  is  unity.  Unfortunately  when</span><span>  attempting  to  deal  with  this  important</span><span>  and  intricate  subject,  those  who  discuss</span><span>  it  generally  enter  upon  its  consideration</span><span>  with  some  pet  theory  of  their  own  to</span><span>  maintain.  They  start  wilh  some  principle</span><span>  of  their  own,  which  they  deem  immacu-</span><span>  late,  and  anything  that  violates  such</span><span>  principle  must  in  their  opinion  neces-</span><span>  sarily  be  wrong.  Argument  with  them</span><span>  is  perfectly  useless  ;  the  partizan  stands</span><span>  by  his  favourite  principle  grimly  deter-</span><span>  mined,  and  says  :  ""  Adam  Smith  laid</span><span>  down  a  certain  principle  as  essential  to</span><span>  the  wealth  of  nations  ;  what  is  being</span><span>  proposed  violates  that  principle  ;  I  am</span><span>  with  Mr.  Smith,  and  will  never  surrender</span><span>  his  principle.""  Of  course  when  you</span><span>  get  a  noble  patriot  on  his  mighty</span><span>  ""  rock  ""  in  this  manner,  the  only  thing</span><span>  to  do  is  to  leave  him  there,  in  the  hope</span><span>  that  the  intelligent  electors  will  in  due</span><span>  j  season  remove  such  a  clog  to  the  wheels</span></p> <p><span>  of  progress.  If  this  peculiar  class  of</span><span>  legislator  heard  a  man  insisting  that</span><span>  I  steamers,  such  as  the  ""  Orient  ""  liners,</span></p> <p><span>  were  a  mistake,  because  Noah  built  on</span><span>  a  different  pattern,  and  Noah  knew  all</span></p> <p><span>  about  ship-building,  he  would  be  amazed  i</span><span>  at  such  monstrous  absurdity.  Yet  him-</span><span>  self  sticks  to  Adam  Smith  in  precisely</span></p> <p><span>  the  same  manner  as  the  oilier  would  to</span><span>  Noah  :  one  is  not  more  obstinate  than</span><span>  the  other.</span></p> <p><span>  Among  other  industries  that  of  sugar-V</span><span>  growing  is  undoubtedly  one  of  primary</span><span>  importance  to  the  prosperity  of  Queens-</span><span>  land.  This  all  admit  ;  but  as  soon  as</span><span>  it  is  attempted  to  ascertain  the  best</span><span>  method  of  fostering  that  industry,  nearly</span><span>  every  one  digs  up  some  principle  of</span><span>  political  economy,  laid  down  generally</span><span>  by  a  long-defunct  genius,  who  had  no</span><span>  practical  expérience  of  Queensland,  and,</span><span>  therefore,  could  not  lay  clown  principles</span><span>  essential  lo  her  progress  and  prosperity,</span><span>  and  having  exhumed  this  inviolable</span><span>  principle  gets  on  it,  and  wont  be</span><span>  knocked  off.  In  considering  the  best</span><span>  method  of  fostering  sugar-growing  the</span><span>  most  practical  procedure  is  to  determine</span><span>  how  sug.ir  is  produced  elsewhere,  and</span><span>  what  competition  will  our  own  produce</span><span>  be  likely  to  meet  with  from  foreign  imports.</span><span>  There  are  two  courses  that  now  suggest</span><span>  themselves  :  one  is  to  impose  a  pro-</span><span>  hibitory  import  duty  on  sugar,  the  other</span><span>  to  grow  it  as  cheaply  here  as  elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span>  If  the  former  course  were  followed  the</span></p> <p><span>  price  of  stig  ir  to  the  consumer  would</span><span>  be  tremendous-say  retail  Sd.  to  is.  per</span><span>  lb.,  because  to  make  sugar-growing  suffi-</span><span>  ciently  remunerative  to  pay  white  men</span><span>  to  weed  the  cane,  cut  it,  and  do  other</span><span>  work  of  the  kind  on  plantations,  it  would</span></p> <p><span>  be  necessary  to  gel  a  high  price  for  the</span><span>  article.  None  would  pay  Sd.  for  home-</span><span>  grown  sugar,  however,  if  the  imported</span><span>  article  could  be  obtained  cheaper,  and  thus</span><span>  a  heavy  import  duty  would  have  to  be</span><span>  imposed.  Here  the  never-say-die  ad-</span><span>  vocate  of  Free-trade  would  certainly</span><span>  get  on  his  ""  rock,""  and  cry  out  about</span><span>  violating  some  principle  ;  the  duty</span><span>  would  not  be  permitted,  and  the  industry</span><span>  would  be  retarded  while  such  person</span><span>  piously  obstructed.  Undoubtedly  the</span><span>  protective  policy  would  be  inexpedient,</span><span>  since  it  would  tend  to  increase  the</span><span>  price  of  a  very  necessary  article  of  diet.</span></p> <p><span>  Turning  to  the  other  proposition</span><span>  that  is,  to  the  endeavour  to  grow  the</span><span>  article  as  cheaply  here  as  elsewhere-the</span><span>  question  arises-how  can  we  grow  sugar</span><span>  here,  so  as  to  compete  with  the  imported</span><span>  article,  without  increasing  the  price  of  it</span><span>  to  consumers?  On  studying  sugar</span><span>  growing  countries,  we  find  that  in  all</span><span>  such  very  cheap  labour  is  employed,  and</span><span>  if  we  are  ever  to  compete  with  them  we</span><span>  must  have  the  same.  If  there  is  a  man,</span><span>  who  can  and  will  do  the  work  for  ^24</span><span>  a-year  and  a  few  bags  of  rice,  thal  is  the</span><span>  man  we  must  have,  if  we  want  to  grow</span><span>  our  own  sugar,  and  retail  it  cheap.</span><span>  When  this  is  proposed  the  advocate  of</span><span>  the  working-man  gels  on  his  ""rock,""</span><span>  talks  about  lowering  wages,  and  driving</span><span>  thc  poor  British  workman  out  of  the</span><span>  country.  Now,  we  do  not  believe  that</span><span>  any  race  of  men  under  the  sun  could</span><span>  ever  drive  a  genuine  liritish  mechanic  off</span><span>  the  continent.  He  can  do  his  work,  and</span><span>  follow  his  handicraft  without  fearing  any</span><span>  man  in  the  world,  and  the  only  man  who</span><span>  is  afraid  of  competition  is  the  man  who</span><span>  knows  he  is  no  good.  Cheap  labour  for</span><span>  sugar  plantations  will  not  lower  the</span><span>  wages  of  bootmakers,  boilermakers,</span><span>  tailors,  &c;  on  the  contrary  it  will  in-</span><span>  crease  the  demand  for  machinery  of  all</span><span>  kinds,  and  give  an  impetus  to  the  iron</span><span>  trades  ;  it  will  increase  the  demand  for</span><span>  meat  and  bread,  and  drive  butchers  and</span><span>  bakers  ahead.  The  only  man  in  the</span><span>  country  who  would  feel  the  injury  at  the</span><span>  introduction  of  cheap  labour  on  planta-</span><span>  tions  would  he  the  idle  loafer,  who</span><span>  wanted  to  get  big  wages  for  doing  low</span><span>  class  plantation  work.  Even  New  South</span><span>  Wales  turns  to  the  contemplation  of</span><span>  the  sugar  industry  by  observing  that</span><span>  in  other  countries  coloured  labour</span><span>  can  produce  the  article  cheaper  than</span><span>  the  home  cultivator,  and  begins  to</span><span>  realise  that  to  compete  in  the  industry</span><span>  cheap  lahour  is  essential.  As  might  be</span><span>  expected,  as  soon  as  this  question  comes</span><span>  up  each  enlightend  debater  rolls  out  his</span><span>  ""  rock,""  gets  on  it,  and  screams  aghast</span><span>  ""Slavery!  Reduction!  Ruination  to</span><span>  to  the  poor-working  man!""  and  hopes  by</span><span>  this  eternal  yelling  to  hoodwink  the  elec-</span><span>  tors,  and  evenutually  drift  off  his  ""rock""</span><span>  on  to  the  Treasury  benches,  for  which</span><span>  his  soul  yearns.  Patriots  of  this  class</span><span>  are  on  the  war-path  now,  and  dance  on</span><span>  their  little  ""  rocks  ""  in  frantic  anticipa-</span><span>  tion  of  ""  loaves  and  fishes  ""  in  the</span><span>  immediate  future.  May  the  scene  to</span><span>  them  not  be,  perhaps,  delusive;  and  may</span><span>  not  these  pure  patriots  be  eventually</span><span>  found  silent,  crushed  underneath  their</span><span>  own  mighty  ""  rocks  I""  This  will  soon</span></p> <p><span>  be  decided,  and  the  question  of.</span><span>  ""  advancement  or  stagnation  ""  for  a  time</span></p> <p><span>  settled.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  Customs  collections  at  this  port  for</span><span>  tho  week  ending  April  21,  amounted  to  £2469</span></p> <p><span>  17s.

It  appears  that  at  about  seven</span><span>  o'clock  on  Friday  evening  a  man  named</span><span>  Victor  Mischka,  about  twenty-three  years  of</span><span>  age,  was  endeavouring  to  split  a  log  of  timber</span><span>  with  dynamite,  which  he  placed  on  the  top</span><span>  of  the  log,  and  built  in  with  clay.  He</span><span>  then  set  fire  to  it  with  a  match,  but</span><span>  it  exploded,  striking  him  in  the  eyes,</span><span>  face,  and  chest.  The  unfortunate  fellow</span><span>  ran  about  thirty  yards,  shouting  the  while,</span><span>  and  then  fell  to  the  ground.  His  mate  went</span><span>  to  his  assistance,  and  with  some  water  bathed</span><span>  his  face.  Mischka  at  the  time  was  bleeding</span><span>  from  the  eyes,  mouth,  and  chest.  Tarnetski</span><span>  thought  it  best  to  bring  him  to  the  hospital</span><span>  here.  He  placed  the  sufferer  in  his  cart,  and,</span><span>  in  company  with  his  wife,  started,  but  when</span><span>  about  four  miles  from  town  Mischka  expired.</span><span>  The  body  was  taken  to  the  dead-house  at  the</span><span>  Hospital  where  it  was  examined  by  Dr.</span><span>  Callahan  and  Dr.  Thurston,  the  first-named</span><span>  giving  a  certificate  to  the  effect  that  death  was</span><span>  caused  by  a  shock  to  the  system  induced  by</span><span>  the  firing  of  some  explosive  substance  near  the</span><span>  body.

We</span><span>  have  a  river  which  can  be  made  navigable  for</span><span>  the  largest  vessels.  3rd.  We  have  a  great</span><span>  pastoral  back  country  producing  wool</span><span>  and  beef  in  abundance.  4th.  We  have</span><span>  a  complete  circle  of  auriferous  reefs</span><span>  that  are  proved  to  be  highly  payable.</span><span>  6th.  Extensive  alluvial  auriferous  deposits</span><span>  which  are  also  proved  to  be  payable.  6th.</span><span>  We  have  many  thousands  of  acres  of  rich</span><span>  Buger  land.  AU  these  known  sources  of</span><span>  wealth  remain,  comparatively  speaking,  un-</span><span>  tapped.</span></p> <p><span>  Last,  though  not  least,  we  have,  if  Mr.</span><span>  Tenison-Wood  is  correct  in  interpreting  the</span><span>  testimony  of  the  rock,  vast  and  rich  coal</span><span>  deposits  of  the  best  description.  Mr.  Wood</span><span>  expresses  his  opinion  that  ""  the  advantage  of</span><span>  a  sufficient  local  supply  are  BO  manifest  that  it</span><span>  must  stimulate  enterprise  sufficiently  to  reveal</span><span>  some  of  the  many  rich  seams  which  the</span><span>  district  undoubtedly  possesses.""  In  conclusion</span><span>  he  says  that  ""  when  thia  is  accomplished  the</span><span>  cheap  working  of  the  line  will  be  accompanied</span><span>  by  a  great  stride  in  the  commercial  prosperity</span><span>  of  the  oentral  districts  of  Queensland.  Well,</span><span>  sir,  as  to  the  stimulating  effeota  of  Mr.</span><span>  Tenison-Wood's  letter  I  hare  my  doubts,  as</span><span>  the  people  of  Rockhampton  take  a  deal  of</span><span>  stimulating  before  they  are  capable  of  action.</span><span>  Their  apathy  is  something  marvellous,  and</span><span>  they  seem  to  he  totally  incapable  of  turning</span><span>  their  grand  position  toacoount.</span></p> <p><span>  But  the  cause  of  this  insensibility  to  their</span><span>  own  interests  is  not  far  to  seek.  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  for  many  years  has  been  in  the</span><span>  garotting  grip  of  the  so-called  Liberal  party,</span><span>  which  has  paralysed  alt  her  energies,  and  she</span><span>  has  been  handed  over  by  that  bigottcd  party  a</span><span>  helpless  vietim  to  the  selfishness  of  Queen</span><span>  street  politicians.</span></p> <p><span>  Under  the  M'llwraith  Ministry  «110  bas</span><span>  shown  symptoms  of  reviving  lifo.  Such</span><span>  stimulants  as  the  three  million  loan,  and  the</span><span>  mail  contract  have  had  a  wonderful  effect,</span><span>  and  hare  enabled  her  to  struggle  to  release</span><span>  herself  from  this  terrible  grip.  The  election</span><span>  of  Mr.  Ferguson  two  years  ago  was  the  first</span><span>  sign  of  returning  life,  and  the  defeat  of  Mr.</span><span>  Paterson  in  the  late  eleotion  still  further</span><span>  loosened  the  grip  upon  her  throat.</span></p> <p><span>  But  to  return  to  Mr.  Wood's  letter.  He</span><span>  proposes  the  diamond  drill,  and  indicates</span><span>  where  it  should  he  used  to  prove  the  accuracy</span><span>  of  his  scientific  knowledge.  Now,  the  dia-</span><span>  mond  drill  was  made  a  great  point  of  in  the</span><span>  addresses  during  the  election  by  both  our</span><span>  members,  and  it  ie  to  bs  hoped  that  Mr.</span><span>  Wood's  letter  will  stimulate  them  to  procure</span><span>  from  the  Government  this  necessary  machine</span><span>  to  quickly  bring  to  light  the  great  sou  roe  of</span><span>  wealth  and  prosperity  that  lie  hidden  beneath</span><span>  the  stratified  rocks.</span></p> <p><span>  But  why  wait  for  the  slow  process  of</span><span>  Government,  and  why  should  not  the  mer-</span><span>  chants  aud  capitalists  of  Rockhampton  put</span><span>  their  own  shoulders  to  the  wheel,  and  form</span><span>  a  Diamond  Drill  Company,  and  proceed  at</span><span>  once  to  action.  Surely,  under  the  Mineral</span><span>  Lands  Act,  they  could  secure  to  themselves</span><span>  any  discoveries  they  might  bring  to  light.</span><span>  Yet,  perhaps,  they  arc  afflicted  with  the  com-</span><span>  munist  mania-that  the  Government  should</span><span>  have  everything,  be  everything,  and  do  every-</span><span>  thing,  to  the  total  extinction  of  all  private</span><span>  enterprise.  Carry  ont  the  assigned  reasons</span><span>  for  this  supposed  proper  function  of  Govern-</span><span>  ment  to  their  logical  issue  (that  is-if  it  pays</span><span>  companies  to  construct  railways,  &c,  why</span><span>  should  not  the  Government  do  it  instead  and</span></p> <p><span>  reap  the  profitB)  we  shall  soon  have  the</span><span>  Government  oar  sole  bankers,  butchers,</span><span>  bakers,  and  barbers,  fcc.,  which  state  of</span><span>  things  I  think  most  people  would  denounce  as</span><span>  preposterously  absurd.</span></p> <p><span>  I  am,  &c,</span></p> <p><span>  ANTI.HCHBUO.</span></p> <p><span>  Rockhampton,  September  3,  1883.</span></p> ",Article,1883-09-05,ADVANCE ROCKHAMPTON.

The  Lake's</span><span>  Creek  Works  had  come  to  be  regarded</span><span>  as  the  most  complete  of  thc  kind  in</span><span>  Australia,  il  not,  indeed,  in  the  world.</span><span>  At  the  expenditure  of  a  large  amount  of</span><span>  capital,  and  by  the  application  of  technical</span><span>  knowledge,  gained  by  long  experience</span><span>  and  observation,  they  had  been  placed  in</span></p> <p><span>  a  state  of  increased  efficiency,  not  only  j</span><span>  for  the  purpose  of  carrying  on  the  meat</span><span>  preserving  business,  but  for  entering  on</span></p> <p><span>  the  Frozen  Meat  Trade.  Shortly  after  ]</span><span>  midnight  on  Thursday  morning  the  cry</span><span>  of  fire  was  raised  at  the  works,  and  at</span><span>  daybreak  the  long  range  of  worskshops</span><span>  was  a  mass  of  smoking  ruins.  In</span><span>  accordance  with  the  practice  he  had  fol-</span><span>  lowed  on  former  occasions  the  watch-</span><span>  man  of  the  works  had  gone  at  an  early</span><span>  hour  on  Thursday  morning,  and  kindled</span><span>  the  fire  under  a  vat  or  boiler  ia  which  fat</span><span>  had  to  be  melted.  Having  done  so  he</span><span>  went  about  his  other  duties,  anticipating</span><span>  that  the  vat  would  be  attended  to</span></p> <p><span>  by  the  workman  whose  business  it  was</span><span>  lo  look  after  it.  By  some  accident  the</span><span>  fat  became  overheated,  overflowed  the</span><span>  vessels  in  which  il  was  contained,</span><span>  caught  fire,  and  flowed  in  a  stream  of</span></p> <p><span>  flame  along  the  concrete  floor  of  the</span><span>  building.  The  flames  quickly  caught</span><span>  the  timber  weatherboards  composing  the</span><span>  sides  ol  the  building,  and  these  being</span><span>  extremely  dry  and  more  or  less  smeared</span><span>  with  grease,  fell  a  ready  prey  to  the</span><span>  devouring  element.  One  who  was</span><span>  present,  and  witnessed  thc  progress  of</span><span>  the  conflagration,  s.iys  the  fire  licked  up</span><span>  the  houses  as  if  they  had  been  a  sheet</span><span>  of  paper.  Vile  long  range  of  shops</span><span>  whicli  stood  parallel  to  the  river  became</span><span>  a  mass  of  fire.  A  small  portion  of  their</span><span>  contents  were  saved,  but  only  amid</span><span>  danger  and  risk.</span></p> <p><span>  Upon  a  rough  calculation  the  Direc-</span></p> <p><span>  tors  have  estimated  the  value  of  the  j</span><span>  propetty  destroyed  at  about  thirty  thou</span></p> <p><span>  sand  pounds.  One  half  of  that  will  be</span><span>  covered  by  insurance,  but  the  remaining</span><span>  half  will  fall  upon  the  company.  Largt</span><span>  as  is  this  loss  it  constitutes  but  one</span><span>  element  in  the  misfortune,  the  magnitude</span><span>  of  which  arises  from  the  effect  the  stop-</span><span>  page  of  the  works  will  have  on  the</span><span>  rising  meat  trade  of  the  colony;</span><span>  on  the  pastoral  interests  of  this  district  ;</span><span>  on  the  leading  local  industry  of  this</span><span>  locality  ;  and  on  the  trade  of  the  town.</span></p> <p><span>  With  regard  to  the  first  the  occurrence</span><span>  is  particularly  unfortunate.  After  many</span><span>  years  of  anxious  endeavour  to  gain</span><span>  that  place  for  our  preserved  meals  in</span><span>  the  markets  of  Europe  to  which  they</span><span>  are  entitled,  they  were  beginning  to</span><span>  command  a  more  ready  and  extensive</span><span>  sale.  A  great  impetus  has  been  given</span><span>  to  the  trade  by  the  receipt  of  a  large</span></p> <p><span>  order  from  the  French  Government.  It</span></p> <p><span>  had  been  satisfactorily  executed,  the  last</span><span>  cases  being  those  on  board  the  Ranelagh</span><span>  when  she  sank  in  the  river  last  week.</span><span>  Possibly  a  new  contract  might  have  been</span><span>  entered  into  had  the  Company  been  able</span><span>  to  fulfil  it.  In  the  meantime  they  will</span><span>  not  be  in  a  position  to  accept  any</span><span>  large  orders  for  at  least  six  months  to</span><span>  come.  Then,  again,  the  trade  with</span><span>  Batavia,  to  which  other  than  the</span><span>  directors  of  this  company  have  been</span><span>  looking  forward  with  many  hopeful  ex-</span><span>  pectations,  will  be  nipped  in  the  bud.</span><span>  The  Fiado,  had  been  chartered  by  the</span><span>  E.  and  A.  Fresh  Meat  Company  of</span><span>  Melbourne,  to  take  2400  quarters  of</span><span>  frozen  beef  from  the  works  to  Singapore  ;</span><span>  about  three  fourths  of  the  quantity  was</span><span>  ready  for  her  ;  but  she  was  nearly  a  fort-</span><span>  night  behind  time,  and  only  arrived  here</span><span>  yesterday  morning-too  late  to  receive</span><span>  the  cargo  prepared  for  her.  Orders  for</span><span>  preserved  meals  for  home  consumption,</span><span>  and  supplies  for  agents  in  London  and</span><span>  elsewhere  will  necessarily  be  interrupted  :</span></p> <p><span>  and  for  a  time  the  meat  trade  of  the</span><span>  colony  will  be  practically  suspended.</span></p> <p><span>  This  circumstance  will  not  fail  to  tell  on</span></p> <p><span>  it  in  future,  and  considerable  efforts  may</span><span>  be  required  to  raise  itto  the  same  degree</span><span>  of  prosperity.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  cattle  trade  of  the  district  the</span><span>  cessation  of  the  steady  certain  demand</span><span>  for  fat  stock  will  also  have  a  consider-</span></p> <p><span>  able  influence.  A  gentleman  intimately</span><span>  and  practically  connected  with  the  trade</span><span>  calculates  that  the  Lake's  Creek  works</span><span>  have  heen  the  means,  while  in  active</span><span>  operation,  of  raising  the  price  of  cattle</span><span>  in  this  district  to  tire  extent  of  ten  shil</span><span>  a  head  on  the  average.  As  illustrative</span><span>  of  the  transactions  in  which  the  Com-</span><span>  pany  engaged,  we  may  mention  that</span><span>  Mr.  William  Pattison  was  under  con-</span><span>  tract  to  supply  them  with  upwards</span><span>  of  2500  head.  Nearly  the  whole  of</span><span>  these  had  been  delivered.  The  turn-</span></p> <p><span>  over  of  capital  in  the  course  of  a  season,</span><span>  we  have  it  on  good  authority,  amounts</span><span>  to  two  hundred  thousand  pounds.  For-</span><span>  tunately  the  loss  in  this  connection  will</span><span>  not  be  great,  as  the  supply  of  fat  cattle</span><span>  in  the  district  has  been  well  nigh  ex-</span><span>  hausted,  and  the  state  of  the  country</span><span>  will  prevent  those  at  a  distance  from</span><span>  travelling.  Before  stock  are  again  in</span><span>  the  market  there  is  a  prospect,  we  are</span><span>  glad  to  learn,  that  the  Works  will  be  in</span><span>  full  working  order.</span></p> <p><span>  In  this  town  the  greatest  sympathy</span><span>  will  be  felt  for  the  operatives  and  others</span><span>  employed  at  the  works.  By  their</span><span>  suspension  upwards  of  two  hundred</span></p> <p><span>  bread-winners  will  be  thrown  out  of</span><span>  employment.  Many  of  them  have  been</span><span>  long  engaged  in  the  establishment,  and</span><span>  while  acquiring  skill  and  facility  in  the</span><span>  performance  of  special  duties  required</span></p> <p><span>  of  them  have  become  unfitted  lo  some</span></p> <p><span>  extent  for  other  pursuits.  They  cannot,</span><span>  therefore,  turn  their  hands  readily  to</span><span>  such  other  work  as  may  be  available  for</span><span>  them.  Then  there  was  a  large  staff  of</span><span>  tinsmiths,  including  a  contingent  who</span><span>  recently  arrived  from  Scotland  under</span><span>  special  agreement.  Their  occupation  is</span><span>  in  the  meantime  gone.  The  wages-bill</span><span>  of  the  works  ranged  from  j£soa  t0  £%5°</span></p> <p><span>  a  week.</span></p> <p><span>  As  the  greater  portion  of  the  sum  we</span><span>  have  just  mentioned  was  spent  in  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  it  is  evident  the  effect  of  the</span><span>  suspension  of  the  industry  on  the  retail</span></p> <p><span>  trade  of  this  town  will  be  consider-</span><span>  able.  For  a  time  at  least  the  absence  of</span><span>  Lake's  Creek  customers  will  effect  the</span><span>  weekly  drawings  of  most  of  our  shop-</span><span>  keepers.</span></p> <p><span>  With  very  great  satisfaction  the  public</span></p> <p><span>  will  learn  that  the  directors  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Company  have  not  been  completely</span><span>  overwhelmed  by  the  disaster.  They</span><span>  take  a  hopeful  view  of  the  situation,  and</span><span>  have  resolved  on  a  course  of  action</span><span>  creditable  alike  to  their  intelligence  and</span><span>  public  spirit.  At  a  meeting  held  yester-</span><span>  day  afternoon  they  resolved  to  call  up  all</span><span>  the  funds  they  can,  to  issue  new  stock,</span></p> <p><span>  and  lo  make  an  effort  to  have  the  works</span></p> <p><span>  going  again  in  six-months.  It  is  to  be</span><span>  hoped  that  all  who  have  the  means  at</span><span>  their  command  will  aid  them  in  carrying</span><span>  out  this  resolution,  so  that  the  town  and</span><span>  district  will  soon  recover  from  the  effects</span><span>  of  this  sudden  public  disaster.</span></p> ",Article,1883-09-14,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  OCTOBER  9,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THE'last  quarterly  statement  that  will  be</span><span>  issued  by  Mr.  Archer,  as  the  Treasurer</span><span>  of  the  present  Ministry,  vf  as  published</span><span>  in  the  Gazette  last  week.  It  affords  a</span><span>  striking  contrast,  indeed,  to  their  first</span><span>  quarterly  statement,  which  showed  a  fast</span><span>  accumulating  expenditure  and  a  failing</span><span>  revenue,  and  which  was  issued  at  a  time</span><span>  when  the  colony  was  in  the  depths  of  a</span><span>  depression.  We  are  not  among  those</span><span>  blind  supporters  of  the  present  Govern-</span><span>  ment  who  think  that  they  restored  the</span><span>  condition  of  the  public  finances  as  by  a</span><span>  magician's  wand.  We  admit  that  the</span><span>  stagnant  period  of  1.874-9  was  in  a  great</span></p> <p><span>  measure  due  to  other  causes  than  in-</span><span>  efficient  administration.  But  we  do  con-</span><span>  tend  that  the  difficulties  of  the  situation</span><span>  were  aggravated  by  the  incapacity  of  the</span><span>  then  Government.  In  1874  the  session</span><span>  was  marked  by  a  perfectly  needless  and</span><span>  entirely  mischievous  alteration  of  the</span><span>  tariff,  and  by  an  attempt  to  resume  an</span><span>  area  of  land  altogether  in  excess  of  the</span><span>  demand  for  bona  fide  settlement.  In</span><span>  1875  the  timidity  of  the  Government  in</span><span>  the  matter  of  borrowing  induced  them</span><span>  to  pass  the  Western  Railway  Act,  under</span></p> <p><span>  which  it  was  intended  to  carry  out  the</span><span>  south-western  line  from  Dalby  to  Roma,</span><span>  and,  as  the  Central  line  could  not</span><span>  possibly  be  continued  on  the  same  prin-</span><span>  ciple,  to  provide  an  excuse  for  discon-</span><span>  tinuing  its  extension  altogether.  In  1S76</span><span>  the  Macalister  Ministry  broke  up  througli</span><span>  internal  dissension,  and  the  country  was</span><span>  precipitated  to  the  depth  of  humiliation</span><span>  by  the  appointment  of  the  Thorn</span><span>  Ministry,  while  confidence  was  seriously</span><span>  shaken  by  the  Settled  Districts  Leases</span><span>  Act,  the  Railway  Reserves  Act,  and  the</span><span>  six-in-a-block  scheme  of  railways.  In</span><span>  1877  the  spectacle  of  a  colony  governed</span><span>  by  a  ""  nominal  Premier  ""  was  continued,</span><span>  and  universal  distrust  resulted  from  the</span><span>  dread  of  further  heroic  legislation  by  a</span><span>  Ministry  whose  sole  hope  of  retaining</span><span>  power  by  in  their  ability  to  dazzle  the</span><span>  popular  imagination  and  to  set  class</span><span>  against  class.  In  1S78  the  country  was</span><span>  governed  by  the  Opposition,  who  emas-</span><span>  culated  the  great  measure  of  the  session</span><span>  -the  Redistribution  of  Electorates  Bill</span><span>  -compelled  the  Ministry  to  pass  the</span><span>  Local  Government  Lill,  and  showed</span><span>  their  power  by  voting  ,£44,000  for</span><span>  roads  and  bridges  in  the  teeth  of  the</span><span>  Government,  whose  duty  it  was  to  pro-</span><span>  tect  thc  Treasury.  And  that  Govern-</span><span>  ment  consented  to  retain  office  for  six</span><span>  months  after  they  had  been  shown  their</span><span>  utter  powerlessness  to  guide  thc  Legisla-</span><span>  ture.  All  these  events  undoubtedly  con-</span><span>  tributed  to  the  destruction  of  public</span><span>  confidence,  and  discouraged  capitalists</span><span>  from  engaging  in  new  industrial  enter-</span><span>  prises.</span></p> <p><span>  It  wa=;  in  this  state  of  r.ffjirs  that  the</span><span>  M'llwraiih  Ministry  took  office,  and</span><span>  courageously  f.iced  the  public  odium</span><span>  attendant  upon  ,i  policy  of  retrenchment.</span><span>  They  made  some  mistakes  in  enforcing</span><span>  this  policy,  one  of  these  being  the  sum-</span><span>  mary  dismissal  of  over  100  men  fruin</span><span>  the  Ipswich  workshops.  This  and</span></p> <p><span>  many  other  stern  lessons  in  economy  I</span><span>  produced  great  discomfurt  at  first,  but</span><span>  the  session  of  1S79  did  much  to</span></p> <p><span>  re-eslablish  public  confidence.  It</span><span>  proved  that  thc  colony  was  no  longer</span><span>  ruled  by  a  ministry  of  expediency,  but</span><span>  liv  men  who  had  well-defined  opinions,</span><span>  the  courage  of  their  convictions,  and  the</span><span>  determination  to  legislate  and  administer</span><span>  for  the  benefit  of  the  colony  rather  than</span><span>  lo  appease  public  clamour.  They</span><span>  entered  upon  their  second  year  with</span><span>  slightly  more  encouraging  prospects,  and</span><span>  by  its  close  they  had  the  satisfaction  of</span></p> <p><span>  demonstrating  that  distrust  had  been,</span><span>  displaced  by  confidence,  and  adversity</span><span>  by  prosperity.  Since  then  progress  has</span><span>  continued  to  an  unprecedented  extent,</span></p> <p><span>  until  in  the  transactions  of  the  two  years;</span><span>  which  closed  on  30th  June  last  the</span><span>  combined  surpluses  had  amounted  to</span><span>  ¿¿558.00o.  As  in  the  two  preceding</span><span>  years  the  deficits  had  amounted  -  to  two</span><span>  thirds  of  that  sum  the  change  that  had</span><span>  occurred  was  almost  unparalleled  ;  and,,</span><span>  we  repeat,  although  not  entirely  due  to</span><span>  good  Government  was  largely  assisted</span><span>  by  that  very  substantial  boon.</span></p> <p><span>  But  the  Ministry  has  outlived  its  use-</span><span>  fulness-at  least  that  is  the  verdict  just</span><span>  given  by  the  constituencies-and  the</span><span>  time  has  come  when  they  must,  for  a</span><span>  period  at  least,  give*place  to  other  men.</span><span>  The  Liberal  Patty  led  by  Mr.  Griffith</span><span>  has  been  purged  of  its  contempt  by  a</span><span>  five  years'  residence  in  the  cold  shade  ;</span><span>  and  the  general  hope  is  that  they  will</span><span>  have  so  far  profitted  by  the  discipline</span><span>  they  have  undergone  as  to  be  worthy  of</span><span>  again  sitting  on  the  Treasury  Benches.</span><span>  For  ourselves,  however,  we  cannot  con-</span><span>  fess  to  much  confidence  in  the  Coming</span><span>  Men.  They  have  done  so  badly  in</span><span>  Opposition  that  we  can  scarcely  expect  to</span><span>  find  them  do  well  in  power.  Mr.  Griffith</span></p> <p><span>  excepted,  there  is  not  a  competent</span><span>  debater  in  the  party.  Pollysyllabti  Mr.</span><span>  Dickson  has  not  the  ear  of  the  House  ;</span><span>  ranting  Mr.  Rutledge  has  the  ear  but</span><span>  not  the  understanding  or  sympathy  ;</span><span>  venomous  Mr.  Miles'  oratory  is  inarticu-</span><span>  late  and  largely  composed  of  wise</span><span>  shakings  of  (he  head  ;  gurrilous  Mr.</span><span>  Groom  so  habitually  draws  the  long</span></p> <p><span>  bow  as  to  be  the  victim  of  incredulous</span><span>  audiences  ;  while  such  geniuses  of</span><span>  disorder  as  Brookes,  Isambert,  and</span><span>  Kellet,  can  be  no  help  to  any  political</span><span>  party.  The  country,  we  are  sure,  has</span><span>  no  faith  in  these  men,  and  were  not</span><span>  Mr.  Griffith  an  unquestioned  lawyer  of</span><span>  mark,  his  party  would  be  utterly  devoid</span><span>  of  governing  qualifications.  We  must,</span><span>  however  await  events,  only  trusting  that</span><span>  the  feebleness  and  menaacity  of  the  last</span><span>  Liberal  administration  will  not  be  re-</span><span>  peated  in  the  Ministry  about  to  be</span></p> <p><span>  constituted.</span></p> <p><span>  But  to  our  muttons.  The  gross</span><span>  revenue  for  the  quarter  has  been  over</span><span>  ,£700,000  or  at  the  rate  of  .£2,800,000</span><span>  per  annum.  The  expenditure  has  been</span><span>  ,£407,000,  or  at  the  rate  of  over</span><span>  ,£1,600,000  per  annum.  Including  thc</span><span>  loan  and  special  disbursements  the</span><span>  outlay  for  the  quarter  was  ,£875,000,</span></p> <p><span>  or  over  three  and  a  half  millions</span></p> <p><span>  sterling  a  year.  This  for  a  popula-</span><span>  tion  not  exceeding  270,000  souls  is</span><span>  certainly  astounding.  The  revenue</span><span>  balance  to  credit  in  the  Treasury</span><span>  on  30th  September  was  .£013,500,  or,</span><span>  charaicß  it.Äith  ^7rfíq-,uuc/""-  thc  amount</span><span>  of  one  quarter's  interest  which  has  ac-</span><span>  crued  on  the  public  debt-a  net  balance</span><span>  of  ¿4S3i500-  With  such  a  surplus</span><span>  the  Ministry  ought  to  be  able  to  relin-</span><span>  quish  office  with  satisfaction  and  pride.</span></p> <p><span>  The  prosperity  of  the  colony  is  plainly</span><span>  evidenced  by  the  elasticity  of  taxation</span><span>  revenue  ;  by  the  large  augmentation  in</span><span>  pastoral  rents  ;  by  the  very  considerable</span><span>  increase  of  postal  and  telegraphic</span><span>  receipts  ;  and  by  the  rapidly  accumula-</span><span>  ting  earnings  of  the  various  railways.  On</span></p> <p><span>  the  Northern  line  the  increase  on  the</span><span>  corresponding  quarter  of  1882  was  over</span><span>  ,£16,000,  and  on  the  Central  line,</span><span>  despite  the  bad  season,  nearly  ,£4000.</span><span>  The  Maryborough  line  shows  an  increase</span><span>  of  nearly  50  per  cent,  while  the  Northern</span><span>  line  receipts  have  nearly  doubled.</span><span>  Having  achieved  so  much  in  their  five</span><span>  years'  term,  Ministers  may  well  retire  to</span><span>  rest  and  be  thankful  for  a  while.</span></p> ",Article,1883-10-09,"The Morning bulletin ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  KOCKUAMl'TON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  DECEMBER  12,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  AMONG  the  greatest  obstacles  to  progress</span><span>  of  lliis  colony  have  been  the  want  of</span><span>  labour,  and  the  utilisation  of  facilities</span><span>  for  its  distribution.  In  the  early  days  of</span><span>  the  colony,  when  the  convict  system  was</span><span>  still  in  operation,  free  emigrants  were  im-</span><span>  ported,  and  landed  at  Brisbane;  but</span><span>  their  ultimate  disposal  being  controlled</span><span>  by  the  Government  at  Brisbane  many  of</span><span>  them  were  conveyed  to  the  southern</span><span>  parts  ot  the  colony.  The  practice  then</span><span>  inaugurated,  of  subtracting  Queensland</span><span>  emigrants,  has  continued,  and  within  the</span><span>  last  few  weeks  has  again  attracted  pro-</span><span>  minent  attention.  How  far  the  reports</span><span>  which  have  been  raised  are  true,  and  the</span><span>  agitation  which  has  been  based  on  them</span><span>  is  warranted,  we  arc  not  in  the  position</span><span>  accurately  to  determine.  Of  this,  how-</span><span>  ever,  we  have  plain  evidence  on  the</span><span>  surface,  that  the  former  have  been  exag-</span><span>  gerated,  and  thc  latter  fostered  for</span><span>  political  purposes.  There  has  always</span><span>  been  a  considerable  amount  of</span><span>  intercourse  between  this  colony  and</span><span>  New  South  Wales.  It  must  be  difficult</span><span>  to  determine  the  number  of  persons  who</span><span>  leave  for  good,  and  of  those  who  come</span><span>  here  to  take  up  their  residence.  From</span><span>  the  Statistics  of  the  Colony,  we  learn</span><span>  that  the  number  of  persons  who  arrived</span><span>  at  the  various  ports  in  the  colony  in</span><span>  1882  was  27,000,  or  17,043  mote  than</span><span>  left  the  ports.  The  number  who  left</span><span>  was  9957,  and  7307  persons  went  to</span><span>  New'Souih  Wales.  But  there  arrived,</span><span>  within  thc  same  period,  from  the  older</span><span>  colony  9552.  It  thus  appears  that  from</span><span>  the  adjacent  country  as  many  people</span><span>  came  to  Queensland  as  left  it  for  all</span><span>  countries.  The  balance  of  intercourse</span><span>  is  thus  seen  to  have  been  greatly  in</span><span>  favour  of  this  colony.  Recently  the</span><span>  cry  has  been  raised  that  there  was  a</span><span>  great  exodus  of  newly-arrived  immigrants</span><span>  going  on  ;  that  they  were  crowding</span></p> <p><span>  over  the  border  of  New  South</span></p> <p><span>  Wales,  near  Stanthorpe  ;  and  swell-</span><span>  ing  the  passenger  traffic  on  board</span><span>  the  coasting  steamers.  Notwithstanding</span><span>  the  amount  of  writing  that  has  taken</span><span>  place  on  the  subject,  there  is  nothing  to</span><span>  show  that  the  departures  have  been</span><span>  greater  than  usual,  or  that  they  are  out</span><span>  of  proportion  to  the  number  of  persons,</span><span>  who  have  recently  arrived  in  the  colony.</span><span>  It  always  has  been  the  case  that  people</span><span>  came  here  under  our  free  emigration</span><span>  system,  with  the  object  ol  levanting  at</span><span>  the  first  opportunity  to  ¡oin  their  friends</span><span>  in  New  South  Wales.  The  fact  has</span><span>  been  well  known,  and  has  formed  the</span><span>  subject  of  comment  in  Parliament.</span><span>  When  tliî  last  Immigration  Bill  was</span><span>  under  discussion  clauses  were  inserted,</span><span>  imposing  severe  penalties  0/1  persons,</span><span>  who,  having  come  out  assisted  under  our</span><span>  Immigration  system,  should,  within  a</span><span>  certain  period,  attempt  lo  leave  the</span><span>  colony.  These  clauses  were  modified</span><span>  by  the  Iben  Leader  of  the  Opposition,</span></p> <p><span>  but  it  was  thought  they  were  still  suffi-</span><span>  ciently  stringent  to  restrain  those</span><span>  who  came  here  only  lo  leave  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  adjacent  colonies.  It  is  a  signifi-  j</span><span>  cant  fid  that  no  attempt  has  |</span><span>  been  made  by  the  Government  to</span><span>  enforce  thc  penal  provisions  of  the</span><span>  statute.  When  thc  outcry  was  raised</span><span>  about  the  departuies  of  immigrants,  an</span><span>  official  in  (he  Immigration  Department  in-</span><span>  stituted  an  action  against  a  man  named</span><span>  Macartney  for  violating  the  law,  but  the</span><span>  ca*e  was  withdrawn,  as  it  had  not  been</span><span>  sanctioned  by  the  Colonial  Secretary.</span><span>  No  prosecutions  have  been  ordered,  and</span><span>  the  public  have  been  left  somewhat  at  a</span><span>  loss  how  lo  interpret  the  state  of  affairs.</span><span>  Klher  the  penal  clauses  of  the  Immi-</span><span>  gration  Act  are  of  no  avail  in  checking</span><span>  the  departure  of  our  new  chums,  or  the</span><span>  number  is  not  nearly  so  great  as  has  been</span></p> <p><span>  reported,  or  the  number  of  persons</span><span>  corning  from  Sydney  is  equal  to  that  of</span><span>  those  departing.</span></p> <p><span>  What  is  greatly  to  be  deplored  in</span><span>  connection  with  the  recent  agitation  in</span><span>  Brisbane  was  its  party  character.  The</span><span>  actual  agents  in  it  were  the  unwitting</span><span>  tools  of  political  wire  pullers.  Imme-</span><span>  diately  upon  the  accession  of  the  present</span><span>  Government  to  office,  and  when  the</span><span>  public  were  on  the  gui  rive  as  to  the</span><span>  revelations  that  might  be  expected  in</span><span>  fulfilment  of  promises  made,  the  press</span><span>  organ  of  the  Queen-street  party  came</span><span>  out  with  a  shrieking  paragraph  about  the</span><span>  way  in  which  money  was  being  squan-</span><span>  dered  on  immigration.  There  happened</span><span>  to  be  a  glut  of  men  at  the  Immigration</span><span>  Depot  at  the  time.  Some  of  these  men,</span><span>  and  idlers,  who  are  always  ready  to</span><span>  raise  their  voices  when  the  question  of</span><span>  wages  is  concerned,  took  up  the  cry  o</span><span>  too  much  labour.  It  is  always  agreeable</span><span>  to  the  latter,  when  they  can  earn.  as</span><span>  much  money  in  a  few  days  as  will  enable</span></p> <p><span>  them  to  loaf  about  the  rest  of  the  week.</span></p> <p><span>  They  are  of  the  same  mind  as  the  wharf</span><span>  lumpers  at  Sydney,  wbo  would  like  to</span><span>  see  immigration  stopped,  though  the</span><span>  whole  of  the  inland  districts  should  be</span><span>  starving  for  labour.  Among  these  dis-</span><span>  contented  people  the  flame  lit  by  the</span><span>  Liberal  organ  burnt  freely,  and</span><span>  was  cleverly  fanned.  A  députa</span></p> <p><span>  lion  to  the  Governor  was  orga-,</span><span>  nised,  but  he  referred  those  who</span><span>  wished  to  wait  upon  him  to  the</span><span>  Immigration  Board,  by  whom  they  were</span><span>  softened  with  promises  of  work  from</span><span>  the  Government.  With  this  they  seemed</span><span>  to  be  quite  satisfied,  and  no  more  com-</span><span>  plaints  were  heard.  That  the  latter</span></p> <p><span>  were  such  as  are  common  to  new</span></p> <p><span>  chums  on  their  arrival  in  this  colony  has</span><span>  become  obvious.  Single  men  and  girls</span><span>  have  been  rapidly  absorbed  in  the</span><span>  population.  Orders  for  men  to  go  out</span><span>  west  have  since  been  sent  to  Brisbane,</span><span>  which  it  is  found  impossible  to  fulfil.</span><span>  Men  with  large  families  will  not  go  out</span><span>  into  the  country,  nor  will  mechanics.</span></p> <p><span>  Whether  these  people  or  the  Immigration  i</span><span>  Agents  are  most  to  blame  is  an  open</span><span>  question.  In  the  meantime  the  rapid</span></p> <p><span>  relief  the  labour  market  has  received,  '</span><span>  since  the  agitation  arose,  shows  that  it</span><span>  was  to  a  large  extent  artificial.  This</span><span>  effort  to  secure  political  capital  by</span><span>  pandering  to  a  class,  docs  not  reflect</span><span>  credit  on  the  Liberal  Press,  which  has</span><span>  been  rather  too  keen  in  this  instance.</span></p> ",Article,1883-12-12,"The Morning Bulletin.

"<p><span>  ROCK  I  IA  MITON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  FEBRUARY  14,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  FROM  a  remark  made  by  Mr.  Ferguson</span><span>  the  other  day,  at  a  meeting  of  the  Cham-</span><span>  ber  of  Commerce,  we  are  very  glad  to</span><span>  find  he  is  of  opinion  the  time  cannot  be</span><span>  far  distant  when  the  management  of  our</span><span>  harbour  affairs  must  be  placed  in  the</span><span>  hands  of  local  trustees.  This  opinion,</span><span>  we  know,  is  held  by  the  Chairman  of</span><span>  the  Divisional  Board,  and  it  will,  we</span><span>  doubt  not,  be  adopted  by  all  who  recog-</span><span>  nise  the  advantages  of  local  government.</span><span>  Sir  Thomas  Mcilwraith,  when  discussing</span><span>  the  Port  Ainu  Railway  Question,  stated</span><span>  plainly  that  it  would  require  to  be  con-</span><span>  structed  by  private  parties,  because  it</span><span>  would  be  vain  to  ask  Parliament  to  do</span><span>  so,  and  at  same  time  carry  on  the  river</span><span>  works  :  and  if  we  urgently  demanded</span><span>  the  former  wc  must  abandon  (he  latter.</span><span>  Indeed,  he  hinted  that  the  latter  must</span><span>  be  suspended,  because  there  were  not</span><span>  funds  io  cirry  them  on  promptly.  The</span><span>  works  on  the  Fitzroy  River  have  been</span><span>  regarded  as  unremuneralive,  and  hence</span><span>  the  difficulty  about  completing  them.</span><span>  At  that  time  it  does  not  seem  lo  have</span><span>  occurred  to  the  Premier  that  an  organisa-</span><span>  tion  might  be  created  which  should  be</span><span>  able,  with  a  lillie  assistance,  to  Telieve</span><span>  tho  central  authority  of  all  trouble  and</span><span>  responsibility  with  regard  to  our  har-</span><span>  bour.  Al  present  thc  Harbours  Dop.nl</span><span>  nient  of  liie  Government  is  not  popular.</span><span>  It  seems  to  be  over-burdened  with</span><span>  work,  and  hampered  by  officialism.</span><span>  The  Fitzroy  River,  for  more  than  a  year,</span><span>  has  been  completely  neglected.  The</span><span>  old  dredger  was  employed,  and  s  steady</span><span>  clïort  mule  to  cut  a  ship  channel</span><span>  through  the  Upper  Flats.  Just  when</span><span>  the  latter  work  had  been  completed,  and</span></p> <p><span>  there  was  a  prospect  ol  the  channel</span><span>  being  greatly  improved  by  a  little  cutting</span><span>  at  the  crossings,  the  dredger  was  with-</span><span>  drawn,  and  the  shallow  sandy  bars  ate</span><span>  allowed  to  remain,  to  the  obstruction  of</span><span>  all  navigation.  The  growing  increase  of</span><span>  traffic  on  the  river,  proves  the  necessity</span><span>  for  the  improvement  of  the  navigation,</span><span>  yet  our  merchants  and  shippers,  who  are</span><span>  immediately  and  deeply  interested  can</span><span>  do  nothing  to  mend  matters.</span></p> <p><span>  Then  again,  our  swelling  trade  has  led</span><span>  to  a  demand  being  made  for  enlarged</span><span>  wharfage  accommodation.  It  has  been</span><span>  proposed  that  a  floating  wharf  should  be</span><span>  constructed,  so  as  to  be  available  at  all</span><span>  states  of  the  tide,  and  by  sea-going</span><span>  vessels.  An  extension  of  the  existing</span><span>  wharves  has  also  been  suggested,  with</span><span>  the  object  of  giving  accommodation  to</span><span>  shipping,  and  protecting  the  river  bank.</span><span>  The  Chamber  of  Commerce  including</span><span>  our  leading  commercial  men,  see  the</span><span>  necessity  for  these  improvements,  but  all</span><span>  they  can  do  in  the  matter  is  to  go  to</span><span>  the  Town  Council,  hat  in  hand,  and</span><span>  respectfully  solicit  the  Corporation  to</span><span>  undertake  the  new  works.  If  our  Muni-</span><span>  cipal  authorities  treat  the  subject  as  they</span><span>  have  done  the  Baths  Question,  it  may</span><span>  be  a  very  long  time  before  the  wishes  of</span><span>  the  parties  interested  are  attended  to.</span><span>  The  Council  must  calculate  whether  the</span><span>  works  will  pay-whether  they  will  yield  a</span><span>  revenue,  not  only  sufficient  to  meet  the</span><span>  interest  on  the  outlay  for  the  works,  but</span><span>  give  a  profit  to  the  corporation.  We</span><span>  have  thus  the  curious  spectacle  of  the</span><span>  merchants  and  ship-owners,  who  are</span><span>  directly  interested  in  the  maintenance  of</span><span>  the  river  navigation,  and  ample  wharfage</span><span>  accommodation,  impeded,  on  the  one</span><span>  hand  by  the  laxity  and  carelessness  of</span><span>  thc  Government  and  their  officials,  and</span><span>  on  the  other  by  the  dilatoriness  and</span><span>  money-making  spirit  of  the  Town</span><span>  Council.  The  crutches  on  which  com-</span><span>  merce  depends  are  both  unreliable.</span></p> <p><span>  In  these  circumstances  the  desirability</span><span>  of  forming  a  Harbour  Trust,  to  take</span><span>  charge  of  all  matters  connected  with  the</span><span>  shipping  interests,  seems  obvious.  There</span><span>  cannot  be  the  least  doubt,  we  think,  that</span><span>  if  the  maintenance  of  the  River  Works</span><span>  had  been  dependent  on  the  will  of</span><span>  the  commercial  men,  shipowners,  and</span><span>  steamship  agents  they  would  not  have</span><span>  been  neglected  as  they  have  been  during</span><span>  the  last  few  years.  If  we  want  a</span><span>  guarantee  that  the  present  system  of</span><span>  neglect  shall  not  prevail  in  future,  we</span><span>  must  have  a  local  harbour  trust.</span><span>  Brisbane  River  is  under  the  eye  of  the</span><span>  Government,  lt  may  be  regarded  as</span><span>  under  their  personal  supervision,  and</span><span>  malters  there  have  gone  on  smoothly.</span><span>  The  mail  steamers  can  now  be  taken</span><span>  up  to  the  town.  If  ever  deep-sea</span><span>  steamers  are  to  come  up  to  our</span><span>  wharves,  our  merchants  and  shipowners</span><span>  must  have  the  power  of  controlling</span><span>  harbour  affairs.  It  wilt  not  do  to  have</span><span>  the  river  works  neglected,  or  attended  to</span><span>  just  as  may  suit  the  interests  of  poli-</span><span>  ticians.  The  well-being  of  this  com-</span><span>  munity,  and,  indeed,  of  the  whole</span><span>  Central  Division,  depends  upon  our</span><span>  having  ample  and  convenient  shipping</span><span>  facilities,  and  these  ought  not  to  be</span><span>  made  or  marred  to  suit  party  purposes.</span><span>  So  long  as  the  present  system  of  harbour</span><span>  management  -  or  mismanagement  -</span><span>  remains,  we  have  no  protection  that</span><span>  this  will  not  be  the  case.  From  the</span><span>  past,  we  have  no  reason  to  form  any</span><span>  pleasant  anticipations  of  the  future.</span></p> <p><span>  A  Harbour  Trust,  composed  as  it</span><span>  should  be  of  persons  representative  of</span><span>  the  interests  involved,  would,  be</span><span>  eminently  practical  and  useful.  It</span><span>  should  include  members  representative</span><span>  of  the  shipping  and  commercial  in-</span><span>  terests  ;  of  the  Town  Council,  as</span><span>  curators  of  the  Municpal  property,  of</span><span>  the  Divisional  Board,  as  protectors  of</span><span>  the  northern  bank  of  the  river  ;  and  one</span><span>  or  two  representatives  of  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  in  the  event  of  the  Treasury  con-</span><span>  tributing  to  the  funds  of  the  Trust.  By</span><span>  such  a  board  the  interests  of  all  parties</span><span>  would  be  carefully  and  immediately</span><span>  attended  to.  If  wharfage  accom-</span><span>  modation  were  required  the  neces-</span><span>  sity  for  it  would  be  most  apparent</span><span>  to  the  members,  and  they  would  allow</span><span>  no  trifling  obstacles  or  considerations  to</span><span>  interfere  with  the  providing  of  it.  As</span><span>  they  would  be  rated  according  to  the</span><span>  amount  of  outlay  at  any  time  they</span><span>  would  be  very  careful  not  to  incur</span><span>  needless  expenditure  in  any  quarter.</span><span>  They  would  be  less  liable  to  squander</span><span>  funds  than  Government  officials.</span></p> <p><span>  ?It  will  be  argued  that  the  rates  de-</span><span>  rived  from  the  river  and  wharves  would</span><span>  would  not  be  sufficient  to  carry  out  the</span><span>  necessary  works  ;  and  that  to  complete</span><span>  Mr.  Nesbit's  scheme  of  river  improve-</span><span>  ment  would  require  all  the  funds</span><span>  that  could  be  raised  by  a  Hir</span><span>  bour  Trust.  There  is  no  doubt  the</span><span>  completion  of  these  works  would  require</span><span>  a  large  expenditure,  but  it  is  not  neces-</span><span>  sary  that  it  should  be  made  all  at  once.</span><span>  The  Harbour  Trust  would  have  a  large</span><span>  and  steady  revenue  from  tonnage  and</span><span>  wharfage  rates.  For  a  lime  thc  Govern-</span><span>  ment  could  -supplement  the  local  rates,  as</span><span>  il  does  those  of  municipalities  and  divi-</span><span>  sional  boards.  There  is  at  present  an</span><span>  unexpended  vote  of  about  twenty-six</span><span>  thousand  pounds  for  the  Fitzroy  River</span><span>  works  ;  and  thc  S.iui  ian,  which  is  now  at</span><span>  work  in  thc  Mary  River,  has  been  built</span><span>  for  thc  Fitzroy.  Were  the  Government</span><span>  to  hand  over  these  to  a  Harbour  Trust,</span><span>  and  endow  it  with  reasonable  powers</span><span>  of  assessment,  a  corporation  might</span><span>  be  created  that  would  be  of  the</span><span>  greatest  public  service.  It  would  relieve</span><span>  the  Government  of  works,  with  which,</span><span>  wc  think,  it  is  apparent  they  cannot  deal</span><span>  very  satisfactorily.  Their  past  manage-</span><span>  ment,  at  least,  has  been  far  from  success-</span><span>  ful.  A  Harbour  Trust,  moreover,</span><span>  composed  of  local  men  :  holding  its</span><span>  deliberations  in  this  town  ;  exposed  to</span><span>  the  criticism  and  comments  of  the  com-</span><span>  munity  ;  and  responsible  to  the  consti-</span><span>  tuency  for  its  actions  would  be  a  living,</span><span>  active  organisation  ;  and  not  a  dull  inert</span><span>  mass,-unapproachable,  difficult  to  move,</span><span>  like  that  under  which  our  harbour  affairs</span><span>  are  placed  at  present.</span></p> <p><span>  IT  will  be  remeirjlieruil  that  a  few  issues</span><span>  since  wo  notified  that  certain  ""  foreigners  ""</span><span>  [  who  had  been  paying  thiB  oity  a  professional</span></p> <p><span>  visit,  circulated  some  valueless  cheques  before</span><span>  leaving,  and  warrants  bad  been  taken  ont  for</span><span>  their  arrest.  Sinoe  euch  warrants  have  been</span><span>  signed,  nothing  baa  been  apparently  done  to</span><span>  bring  the  oulprits  to  justice.  We  have  been</span><span>  informed  that  on  tho  warrants  being  aent  to</span><span>  the  port  at  which  the  men  landed  who</span><span>  bad  attempted  to  defraud  oar  tradesmen,</span><span>  the  money,  for  the  payment  of  which  the</span><span>  cheques  bod  been  drawn,  waa  paid,  and  thus</span><span>  execution  al  the  warrants  stopped.  This  may</span></p> <p><span>  bo  perfectly  correct,  but  it  is  tho  first  instance</span><span>  that  has  come  under  our  notice  of  such  a</span><span>  method  of  proceeding.  When  the  cheques</span><span>  were  drawn  to  which  we  allude,  the  mau  who</span><span>  signed  them  cither  knew  that  at  the  time  they</span><span>  were  so  drawn,  they  were  or  were  not  good,</span><span>  and  valid  orders  for  the  payment  of  money,</span><span>  and  upon  this  issue  bo  should  have  been  tried.</span><span>  Tho  fact  of  his  willingness  to  pay  the  money</span><span>  when  aoutronted  with  a  warrant,  does  not  dis-</span><span>  prove  his  intent  to  defraud  at  the  time  he  drew</span><span>  ont  the  orders,  and  if  be  know  that  such  orders</span><span>  would  bo  dishonoured,  or  if  there  was  reason-</span><span>  able  evidence  to  show  that  he  must  bave</span><span>  known  they  were  valueless,  the  law  assumes</span><span>  inteut.  It  seems  to  us  he  was  guilty  of  a  crime,</span><span>  and  should  have  been  brought  before  his</span><span>  country.  -  If  anyone  cm  throw  light  upon</span><span>  the  subject  we  shall  esteem  it  a  favour,  for</span><span>  when  when  we  remember  in  the  case  of  a  lad</span><span>  tried  at  last  sessions  for  forgery-or  rather</span><span>  altering  an  order  for  .the  payment  of  money</span></p> <p><span>  with  inteut  tn  defraud-the  accused  tendered</span><span>  repayment  nf  the  amount  he  bad  come  by</span><span>  dishonestly,  and  was  yet  tried,  committed,</span><span>  then  pleaded  guilty  and  was  sentenced.  We</span><span>  are  at  a  loss  as  to  whether  or  not  in  theoase</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  illustrious  foreigners,  a  felony  has</span><span>  been  compounded.</span></p> <p><span>  DÜRING  tbe  debate  before  the  Royal</span><span>  Colonial  Institute  on  the  paper  read  by  Sir</span></p> <p><span>  Francis  Dillon  Bell  on  the  Indebtedness  of</span><span>  tho  Colonies,  there  appeared  on  the  part  of  a</span><span>  large  majority  of  thc  speakers  a  desire,  not  so</span><span>  much  to  arrive  at  a  fair  unbiassed  decision  on</span><span>  the  matter,  as  to  represent  the  colonies  being</span><span>  justified  in  continuing  borrowing.  The  sole</span><span>  object  of  the  speakers  seemed  to  be  to  prove</span><span>  this,  not  to  test  the  subject,  and  when  most  of</span><span>  the  speakers  aro  remembered  to  be  men  who</span><span>  are  largely  iutcrosted  in  maintaining  the  credit</span><span>  of  the  colonies,  while  others  are  immediately</span><span>  iuterested  in  the  profits  accruing  from  the  suc-</span><span>  cessful  floating  of  the  loans  at  present  under</span><span>  proposal,  it  will  be  understood  that  all  their</span><span>  glowing  panegyrics  os  to  Australia's  boundless</span><span>  wealth,  and  almost  incalculable  assets,  must  be</span><span>  taken  for  what  they  are  worth.  It  was  also</span><span>  a  noticeable  feature  of  the  debato  that  the</span><span>  only  speakers  who  questioned  thc  correctness</span><span>  of  Sir  Francis'  calculations,  were  greeted  with</span><span>  interruptions,  and  not  acoorded  a  fair  and</span><span>  impartial  hearing.  One  of,  perhaps,  tho  most</span><span>  remarkable  suggestions  fell  from  the  lips  of</span><span>  Mr.  Strangways,  who  pointed  out  that  when</span><span>  tho  colonies  had  no  debts  they  had  no  friends.</span><span>  This  wss  hinting  at  the  advisability  of  getting</span><span>  into  debt  to  gain  the  interest  and  friendship  of</span><span>  the  creditors.  If  the  dove  were  to  flutter  in</span><span>  tho  vicinity  of  an  eagle,  tho  said  eagle  would</span><span>  doubtless  take  an  interest  in  it.  If  that  is  the</span><span>  sort  of  interest  England  takos  in  tho  colonies,</span><span>  it  means  that  her  capitalists  Want  ta  strangle</span><span>  our  prosperity,  and  retard  our  progress,  by</span><span>  having  us  in  the  handy  position  of  being  able</span><span>  to  put  the  screw  on  at  any  time.  Look  at  the</span><span>  idea  from  an  individual  standpoint,  and  let</span><span>  us  suppose  that  a  progressive  young  man  in</span><span>  Queensland,  wishing  to  obtain  a  uumber  of</span><span>  friends,  got  over  bead  and  cars  ia  debt  :  would</span><span>  there  be  many  people  found  lOBt  in  admiration</span><span>  at  bis  far-seeing  and  noble  policy  Î  Yet  this</span><span>  pernicious  principle  is  actually  advocated  in</span><span>  International  policy.  Mr.  Strangways,  how-</span><span>  ever,  struck  a  very  tuneful  chord,  when  he</span><span>  said  it  was  significant  that  the  consideration</span><span>  of  tho  wealth  of  the  colonies  had  been  brought</span><span>  before  the  Institute  at  a  time  when  large  loans</span><span>  were  being  put  in  the  English  money  market.</span><span>  It  was  significant,  but  surely  the  members  of</span><span>  the  Institute  did  it  unwittingly-surely  they</span><span>  bad  no  interest  in  proclaiming  Australia's</span><span>  wealth.  We  know  this  is  an  age  of  diem</span><span>  terostcd  patriotism,  and  so  uiuBt  consider  that</span><span>  the  remarkable  coincidence  to  which  Mr.</span><span>  Strangways  drew  attention  was  quite  acci-</span></p> <p><span>  dental.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  weather  during  yesterday  was  quite  «</span><span>  change  to  what  has  boen  experienced  lately,</span><span>  the  sky  was  cloudy  and  soveral  heavy  showers</span><span>  fell.  Early  yesterday  morning,  before  day-</span><span>  light,  a  trcmcudous  shower  fell,  one  of  the</span><span>  hoaviest  that  has  been  experienced  for  some</span><span>  time  past.

After  the</span><span>  growth  bas  become  solid,  an'd  is  a  true  spavin,</span><span>  it  can  not  be  cured,  but  only  relievod.</span><span>  Spavins  are  often  very  sensitive,  and  oause</span><span>  great  pain.  They  cause  tho  horse  to  tread</span><span>  upon  thc  toe  of  thc  foot  for  relief;  this  changes</span><span>  the  growth  of  the  foot,  and  of  the  máselos  and</span><span>  tendons  of  the  leg  more  or  less.  Thu  hoof</span><span>  grows  high  at  the  heel,  and  contracts.  Now</span><span>  this  condition  of  things  can  not  be  cured  in</span><span>  the  ordinary  sense  of  the  word,  and  any  seller</span></p> <p><span>  of  a  liniment  or  other  article  who  claims  to</span><span>  enre  spavin  is  a  humbug.  Nevertheless,  the</span><span>  liniment  may  be  valuable  as  affording  relief  to</span><span>  the  horse,  either  by  benumbing  the  muselés,</span><span>  or  by  allaying  the  inflammation  or  irritability</span><span>  of  the  parts,  so  that  the  animal  may  cease  to</span><span>  go  lame  for  a  time,  if  not  permanently.</span></p> <p><span>  AN  APPEAL  TO  THE  FAIR  SEX.-It  will  be</span><span>  remembered  that  the  Marquis  of  Lorne</span><span>  recently  held  out  high  hopes  to  unattached</span><span>  young  women  who  may  be  disposed  to  emi-</span><span>  grate  to  the  Canadian  North-west.  He  said</span><span>  that  a  young  woman  would  have  twenty  offers</span><span>  in  a  week,  and  that  the  further  West  she</span><span>  went  the  more  offers  she  would  get.  A</span><span>  pamphlet  just  published,  entitled  ""  Fat  Land</span><span>  for  Lean  Tillers,""  states  that  a  good-looking</span><span>  woman  oan  choose  among  fifty  adorers,  while</span><span>  a  plain  one  can  select  from  five  ;  and  the</span><span>  writer  interprets  his  estimate  literally  by</span><span>  adding  that,  ia  his  opinion,  no  good-tempered</span><span>  woman  is  plain.  The  author  quotes  from  a</span><span>  Canadian  paper  the  following  paragraph  on  the</span><span>  subject  :-""The  cry  is:  Still  they  don't  come.</span><span>  Giris  of  Ontario,  come  West  I  come  West  !</span><span>  We  have  in  our  town  many  eligibles.

Several  hairdressers  wore  incrimin-</span><span>  ated  by  tho  revelations  of  tho  delinquent</span><span>  Lotze.

In  a  few  months  they  bred  freely,</span><span>  and  being  distributed  over  the  island,  in  the</span><span>  short  space  of  two  years  had  extirpated  the</span></p> <p><span>  rats.  The  beneficial  effect  of  their  introduc-</span><span>  tion  has  been  estimated  at  from  £100,000  to</span><span>  £150,000  a  year.

In</span><span>  the  caBc  of  theie  plants  thc  reason  is  obvious</span><span>  enough.  Not  only  do  thc  plants  need  all  the</span><span>  air  and  sunlight  they  eau  get,  but  thc  fruit</span><span>  itself  must  be  kept  off  tho  ground,  or  it  will</span><span>  decay  and  become  prey  to  vermin.  But  few</span><span>  ever  tlwught  of  providing  similar  supports  for</span><span>  sweet  potato  vines  to  climb  upon,  or  ever</span><span>  thought  that  it  would  be  any  benefit  at  all  to</span><span>  keep  thom  off  the  ground  during  thc  growing</span><span>  period.  Yet  au  accidental  discovery,  made</span><span>  thc  (lasts  ummer,  almost  convinces  us  that  it</span><span>  would  bc  much  better  to  provide  in  some</span><span>  cheap  way  a  support  to  keep  tho  potato  vines</span><span>  off  the  ground  aud  thus  havo  both  them  and</span><span>  the  earth  about  thc  roots  more  accessible  to</span><span>  light,  heat,  and  air.  AU  know  how  hard  it  is</span><span>  to  prevent  sweet  potato  vines  from  taking</span><span>  root,  especially  during  a  rainy  season.  If,</span><span>  then,  thc  vines  could  he  minie  to  climb  upon</span><span>  some  such  support  as  brush,  stuck  along  the</span><span>  ridge  from  end  to  end,  this  would  be</span><span>  prevented,  the  vines  and  the  whole  plant</span></p> <p><span>  would  set  more  air,  and  tbe  ground  could  bc</span><span>  worked  and  kept  6ne  and  mellow  a«  long  as</span><span>  tho  growing  season  last«.

Sir  Alex.</span><span>  Galt,  who  then  enjoyed  the  title  of  High</span><span>  Commissioner  for  Canada,  was  spokesman</span><span>  on  behalf  of  the  Colonies,  and  the  pith  of</span><span>  Ms  remarks  were  that  the  reception  of</span><span>  the  deputation  was  regarded  as  evincing</span><span>  an  appreciation  of  the  growing  impor-</span></p> <p><span>  tance  of  the  constitutional  colonies.</span><span>  ""  Our  respective  Governments  ""  he</span><span>  said  ""  will  be  promoted  by  a  more</span><span>  formal  recognition  '  than  has  hither-</span><span>  to  been  found  advisable  of  the  deep</span><span>  interest,  which  is  felt  by  the  colonies  in</span><span>  all  that  concerns  the  nation,  of  which</span><span>  they  regard  themselves  as  an  integral</span><span>  part.""  Lord  Derby  replied  in  courteous</span><span>  phrases,  and  while  confessing  how  im-</span><span>  possible  it  was  to  forecast  the  future,</span><span>  said  ""the  British  Government  recognised</span><span>  and  duly  valued,  the  attachment  of  their</span><span>  colonial  kinsmen  to  the  constitution</span><span>  under  which  they  lived,  to  the  mother</span><span>  country  from  which  they  have  sprung,</span><span>  and  to  the  empire  of  which,  though</span><span>  divided  by  distance,  they  continue  to</span><span>  form  an  integral  part.""  These  are  mere</span><span>  formal  phrases,  apparently,  but  they  are</span><span>  held  to  possess  a  significance  which</span></p> <p><span>  lies  below  the  surface.  It  has  been  a</span></p> <p><span>  matter  of  some  jealousy  and  ill</span><span>  feeling  that,  while  the  envoy  of</span><span>  any  petty  European  state  or  duchy</span><span>  claimed,  and  was  accorded,  certain</span><span>  honours  and  privileges  at  the  British</span><span>  Court,  the  representatives  of  colonies  as</span><span>  large  as  the  whole  of  Europe-of  people</span><span>  attached  to  Britain  by  ties,  kindred,</span></p> <p><span>  policy,  commerce,  and  aspirations,  and</span><span>  in  number  far  surpassing  the  population</span><span>  of  Continental  provinces,  were  denied</span><span>  suc'i  favours.  They  have  been  kept  in</span><span>  the  background,  and  treated  very  much</span><span>  as  commercial  officers  rather  than</span></p> <p><span>  political  representatives.  This  latest</span><span>  proceeding  on  the  part  of  the  Agents</span><span>  General  is  made  matter  for  congratula-</span><span>  tion,  because  by  it  they  are  supposed  to</span><span>  have  improved  their  political  status.</span><span>  The  Times  says:-""Since  they  have</span><span>  become  the  mouthpieces  of  their  Govern-</span><span>  ments  Tor  political  as  well  as  commercial</span><span>  purposes,  the  Agents-General  feel  that  the</span><span>  statusaf  accredited  representatives  should</span><span>  be  accorded  them.  They  are  the  only</span><span>  channel  through  which  the  Imperial</span></p> <p><span>  Government  can  obtain  authentic  know-</span><span>  ledge  of  the  aims  and  '  wishes  of  the</span><span>  colonies,  and  that  being  so  The  Times</span><span>  considers  that  every  facility  should  be</span><span>  given  them  for  discharging  their  func-</span><span>  tions.""  Other  English  journals  coincide</span><span>  in  this  opinion,  and  colonial  ones  in</span><span>  general  express  satisfaction  at  the  in-</span><span>  creased  dignity  acquired  by  our  repre-</span><span>  sentatives.  If  the  proceeding  possess</span><span>  all  the  significance  which  some  people</span><span>  desire  should  be  attached  to  it,  then  we</span><span>  must  ourselves  pay  more  attention  to  our</span><span>  Agents-General.  Their  duties  hitherto</span><span>  have,  to  a  very  large  extent,  been  of  a</span><span>  commercial  character.  Their  duties</span></p> <p><span>  have  consisted  mainly,  it  has  been</span><span>  understood,  in  purchasing  materials</span></p> <p><span>  for  carrying  on  public  works  in  the</span><span>  colonies,  and  in  promoting  and  regulating</span><span>  emigration  (rom  the  home  countries  to</span><span>  those  represented.  If,  however,  they</span><span>  are  to  possess  political  privileges  and</span><span>  I  functions  in  future,  some  effort  will</span></p> <p><span>  require  to  be  made  to  define  these.  No</span><span>  argument  is  needed  to  show  that  it  will</span><span>  not  do  to  endow  them  with  unlimited</span></p> <p><span>  political  powers.  If  they  are  left  to  do</span><span>  as  they  please,  they  may  commit  the</span><span>  colonies  to  a  course  of  action,  which  the</span><span>  bulk  of  the  electors  might  repudiate.</span><span>  An  illustration  of  the  danger  to  which  a</span><span>  colony  might  be  exposed  by  the  unwar-</span><span>  ranted  action  of  an  Agent-General  was</span><span>  furnished  by  the  conduct  of  Mr.  E.</span><span>  Jenkins,  when  appointed  representative</span><span>  of  Canada.  Being  of  advanced  Radical</span><span>  opinions,  and  of  an  assuming  disposition,</span><span>  he  almost  brought  the  home  and  colonial</span><span>  authorities  into  collision.  His  peremp-</span><span>  tory  dismissal  from  office  alone  prevented</span></p> <p><span>  much  mischief.  It  must  be  remembered</span><span>  that  the  connection  of  the  colonies  with</span><span>  the  mother  country  is  of  a  most  in-</span><span>  definite  description.  The  British  Parlia-</span><span>  ment  is  supreme  over  the  whole  British</span><span>  empire,  and  the  acts  of  our  colonial</span><span>  Parliaments  are  liable  to  be  annulled  by</span><span>  it  ;  but  the  Imperial  government  would</span><span>  scarcely  dare  to  impose  an  obnoxious</span><span>  statute  on  any  colony,  or  decline  to</span><span>  authorise  a  measure,  in  adopting  which</span><span>  our  representatives  had  the  support  of</span><span>  their  constituents.  The  Crown  is  the</span></p> <p><span>  fountain  of  justice  in  the  colonies,  and</span><span>  retains  the  power  of  declaring  peace  and</span><span>  war,  but  these  are  bonds  which  it  would</span><span>  not  be  difficult  to  sever.  In  this</span></p> <p><span>  state  of  our  relationships,  it  will  be</span><span>  apparent,  that  an  imprudent  officious</span><span>  Agent-General,  acting  in  perfect</span><span>  good  faith,  and  doing  what  he</span><span>  belived  to  be  for  the  best,  may  never-</span><span>  theless  prejudice  the  political  liberties</span><span>  ind  privileges  of  the  colonists.  We  have</span><span>  a  most  tender  and  loving  regard  for  the</span><span>  mother-country,  and  the  political  rights</span><span>  we  possess  ia  common  with  all  British</span><span>  subjects,  and  have  no  wish  these  should</span><span>  be  imperilled  by  the  conduct  of  any  indi-</span><span>  vidual.  That  will  be  best  prevented  by</span><span>  withholding  the  power  of  doing  so.  It</span><span>  must  also  occur  to  maayjol  our  readers  that</span><span>  if  Agents-General  are  to  havean  improved</span><span>  political  status  they  should  be  changeable</span><span>  like  the  administrations  they  represent.</span><span>  A  political  representative,  void  of</span><span>  political  bias  or  proclivities,  would  not</span></p> <p><span>  be  worth  much,  because  a  person  öfthat</span><span>  character  could  not  have  paid  much</span><span>  attention  to  the  affairs  of  the  colony.</span><span>  Every  man  of  intelligence  forms  his</span><span>  own  opinions,  and  seeks  to  give  effect</span><span>  to  them.  A  Radical  Agent-General,</span><span>  therefore,  without  trespassing  beyond  the</span><span>  recognised  bounds  of  his  province,</span><span>  might  nevertheless  be  a  serious  trouble</span></p> <p><span>  and  inconvenience  to  a  Conservative</span><span>  Administration.  To  make  the  head  of</span><span>  our  London  office  in  accord  with  our</span><span>  Government  it  would  be  necessary  he</span><span>  should  be  of  the  same  party.  These""</span><span>  points  are  of  so  much  general  interest</span><span>  they  are  sure  to  attract  attention  in  the</span><span>  other  colonies,  and  it  is  to  be  hoped  our</span><span>  electors  will  not  remain  indifferent  as  to</span><span>  their  settlement.</span></p> <p><span>  After  a  few  fitful  showers  on  Tuesday  and</span><span>  yesterday  a  thunder  plump  occurred  yester-</span><span>  day  afternoon,  and  the  downfall  continued</span><span>  with  little  intermission,  until  the  time  of  our</span><span>  going  to  press.  Weather  reports  show  that</span><span>  most  of  the  northern  coast  towns  have  had</span><span>  light  showers,  and  in  the  western  districts</span><span>  there  were  indications  of  rain.

Oxnam  with  a</span></p> <p><span>  party  of  gentlemen  interested  in  the  devolope</span><span>  mont  of  the  mining  resources  of  the  district</span><span>  paid  a  visit  to  the  Crooodile  goldfield  yester-</span><span>  day.  They  left  town  at  10  a.m.  and  had  fine</span><span>  weather,  ani  a  good  road  on  the  outward</span><span>  journey.  They  arrived  on  tho  field  shortly</span><span>  before  1  p.m,  and  commenced  the  work  of</span><span>  inspection.  The  first  claim  visited  was  that</span><span>  of  the  Crocodile  Creek  Alluvial  Gold  Mining</span><span>  Company  where  it  was  seen  that  Captain</span><span>  Osborne  was  making  good  progress  in  sinking,</span><span>  a  depth  of  about  eighteen  feet  having</span><span>  been  reaohed.  Until  timbering  up  is  done</span><span>  no  farther  sinking  osn  be  accomplished.</span><span>  Several  men  were  engaged  cutting  the  neces-</span><span>  sary  timber  for  that  purpose.  Pits  had  been</span><span>  dug  for  the  engine  bed,  and  the  work  per-</span><span>  formed  showed  that  Captain  Osborne  had</span><span>  began  preparations  in  a  style  euch  aa  would</span><span>  be  expected  from  an  experienced  miner.  Some</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  drift  on  top  of  the  wash  dirt  looked</span><span>  good,  but  was  uot  tried.  Altogether  there</span><span>  was  evidenoe  of  very  satisfactory  work,</span><span>  so  far,  having  been  performed.  The  machinery</span><span>  lately  arrived  from  Sydney  will  be  trans-</span><span>  mitted  to  the  field  so  soon  as  the  road  is  prao</span><span>  ticable  for  travelling  such  weighty  material.</span><span>  Messrs.  Muir  and  Company  are  working  No  1</span><span>  claim  on  the  Uurdett-Ooutts  line  of  reef,  and</span><span>  from  the  character  of  the  stone  being  raised  a</span><span>  good  crushing  is  anticipated.  In  the  Block</span><span>  and  Pillar  claim,  one  and  a  half  mile  from</span><span>  Crocodile  Creek,  the  proprietors,  Messrs.</span><span>  Hicks  Brothers,  stopped  at  the  water</span><span>  level  owing  to  an  influx  of  water.</span><span>  They  are  doing  top  work,  and  have</span><span>  a  quantity  of  splendid  Btone  at  grass.</span><span>  They  seemed  quite  satisfied  with  their</span><span>  prospects,  judgiog  from  the  quality  of  the</span><span>  stone  shown.  Some  of  the  party  did  a  little</span><span>  Alpine  climbing  on  the  hill  to  inspect  the</span><span>  ground  held  by  tho  proposed  Crocodile</span><span>  Mountain  Cold  Mining  Company.  They</span><span>  returned  fully  satisfied  as  to  thc  show</span><span>  of  tho  locality.  Probably  their  visit  will</span><span>  stimulate  them  to  urge  on  the  formation  of</span><span>  tho  Company,  aud  facilitate  the  commence-</span><span>  ment  of  operations  in  a  favourable  season.</span><span>  The  country  all  along  the  road  and  at  the</span><span>  Crocodile  is  said  to  be  looking  splendid,  thc</span><span>  gross  having  a  verdant  appearance  and  water</span><span>  being  plentiful.  Thc  return  journey  was</span><span>  effected  under  circumstances  far  from  pleasant.</span><span>  When  about  a  mile  and  a-half  from  thc  creek</span><span>  a  blinding  rain  ant  in,  and  further  on  it  was</span><span>  found  how  heavy  had  been  the  downpour.</span></p> <p><span>  Sheets  ot  water  covered  the  road  and  low</span></p> <p><span>  lying  country  in  all  diieo'.ious,  At  Meura</span></p> <p><span>  '  .  i..-  '?  ,  -</span></p> <p><span>  Platos  the  creek  «na  fuÚ»  four  feet  high.</span><span>  Fortunately  the  travellers  ïrere  eaeooncedín  a</span><span>  oovered-in  sociable,  and  ejàeped  a  drenching.

Nothing</span><span>  further  was  seen  of  him  by  white  men  until</span><span>  the  report  of  his  murder  was  brought  in  by</span><span>  three  of  the  troopers,  all  of  whom  had  been</span><span>  badly  wounded.  The  other  two  reached</span><span>  Farley  head  station,  but  were  too  badly  hurt</span><span>  to  proceed  further.  It  was  stated  that  Mr.</span><span>  Beresford  had  been  killed  by  the  blacks  while</span><span>  asleep,  and  his  body  was  found  as  the  troopers</span><span>  had  described,  rolled  up  in  blankets  and</span><span>  lightly  covered  over  with  sand.  The  skull</span><span>  and  forehead  were  smashed  in,  and</span><span>  there  was  also  a  spear  wound  in  the</span><span>  right  thigh.  All  round  where  the  body</span><span>  lay  were  tracks  of  the  blacks,  and  a  great</span><span>  quantity  of  their  implements  of  war  were</span></p> <p><span>  strewn  about,  many  of  the  latter  being  stained</span></p> <p><span>  with  blood.  All  the  witnesses  agree  in  the</span><span>  belief  that  there  is  no  reason  to  suspect  the</span><span>  troopers  of  fowl  play.  Indeed,  the  two  troopers</span><span>  who  reached  Farley  head  station  had  quite  a</span><span>  number  of  spear  points  in  them,  and  the  other</span><span>  three,  as  before  stated,  were  severely  wounded.</span><span>  A  grave  was  dug  on  the  spot,  and  on  the  order</span><span>  of  Mr.  A.  A.  Hart,  J.  P.,  the  body  was  in-</span><span>  terred.  A  rough  head  and  foot  stone  were  put</span><span>  in  the  ground  to  mark  the  place  of  his  burial,</span><span>  and  the  grave  was  paved  round  with  rough</span><span>  stones  so  as  to  keep  the  heavy  rains  from</span><span>  washing  the  earth  away.—Courier.</span></p> <p><span>  A  EOWINO  OïLKBRrrr.-Those  who  take</span><span>  an  interest  tn  aquatics  (and  we  believe  there</span><span>  are  a  good  many  in  this  town)  will  doubtless</span><span>  be  pleased  to  know  that  a  celebrated  rower</span><span>  has  arrived  in  Maryborough,  and  intends</span><span>  settling  down  in  the  neighbourhood.  We</span><span>  refer  to  Mr.  T.  G.  White,  whose  name  about</span><span>  25  years  or  40  ago  was  as  well  known  in  the</span><span>  rowing  world  as  Hanlon'*  and  Tricketts  are</span><span>  now.  Mr.  White  during  his  halcyon  days</span><span>  rowed  seventy-five  races,  of  which  fae  won</span><span>  no  less  than  sixty-seven.  Amongst  others,  he</span><span>  defeated  George  Drewitt,  J.  Finnis,  and  the</span><span>  oelebrated  Harry  Clasper.  The  mee  with  the</span><span>  latter  was  rowed  on  the  Champion  Course,</span><span>  from  Putney  to  Mortlake,  on  the  Thames,  and</span><span>  time  in  which  it  was  performed  has  never  been</span><span>  equalled.  In  Franoe,  io  the  year  '57,  at  Paris</span><span>  and  Rouen,  he  won  four  rases  in  oue  day,  being</span><span>  in  each  race  pitted  against  a  fresh  man.  For</span><span>  this  feat  he  was  decorated  by  the  late  Emperor</span><span>  Napoleon  personally,  receiving  at  his  hands  two</span><span>  splendid  gold  medals,  and  was  highly  compli-</span><span>  mented  by  his  Imperial  Majesty  on  the  prowess</span><span>  he  displayed  on  the  occasion.  He  has-also</span><span>  been  decorated  with  a  massive  gold  medal  by</span><span>  the  Sing-of  the  Belgians  for  rowing  per«</span><span>  manees  in  Belgium.  He  twice  challenged</span><span>  Harry  Kelly,  the  ex-ehampion  of  England,</span><span>  for  a  stake  of  £200,  but  Kelly  would  not  piok</span><span>  up  the  gauntlet.  He  was,  however,  after  one</span><span>  of  the  most  successful  careers  on  record,  at</span><span>  last  defeated  by  that  wonder  of  his  age.  Harry</span><span>  Chambers,  in  a  race  for  the  ohampionBbip  of</span><span>  the  United  Kingdom.  Out  of  the  numerous</span><span>  trophies  he  has  won  in  his  time,  he  bas</span><span>  brought  to  Maryborough  the  Dogett  coat  aod</span><span>  badge  (one  of  the  greatest  curiosities  probably</span><span>  ever  ecen  in  this  colony),  the  medal  presented</span><span>  to  him  by  Napoleon  III,,  some  valuable  rings,</span><span>  and  a  number  of  other  oostly  presents  received</span><span>  at  various  times  from  distinguished  parsonages,</span><span>  the  Prince  of  Wales  included.  These  were</span><span>  courteously  submitted  to  our  admiring  gaze</span><span>  yesterday  at  the  Post  Office  Hotel,  where,  for</span><span>  the  present,  Mr.  White  is  staying.-  Mary-</span><span>  borough  Chronicle.</span></p> <p><span>  A  CLEVBR  ABUEST.-On  the  night  of  2Stb</span><span>  nttimo,  Mr.  Hugh  M'Donnell,  of  Elisabeth</span><span>  street,  Melbourne,  was  robbed  of  a  valuable</span><span>  gold  watch  and  chain,  in  a  mysterious  manner</span><span>  whilst  be  waa  returning  throng!)  the  city  to</span><span>  his  home.  Being  somewhat  under  the  in-</span><span>  fluence  of  liquor  he  could  not  remember  the</span><span>  locality  in  whioh  the  robbery  was  committed.</span><span>  The  case  was  placed  in  the  bands  of  Detective</span><span>  O'Donoell,  who  for  som-)  time  had  suspected  a</span><span>  :  Chinaman,  residing  iu  Brogan's-Iane,  of  being</span></p> <p><span>  implicated  in  various  robberies,  and  he  there</span><span>  I  fore  determined  to  exercise  bia  vigilance  in</span></p> <p><span>  that  direction.

The  highest</span><span>  estate  whioh  a  subject  osn  have  in  land  ia  the</span><span>  fee  simple,  and  this  is  no  mors  than  a  qualified</span><span>  fee  ;  and  the  owner  holds  as  a  tenant  ander</span></p> <p><span>  the  Crown,  so  that  really  an  estate  in  fee  ,</span><span>  eirople  is  merely  a  tenanoy,  But  any  less</span><span>  estate  is  hampered  with  legal  restrictions,</span><span>  whioh  mom  or  less  prevent  the  lend  from</span><span>  being  used  to  the  greatest  rmhlichsnefliV  and</span><span>  the  State,  which  regulates  the  MfeBup  of:</span><span>  real  property  by  demise,  may  also)^^^^nry,  Í</span><span>  enact  laws  to  regulate  the  uses  |^ewmi  lt</span><span>  shall  be  applied,  .  ,</span></p> <p><span>  loan  see  no  good  objection  to  the  creation</span><span>  of  large  estates  or  to  the  system  of  landlord</span><span>  and  tenant  provided  the  landlords  be  not</span><span>  absentees  and  provided  the  landlords  be  other  !</span><span>  than  the  State.  ?  On  the  contrary  I  think  this</span><span>  is  the  best  means  of  giving  the  direct  manage-</span><span>  ment  of  the  land  to  practical  men.  A  tenant</span><span>  from  year  to  year,  or  for  a  term  of  years,  gets</span><span>  in  fact  the  ase  of  capital  (equal  in  amount  to</span><span>  the  value'of  the  fee  simple)  at  the  lowest</span><span>  current  rate  of  interest,  for  interest  upon</span><span>  mortgage  is  nearly  always  greater  than  a  fajr</span><span>  rent  obarge,-«nd  frequently  men  who  are</span><span>  rich  enough  to  own  a  farm,  and  have'snfflcient</span><span>  capital  to  stock  it.  are  too  fond  of  their  own</span><span>  estate  to  ase  the  land  to  the  greatest  public</span></p> <p><span>  benefit.</span></p> <p><span>  .

"<p><span>  KOCIUIAMTTON.</span></p> <p><span>  THUnSDAY,  MAY  3,  1683.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  period  at  which  Parliament  will</span><span>  meet  is  a  fair  subject  for  public  dis-</span><span>  cussion.  Among  the  constitutional</span><span>  duties  of  an  intelligent  body  of  electors,</span><span>  and  of  the  press  as  thc  exponent  of  their</span><span>  feelings  and  opinions,  is  to  watch  how</span><span>  the  business  of  the  country  is  being  con-</span><span>  ducted,  and  bring  such  influence  as  they</span><span>  may  possess  to  bear  on  the  Ministry,  in</span><span>  the  event  of  errors  being  made,  or  want</span><span>  of  activity  displayed.  That  there  should</span><span>  be  no  unnecessary  delay  in  the  manage-</span><span>  ment  of  colonial  affairs  will  be  admitted,</span><span>  and,  in  criticising  thc  date  of  the</span><span>  meeting  of  Parliament,  the  press  is  per-</span><span>  forming  an  important  function.  It  is  a</span><span>  pity,  however,  such  intelligent  journals</span><span>  as  the  lirisbone  Telegraph  and  Too-</span><span>  woomba  Chronicle  cannot  discharge  it</span><span>  without  indulging  in  offensive,  vilipen</span><span>  I  dil  g.  and  abuse  of  the  Premier/  and</span></p> <p><span>  attributing  to  him  interested  motives</span><span>  in  delaying  thc  assembling  of</span><span>  our  legislators.  In  a  Government</span><span>  Gazette  Extraordinary  Parliament  has</span><span>  been  prorogued  till  the  5th  June,</span><span>  and  it  is  assumed  that,  between  that</span><span>  date  and  the  151I1  November,  when  the</span><span>  present  Parliament  will  cease  to  exist  by</span><span>  effluxion  of  time,  the  period  is  too  short</span><span>  lo  permit  ol  useful  legislation  being</span><span>  accomplished.  The  Premier  is  twitted</span><span>  by  the  journals  we  have  named,  with  not</span><span>  having  redeemed  a  promise  made  to</span><span>  Mr.  Griffith  last  Session,  that  Parliament</span><span>  would  be  called  together  sooner  this</span><span>  year.  But  no  definite  promise  was</span><span>  made.  When  interrogated  upon  the</span><span>  subject  by  the  leader  of  the  Opposition,</span><span>  ?lbe  Premier  said.  ""  hejhpu¿iLJiiiuself_¡t</span><span>  woiíidue  a~imicTrbëller  arrangement  to</span><span>  bring  Parliament  together  earlier  next</span><span>  year  than  was  thc  case  either  in  the</span><span>  present  or  last  year.""  From  the  state</span><span>  of  the  public  business  thc  Premier  does</span><span>  not  now  seem  to  be  of  opinion  that</span><span>  there  is  any  necessity  for  the  session</span><span>  opening  earlier  much  than  in  the  last</span><span>  two  years.  The  Opposition  journals</span><span>  have  attempted  to  show  cause  why</span><span>  Parliament  should  meet  sooner,  but  in</span><span>  this  matter  they  have  not  made  out  a  good</span><span>  case.  Tile  C/imu'ck,  after  devoting  a</span><span>  column  and  three  quarters  to  prove  that</span><span>  Parliament  should  have  been  called</span><span>  together  earlier  this  year,  completely  dis-</span><span>  integrates  its  own  arguments  by  re-</span><span>  marking-""  The  Parliament  is  now  in</span><span>  the  last  stages  of  its  existence.  It  may</span><span>  certainly  be  called  a  moribund  Parlia-</span><span>  ment,  and  to  allow  such  a  Parliament  lo</span><span>  initiate  any  measures  of  Government</span><span>  legislation,  will  be  entirely  opposed  to  all</span><span>  constitutional  practice.""  It  seems  a  fair</span><span>  deduction,  from  Ibis  state  or  matters,</span><span>  that  there  is  no  necessity  for  Parliament</span><span>  meeting  early.  It  is  not  in  a  condition</span><span>  to  produce  useful  measures,  and,  there-</span><span>  fore,  it  is  most  desirable,  it  should</span><span>  not  spend  time  in  making  the  attempt  :</span><span>  as  our  contemporary  remarks  that  would</span><span>  be  opposed  to  all  constitutional  practice.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Telegraph  says  ""  the  delay  in</span><span>  putting  into  practice  the  personal  views</span><span>  of  the  Premier,  as  to  the  time  of  meet-</span><span>  ing,  may  be  due  to  the  incompleteness</span><span>  of  the  negotiations  on  the  land-grant</span><span>  railway  schemes,  and  coloured  labour</span><span>  for  sugar  plantations.""  Upon  pondering</span><span>  over  these  matters,  our  readers  may  find</span><span>  some  difficulty  in  discovering  where  the</span><span>  incompleteness  exists.  Practically,  thc</span></p> <p><span>  present  Parliament  has  shown  its  dis-  '</span><span>  approbation  of  the  Warrego  Railway</span><span>  scheme.  It  will  not  likely  be  brought</span><span>  forward  again  for  consideration  before</span><span>  the  Dissolution.  The  Transcontinental</span><span>  Railway  scheme  is  the  question  of  the</span><span>  day  ;  and  with  regard  to  it,  the  Premier's</span></p> <p><span>  views  have  been  matured.  To  some</span><span>  extent  -  in  fact,  as  far  as  he  could</span><span>  manage  it,  we  may  suppose-they  have</span><span>  been  embodied  in  thc  Agreement,  entered</span><span>  into  by  thc  Ministry,  with  the  Australian</span><span>  Transcontinental  Railway  Syndicate.</span><span>  We  cannot  see  why  there  should  be</span><span>  delay  because  of  any  incompleteness</span><span>  of  negotiations  on  these  mailers.  In</span><span>  connection  with  thc  coloured  labour</span><span>  question,  our  contemporary  suggests</span><span>  that  lbe  delay  may  be  due  lo  time  being</span><span>  required  to  developc  a  scheme  for</span><span>  obtaining  natives  from  New  Guinea.</span><span>  That  is,  in  the  highest  degree,  im-</span><span>  probable.  All  accounts  £0  to  sliow  that</span><span>  thc  natives  of  Papua  would  not  be</span><span>  suitable  for  plantation  labourers.  Pie</span><span>  sides,  should  any  attempt  bc  made  lo  im-</span><span>  port  them,  thc  utilitarian,  selfish  character,</span><span>  thus  impaited  to  thc  annexation  scheme,</span><span>  would  certainly  detract  from  thc  honour</span><span>  and  wisdom  of  thc  proceeding.  Far</span><span>  other  and  more  creditable  motives,  we</span><span>  have  no  hesitation  in  saying,  inspired</span><span>  llie  Miniilry  in  their  endeavour  to  attach</span><span>  New  Guinea  to  the  Jirkish  Empire,  lt</span><span>  shows  a  remarkable  want  of  imagination,</span><span>  or  political  perspection  on  the  part  of</span><span>  the  Queen-street  philosophers,  when</span></p> <p><span>  they  cannot  propagate  more  reasonable</span><span>  and  realistic  grounds  for  thc  postpone-</span><span>  ment  of  ihe  meeting  of  Parliament.</span></p> <p><span>  Among  the  journals  which  have  con-</span><span>  demned  the  policy  of  the  Government,</span><span>  in  delaying  the  convening  of  Parliament,</span><span>  is  the  Brisbane  Courier  ;  and  its  utter-</span><span>  ances,  though  in  general  scorned  by  the</span><span>  Opposition  press  as  unworthy  of  con-</span><span>  sideration,  have  been  paraded  in  the</span><span>  columns  of  the  latter,  and  commented</span><span>  on  as  an  embodiment  of  wisdom  on  this</span><span>  matter.  The  Courier  proceeds  on  the</span><span>  assumption  that  as  Parliament  has  been</span><span>  prorogued  till  June  it  will  not  meet  till</span><span>  July  ;  and  considers  that  in  such  an</span><span>  event  there  will  not  be.time  for  such</span><span>  legislation  as  it  deems  probable.  Now,</span><span>  we  have  good  reason  to  believe  that  our</span><span>  contemporary  is  wrong  in  his  supposi-</span><span>  tion  ;  that  Parliament  will  meet  in  June;</span><span>  and  that  the  real  business  of  the  session</span><span>  wilt  be  proceeded  with  in  July  and</span><span>  August-as  the  Courier  argued  it</span><span>  should.  It  is  our  contemporary,  there-</span><span>  fore,  and  not  Sir  Thomas  M'llwraith,</span><span>  who  has  made  a  mistake.  But  even</span><span>  in  the  event  of  Parliament  not  meeting</span><span>  till  July,  there  will  be  ample  time  after</span><span>  that  for  the  despatch  of  all  the  business</span><span>  that  is  likely  to  come  before  it.  As  our</span><span>  Toowoomba  contemporary  remarks,  il</span><span>  would  not  be  altogether  constitutional</span><span>  for  a  moribund  Parliament  to  attempt</span><span>  serious  legislation.  The  Treasurer  will</span><span>  probably  be  prepared  to  make  his  Annual</span><span>  Statement  early  in  July,  and  the  discus-</span></p> <p><span>  sion  of  the  Estimates  will  be  the  most</span></p> <p><span>  important  business  of  the  Assembly.</span><span>  Of  course,  the  Transcontinental  Rail-</span></p> <p><span>  way  Agreement  will  come  up  for  discus-</span><span>  sion,  but  wc  do  not  anticipate  it  will</span><span>  occupy  much  of  the  time  of  the  House.</span><span>  It  seems  probable  the  Ministry  will  dis-</span><span>  cover,  «vhen  Parliament  meets,  they  will</span><span>  not  be  able  to  pass  it  ;  and  they  will  not</span><span>  prolong  contention  unnecessarily.  We</span><span>  think  it  improbable  they  will  take  any</span><span>  steps  in  regard  to  the  introduction</span><span>  of  coloured  labour.  AH  they  could</span><span>  do  would  be  to  submit  regu-</span><span>  lations  for  the  introduction  of</span><span>  Indian  Coolies,  provided  they  have</span></p> <p><span>  come  to  terms  with  the  Government  of</span></p> <p><span>  India  regarding  them.  The  only  measure</span><span>  that  may  require  a  fair  amount  of  con-</span><span>  sideration  is  a  Redistribution  of  Seats</span></p> <p><span>  Bill.  It  may  well  be  discussed  in  July,</span><span>  and  disposed  of  carly  in  August.  By</span><span>  the  end  ol  that  month  the  business  of</span><span>  the  Session  should  be  over,  and  members</span><span>  then  be  free  to  court  the  constituences.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  more  than  probable,  indeed,  they</span><span>  will  begin  to  do  so  before  the  Dissolu-</span><span>  tion  ;  and  we  cannot  help  thinking</span><span>  that  one  reason  why  the  assembling  of</span><span>  Parliament  is  delayed  is  because</span><span>  Ministers  mean  to  keep  members  at  their</span><span>  legitimate  work,  and  not  talking  through</span><span>  the  columns  of  Hansard  to  their  con-</span><span>  stituents.  With  a  general  election  only</span><span>  a  few  months  off  lhere  will  be  a  great</span><span>  temptation  to  indulge  in  speech-making,</span><span>  and  the  Government  have  done  well  in</span><span>  denying  hon.  members  the  opportunity</span><span>  of  wasting  the  time  of  their  colleagues,</span><span>  and  taking  up  the  attention  of  Parlia-</span><span>  ment,  by  engaging  in  electioneering</span><span>  haiaseuss,...  The  Government  having</span><span>  allowed  them  ho  time  to  talk  théyTflüst</span><span>  reserve  their  orations  till  they  meet  the</span></p> <p><span>  electors.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  pcoplo  of  Rockhampton  aro  a  long</span><span>  suffering  people,  They  have,  indeed,  the</span><span>  credit,  with  the  inhabitants  of  some  other</span><span>  towns  in  tbc  colony,  of  looking  well  and</span><span>  sharply  after  their  own  interests.  This  is  a</span><span>  popular  delusion.  They  are  content  to  endure</span><span>  inconvenience,  and  even  hardship  and  danger</span><span>  of  the  most  unreasonable  kind,  just  because  it</span><span>  pleases  some  people  to  inflict  them.  The</span><span>  habit  of  Bilent,  unmurmuring  submission,</span><span>  which  waB  learned  in  the  days  whon  the  trade</span><span>  of  thc  port  was  a  monopoly,  has  become  a</span><span>  second  nature;  and  things  that  vere,  and  are,</span><span>  are  accepted  aa  the  things  that  shall  he  for</span><span>  ever  more.  If  anyone  doubts  this,  lot  him  go</span><span>  down  to  tho  wharves  when  tho  steam  tender,</span><span>  which  conveys  passengers  to  tho  direct  coast</span><span>  mail  Btcamcrs  of  the  A  S.N.

The  un-</span><span>  rivalled  accommodation  furnished  on  board</span><span>  of  the  s.s.  Bunyip  is  well  known-by  sad  ex-</span><span>  perience-to  all  that  ""  co  down  to  thc  sea  in</span><span>  ships,  aud  do  business  in  the  mighty  waters.""</span><span>  The  witty  Frenchman  who  said  that  Admiral</span><span>  Byng  was  shot  ""-pour  encourager  hs  autres.1'</span><span>  anticipated  the  principle  on  which  tho  A.¡S.N.</span><span>  Company  treats  tbe  travelling  public  that  go</span><span>  to  and  fro  on  thc  Fitzroy.  The  object  of  tho</span><span>  company  is  evidently  to  encourago  travelling</span><span>  in  general,  and  travelling  by  their  own  steamers</span><span>  in  particular.  The  spacious  promenade  pre-</span><span>  sented  on  thc  deck  of  thc  Bunyip,  which  may</span><span>  he  said  to  be  all  poop,  main-deck,  and  fore-</span><span>  castle  rolled  into  one,  especially  when  tho</span><span>  passengers  havA  to  share  it  with  scores  of</span><span>  boxes,  and  hundreds  of  bags  of  sugar,  or  rico,</span><span>  or  other  merchandise,  is  associated,  in  tbe</span><span>  memory  of  thousands  of  travellers,  with  the</span><span>  liveliest  recollections  of  thc  room  which  it</span><span>  afforded  for  oxcrcisc,  on  cold  and  long  winter</span><span>  nights.

The  salutory  cITect</span><span>  of  this  kind  of  experience  on  passenger*,  and</span><span>  on  thu  reputation  and  profits  of  the  cwnpany,</span><span>  have  evidently  leen  appreciated  by  the</span><span>  latter  ;  fnr  instead  of  providing  a  large</span><span>  and  more  comfortable  steamer  to  replaco</span><span>  thc  Bunyip  when  disabled,  they  have  been</span><span>  content  to  hire  from  a  local  firm  a  steamer</span><span>  whose  dimensions  ahnest  lit  ber  for  being  the</span><span>  l'.nnyip'a  tender.

Sup-</span><span>  pose  that  to  these  were  added  the</span><span>  cold  of  a  winter  night,  and  perhaps</span><span>  ten  or  twelvo  hours'  detention  in  the  Bay  ;</span><span>  and  the  effects  on  the  health  of  weakly  men</span><span>  and  delicate  women  and  children  would,  in</span><span>  many  cases,  be  fatal.  It  is  a  disgrace  to  the</span><span>  A.S.N.  Company  that  so  miserable  provision</span><span>  has  been  made  by  them  for  passengers  by</span><span>  their  coast  steamers  to  and  from  Rock-</span><span>  hampton,  and  it  is  no  credit  to  our  Chamber</span><span>  of  Commerce  that  this  abuse  has  been  allowed</span><span>  to  exist  so  long.  The  intimation  just  made</span><span>  by  the  agent  of  the  A.S.N.

The</span><span>  magnitude  of  thc  Rockhampton  trade,  and  its</span><span>  rapid  growth,  ought  long  ago  to  have</span><span>  secured  for  the  port  a  steam  tender,  in</span><span>  which  passengers  might  enjoy  a  little  of</span><span>  the  comforts  and  decencies  of  civilised  life.</span><span>  Companies,  we  are  aware,  have  no  conscience,</span><span>  butin  their  dividends,  and  it  is  simple  folly  to</span><span>  suppose  that  they  will  pay  any  attention  to</span><span>  any  interest  but  their  own.  Wo  imagine</span><span>  however  that  in  this  matter  the  A.S.N.  Com-</span><span>  pany  has  been  somewhat  short-sighted,  The</span><span>  field  would  not  have  been  so  open  for</span><span>  others  to  ""cut  in,""  and  reap  thc  golden</span><span>  harvest,  which  this  Company^  once  had  all  to</span><span>  itself,  and  which  it  might  have  kept  to  itself</span><span>  perhaps  to  this  day,  had  it  looked  less  to  im-</span><span>  mediate  gainp,  and  more  to  tho  conciliation  of</span><span>  the  goodwill  and  support  of  tho  publie.

The  Chairman  reported  that  the</span><span>  survey  of  the  sito  for  the  erection  of  a  new</span></p> <p><span>  engine-house  in  Bolsover-strcet  bad  been  made  J</span><span>  by  Mr.  Bichardson,  the  District  Surveyor,</span></p> <p><span>  and  it  would  be  forwarded  to  tho  Government</span><span>  for  their  approval.  Tho  balance-sheet  and</span><span>  roll-call  of  members  were  laid  on  thc  table,</span><span>  and  approved  of.  Mr.  Wilson,  architect,  was</span><span>  in  attendance,  and  handed  in  plans  and  esti-</span><span>  mates  for  the  erection  of  a  new  engine-house,</span><span>  with  a  tower  alongside,  which  was  estimated</span><span>  to  cost  £500.  It  was  decided  to  carry  out  the</span><span>  building  in  full  accordance  with  thc  plans</span><span>  submitted,  and  a  eub-committoc,  consisting  of</span><span>  Messrs.

He  was  informed  by</span><span>  thc  wardsman  that  if  the  child  was  well</span></p> <p><span>  enough  in  the  opiuion  of  the  medical  officer</span><span>  to  bo  removed,  be  could  do  so,  but  not  unless</span><span>  this  was  so.  Hero  was  a  hard  case-thc  man,</span><span>  perhaps  without  a  penny,  and  unable  to  take</span><span>  work  in  consequence  ofhisnot  being  able  to  take</span><span>  his  child  away  on  account  of  its  illness.  It  is</span><span>  not  likely  he  would  leave  it  in  suck  a  place  as</span><span>  the  Dépôt,  with  no  ono  to  tako  care  of  it.</span><span>  What,  then,  had  he  to  do  but  to  wait  till  the</span><span>  child  was  lit  to  bo  rcmovod,  and  then  he</span><span>  might  not  bc  able  to  procure  work.  Had</span></p> <p><span>  there  been  a  Children's  Hospital  he  could  ;</span></p> <p><span>  have  sent  tho  little  one  there,  and  left  it  there</span><span>  without  any  uneasiness  until  it  was  all  right</span><span>  again.  We  have  beard  nothing  with  regard</span><span>  to  the  establishment  of  a  Children's  Hospital</span><span>  lately,  but  we  mention  these  facts  to  show</span><span>  that  the  necessity  for  it  continues  to  increase.</span></p> <p><span>  IT  docs  not  say  much  for  tho  honesty  and</span><span>  gratitude  of  thc  new  chums  in  tho  Depot  that</span><span>  they  should  have  commenced  to  try  tricks  on</span><span>  tbe  wardsman.  Ho  generally  givcB  out  free</span><span>  passes  every  evening  to  those  who  Wi6h  to  go</span><span>  up  thc  lino  the  next  morning  in  search  of</span><span>  !  work.  Those  who  have  been  in  tho  Dépôt  a</span><span>  I  certain  length  of  lime  cannot  obtain  thc</span></p> <p><span>  passes,  and  they  get  those  who  can  to  procuro</span><span>  them  as  if  they  wished  to  go  up  tho  line.  Tho</span><span>  next  morning  tho  man  who  bas  no  right  to  the</span><span>  pass  makes  uso  of  it,  and  the  ono  whose  name</span><span>  lt  was  out  in  is  left  behind.  If  tho  pass  is  not</span><span>  used  on  the  day  on  which  it  is  issued  it  is  no</span><span>  use,  and  tho  immigrant  knowing  this  comes  to</span><span>  Mr.  Beasley  the  evening  that  he  should  have</span><span>  gone  in  the  morning,  says  he  was  unable  to  go,</span></p> <p><span>  and  asks  for  another  pass  to  go  the  next  morn-  i</span><span>  ing.  It  is  probable  this  sort  of  thine  bas  been</span><span>  going  on  for  some  time,  but  tho  wardsman  has</span><span>  at  length  become  quito  as  cute  as  thc  ""  new</span><span>  chum,""  and  bc  will  not  give  a  second  pass  to</span></p> <p><span>  any  one  of  them  ou  any  pretence  whatever,  j</span><span>  In  order  that  those  who  are  innocent  may  not  '</span><span>  suffer  by  this  strict  action,  wc  advise  them  to</span><span>  inform  Mr.  Beasley  as  early  as  possible  when</span><span>  they  know  they  will  be  unable  to  proceed  np</span><span>  tho  linc  on  the  morning  they  intended,  and  for</span><span>  which  their  pass  was  drswu  out.  m</span></p> <p><span>  WE  understand  tho  Government  has  given</span><span>  instructions  for  the  survey  of  a  township  on</span><span>  thc  reserve  between  the  Six  and  Sight  Mile</span><span>  creeks,  on  tho  Kockhampton-Gladstono  Hoad.</span><span>  For  some  time  past  application  was  made  both</span><span>  to  the  Gogango  Divisional  Board  and  the</span><span>  Minister  for  Lands  for  permission  to  erect</span><span>  stores  and  public-bouses  on  the  Reserve,  and</span><span>  although  no  opposition  was  offered  to  the</span><span>  erection  of  buildings,  no  permission  could  bo</span><span>  officially  granted.

It  was</span><span>  generally  thought  thc  creek  was  a  tributary  of</span><span>  tho  Fitzroy  River,  but  persons  who  have  been</span><span>  exploring  it  lately  conclude  thc  creek  as  well</span><span>  as  Mistake  Creek,  which  enters  Raglan  Creek</span><span>  about  four  miles  above  Port  Alma,  is  all  ono.</span><span>  Our  informant  states  thc  want  of  horse</span><span>  accommodation  is  severely  felt  by  travellers,</span><span>  as  for  a  distance  of  eighty  miles  an  tho  road</span><span>  there  is  no  calling  place.</span></p> <p><span>  TIIK  criminal  sittings  of  the  Maryborough</span><span>  Circuit  Court  were  opoucd  last  Thursday</span><span>  before  his  Houor  the  Acting  Chief  Justice,</span><span>  and  concluded  ou  Friday.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  WEDNESDAY,  JUNE  27.  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  WITH  more  than  ordinary  interest  our</span><span>  readers  will  peruse  the  Governor's  Speech,</span><span>  delivered  at  the  opening  of  Parliament</span><span>  on  Tuesday  last.  Had  it  been  a  bona</span><span>  fide  production  of  the  putative  author,</span><span>  we  might  have  had  a  more  concise  and</span><span>  forcible  document  ;  but  as  the  expres-</span><span>  sion  of  the  policy  and  contemplated</span><span>  administrative  acts  of  the  Ministry,  lo  be</span><span>  keenly  criticised  by  the  community,  it</span></p> <p><span>  will  bear  full  examination.  On  the  two</span></p> <p><span>  great  questions  of  colonial  politics  it  utters</span><span>  no  uncertain  sound.  Alter  a  few  compli-</span><span>  mentary  phrases  about  the  late  Governor,</span><span>  and  the  appointment  of  the  coming  one,</span><span>  and  a  little  pardonable  self-gratulation</span><span>  about  the  prosperity  of  the  colony,  the</span><span>  Speech  adverts  to  the  land  grant  railway</span><span>  questions.  The  agreement,  which  has</span><span>  been  entered  into,  between  the  Governor</span><span>  and  the  Australian  Transcontinental</span></p> <p><span>  Railway  Syndicate,  for  the  construction</span><span>  of  a  railway,  in  terms  of  the  Railway</span><span>  Companies'  Preliminary  Act,  from</span><span>  Charleville  to  Point  Parker,  will  be  sub-</span><span>  mitted  for  the  approval  and  ratification</span><span>  of  Parliament.  So  also  will  the  Warrego</span><span>  Railway  Bill.  That  these  measures  «viii</span></p> <p><span>  receive  what  the  Governor  solicits</span></p> <p><span>  ""calm  and  dispassionate  judgment""-is</span><span>  extremely  improbable.  The  pub'lic  mind</span><span>  has  become  unsettled  in  regard</span><span>  to  '  them,  and  political  feeling  runs  too</span><span>  high  to  permit  of  either  being  deliberately</span><span>  and  dispassionately  discussed.  The</span><span>  fact  that  they  are  referred  to  in  the</span><span>  opening  paragraph  of  the.Speech  favours</span><span>  the  expectation  that  they  will  be  sub-</span><span>  mitted  to  Parliament  at  an  early  date,</span><span>  and  encourages  the  belief  that  Minis-</span><span>  ters  attach  the  greatest  importance  to</span><span>  both  measures.  .'  From  the  manner  in</span><span>  which  these  railway  schemes  are  referred</span><span>  bj)  the  inference  is  plain  that  their  rejec-</span><span>  tion  or  acceptance  will  decided  the  fate</span><span>  qf  the  party  now  in  power..</span></p> <p><span>  ;  The  allusions  to  the  annexation  of</span><span>  New  Guinea  are  not  grandiose  or  ex-</span><span>  travagant,  as  they  might  have  been  in</span><span>  the  circumstances.  Charged  with  the</span><span>  responsible  duty  of  not  only  main-</span><span>  taining  the  liberties  and  safety  of</span><span>  the  people  of  this  colony,  but</span><span>  of  guarding  the  land  of  their</span><span>  adoption-an  outlying  portion  of  the</span><span>  British  Empire-from  the  domination  or</span><span>  danger  of  sudden  invasion  by  a  foreign</span><span>  foe,  Ministers  felt  that  they  must  keep  a</span><span>  watchful  eye  on  conterminous  territory.</span><span>  New  Guinea,  it  was  apparent,  might  at</span><span>  any  time  become  a  source  of  annoyance</span><span>  and  probable  conflict  ;  and  when</span><span>  rumours  began  to  prevail,  that  it  was</span><span>  coveted  by  France  as  a  penal  settlement,</span><span>  and  by  Germany  as  an  eastern  naval</span><span>  station,  our  rulers  calmed  their  fears  and</span><span>  anxieties  by  taking  possession  in  the</span><span>  .  Queen's  name  of  the  nearest  land  on</span></p> <p><span>  the  island.  Their  conduct  has</span></p> <p><span>  been  variously  regarded,  but  it</span><span>  ?has  not  been  repudiated  by  the</span><span>  British  Government,  and  in  all</span><span>  probability  will  be  confirmed.  Their</span><span>  proceedings  in  this  matter  has  caused</span><span>  Victoria  to  regard  with  similar  appre-</span><span>  hensions  the  New  Hebrides,  and  an</span><span>  united  appeal  has  been  made  hy  thc</span><span>  Colonial  to  the  Imperial  authorities  to</span><span>  annex  the  Pacific  Islands,  which  seem</span><span>  naturally  to  belong  to  Australia.  Such</span><span>  acts  display  farseeing  wisdom  and</span><span>  prudence,  which  are  worthy  of  the</span><span>  highest  commendation  in  our  statcmen.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  Coloured  Labour  Question</span><span>  the  Speech  is  pointed  and  clear  in  its</span><span>  remarks.  The  regulations,  necessary</span><span>  under  the  old  Act  of  1SÓ2,  and  which</span><span>  must  be  concurred  in  by  the  Indian</span><span>  Government,  and  the  Colonial  Parlia-</span><span>  ment,  before  they  can  he  acted  upon,</span><span>  have  now  been  agreed  to.  They  also</span><span>  will  bc  submitted  for  consideration  and</span><span>  approval.  The  policy  of  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  on  this  question  is  simple  and</span><span>  plain.  They  favour  the  introduction  of</span><span>  Coolies,  because  by  this  means  they  will</span><span>  provide  a  safeguard  against  the  injurious</span><span>  competition  with  white  labour  of  the</span><span>  Chinese  and  Kanakas,  besides  removing</span><span>  the  stigma  which  attaches  to  Queensland</span><span>  for  cultivating  the  labour  trade  and</span><span>  perpetuating  a  species  of  slavery.  Thc</span><span>  paragraph  on  this  subject  is  most</span><span>  suggestive,  and  deserves  the  careful  con-</span><span>  sideration  of  the  wage-earning  classes  of</span><span>  the  community.  It  indicates  a  decided</span><span>  policy,  in  striking  contract  with  the</span><span>  nihilism  of  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition</span><span>  OD  this  subject,</span></p> <p><span>  '*'N^drnra|dîate  action  is  to  be  taken  on</span></p> <p><span>  the  land  question,  but  the  Government</span></p> <p><span>  èçM  t?  §M%?t  no  ordinary  significance</span><span>  tèvealeaTry  the  report  of  the  Under-</span><span>  secretary  for  Lands.  Selection  is  going  on</span><span>  rapidly  in  this  colony,  but  agriculture  is</span><span>  making  slow  progress.  The  inference  is</span><span>  plain  that  dummying  and  jobbing  by</span><span>  selection  is  attaining  noticeable  magni-</span><span>  tude,  which  will  presently  call  for  a</span><span>  remedy.</span></p> <p><span>  Promises  are  made  that  public  works,</span><span>  giving  employment  to  the  labouring</span><span>  classes,  will  be  pushed  forward,  and  our</span><span>  mail  and  emigration  services  via  Torres</span><span>  Straits  improved  to  meet  the  demands</span><span>  upon  them.  It  is  pointed  out  that</span><span>  though  the  finances  of  the  colony  are</span><span>  in  a  prosperous  condition,  and  there  will</span><span>  probably  be  a  handsome  surplus  at  the</span><span>  close  of  the  year,  more  money  must  be</span><span>  borrowed  to  carry  on  public  works  and</span><span>  immigration,  and  make  provision  for  the</span><span>  redemption  of  a  million  pounds  sterling</span><span>  of  debentures  presently  falling  due.</span></p> <p><span>  A  Re-distribution  of  Seats  Bill  is</span><span>  promised,  but  only  if  other  business</span><span>  shall  permit  of  its  being  thoroughly  con-</span><span>  sidered,  and  its  details  arranged.  Some</span><span>  time  ago  we  pointed  out  that  such  a</span><span>  measure  was  now  due,  and  that  it</span><span>  was  the  privilege  of  the  Conservative</span><span>  party,  acting  on  former  precendents,</span><span>  to  pass  it.  The  census  returns  and</span><span>  statistics  of  immigration  have  no  doubt</span><span>  put  the  Government  in  possession  of</span><span>  facts,  which  should  have  enabled  them</span><span>  to  prepare  a  fair  and  comprehensive</span><span>  measure.  It  is  greatly  to  be  desired</span><span>  they  should  launch  it,  and  guide  it</span><span>  through  the  stormy  sei  of  debate,  rather</span><span>  than  lamper  with  the  subject  in  an</span><span>  Additional  Members  Bill,  which,  how</span><span>  ever  necessary  and  fair,  will  be  open  to</span><span>  misconstruction  and  opposition.</span></p> <p><span>  Many  of  the  measures  prenvsed  in</span><span>  the  concluding  paragraph  have  already</span><span>  been  approved  by  the  Council  or  the</span><span>  Assembly,  in  and  consequence  they</span><span>  should  not  occupy  much  of  the  time  or</span></p> <p><span>  attention  of  Parliament.  None  of  them</span></p> <p><span>  is  of  such  an  impirtant  character  that</span><span>  its  postponement  till  another  session  will</span><span>  seriously  interfere  with  the  interests  of</span><span>  any  large  class  of  the  community.</span></p> <p><span>  Comprehensive,  sufficiently  decided  to</span><span>  indicate  the  policy  of  Ministers,  the</span><span>  Governor's  Speech  will  at  once  satisfy</span><span>  and  stimulate  expectation.</span></p> <p><span>  AMONG  the  important  public  papers</span><span>  issued  in  anticipation  of  the  meeting  of</span><span>  Parliament,  is  the  Annual  Report  of</span><span>  the  Commissioners  for  Railways  for</span><span>  1882..  It  is  not  a  concise  condensed</span><span>  record,  but  consists  of  a  series  of  re-</span><span>  ports  on  the  different  railways  in  the</span><span>  colony.  The  general  statements  are</span><span>  grouped  in  a  conluding  paragraph.  The</span><span>  Report  will  not  fail  to  attract  unusual</span><span>  attention  at  present,  as  capitalists,  who</span><span>  may  have  been  considering  the  propriety</span><span>  of  investing  in  Transcontinental  Railway</span><span>  stock,  will  be  anxious  to  learn  how  the</span><span>  present  railways  are  paying.  The  year</span><span>  to  which  the  Report  refers  was  a</span><span>  prosperous  one,  and  from  the  increase  in</span><span>  business  and  traffic  connected  therewith</span></p> <p><span>  the  railways  should  be  paying  well.  On</span><span>  turning  to  the  terminal  paragraph  of  the</span><span>  report  we  find  that  with  the  exception  of</span><span>  the  Bundaberg  Railway  all  our  lines</span><span>  have  been  yielding  interest  on  the  money</span><span>  expended  on  them.  The  amount  of</span><span>  capital  expended  on  open  lines  is</span><span>  .£6,244,682,  and  the  net  earnings  yielded</span><span>  last  year  interest  at  the  rate  of  ,£3</span></p> <p><span>  ns.  id.  per  cent,  or  18s.  i^d.  more,</span><span>  than  in  1881.  The  most  remunerative  ¡</span><span>  railway  is  the  Northern,  which  last  year</span><span>  paid  £4  14s.  6d.  per  cent  interest,  or</span><span>  13s.  less  than  in  1881.  Next  comes  the</span><span>  Central  Railway,  which  earned  £4</span><span>  Ss.  sd.  per  cent,  being  an  increase  of</span><span>  ios.  4yíd.  On  the  Southern  and  Wes-</span><span>  tern  Railway  the  profits  gave  £3  6s.  8d.</span><span>  per  cent,  or  an  increase  of  £1  is.  8d.</span><span>  On  the  Maryborough  Railway  there  was</span><span>  a  falling  off  during  the  year  from  £5</span><span>  i2s.  o^d.  to  .£3  9s.  6d.  The  increase</span></p> <p><span>  is  gratifying,  but  when  we  look  at  the</span><span>  amount  of  money  expended,  the  rate  at</span><span>  which  the  resources  of  the  colony  are</span><span>  being  developed,  it  is  not  greater  than</span><span>  might  be  expected.  There  is  reason</span><span>  for  solid  satisfaction  in  the  fact  that</span></p> <p><span>  the  earnings  on  our  railways  compare</span><span>  favourably  with  those  made  by  lines  in</span><span>  the  other  colonies.  The  percentage  of</span><span>  profit  from  those  in  Queensland  is  3-ss  ;</span><span>  in  South  Australia,  2-57  ;  in  New  Zea-</span><span>  land,  3""9i  ;  in  Victoria,  4/04  ;  in  New</span><span>  South  Wales,  5-31.  In  the  United  King</span><span>  domjthe  average  interest  earned  is  4-33</span><span>  per  cent.,  and  that  amount  our  railways</span><span>  shall  yield  next  year,  if  the  development</span><span>  of  traffic  continues  to  progress  at  the</span><span>  present  rate.</span></p> <p><span>  The  amount  of  money  expended  on</span><span>  our  railways  in  1882  was  £566,08$  from</span><span>  loan,  and  ,¿¿242,131  from  revenue.</span><span>  The  expenditure  from  revenue  for  en-</span><span>  gineers,  traffic,  and  locomotive  depart-</span></p> <p><span>  ments  on  the  several  lines  was-Southern</span></p> <p><span>  and  Western,  ,£151,229  !  Maryborough,</span><span>  ,£14,705  ;  Hnndaberg,  ,£6,672  ;  Central,</span><span>  ,£52,824;  Northern,  ¿16,698.  Thc</span></p> <p><span>  revenue  from  the  principal  lines</span><span>  has  been  as  follows  :  -  Southern</span></p> <p><span>  and  Western,  £130,231  ;  Central</span><span>  Railway,  ¿63,244;  Northern  Railway,</span><span>  £16,222.  The  expansion  of  the  Rail-</span><span>  way  Department,  and  the  encrcased</span><span>  business  done,  the  Commissioner  for</span><span>  Railways  points  out,  are  indicated  by</span><span>  ""an  increase  of  I2'i4  per  cent(of*tS*!$</span><span>  open  for  traffic  ;  an  increase  of  4ri  2  per</span><span>  cent  (371,763  miles)  in  the  train  miles</span><span>  run;  an  increase  of  4368  per  cent</span><span>  (174,764  tons),  in  thegoods  conveyed;  an</span><span>  increase  of  10477  per  cent  (259,080)  in</span><span>  the  number  of  passenger  tickets  issued  ;</span><span>  an  increase  of  17'52  per  cent  (9420)  in</span><span>  the  number  of  bales  of  wool  carried  ;  an</span><span>  increase  of  33-15  pei  cent,  (£115,570)  in</span><span>  the  gross  earnings  ;  an  increase  ol  23-99</span><span>  per  cent  (£46,852)  in  the  working  ex-</span><span>  penditure;  an  increase  of  10-94  per</span><span>  cent  (7)  in  the  locomotive  stock  ;  an  in-</span><span>  crease  of  14-29  per  cent  (13)  in  passenger</span><span>  vehicles,  and  an  increase  of  16-47  Per</span><span>  cent  (143)  in  goods  and  oilier  vehicles.""</span></p> <p><span>  From  a  comprehensive  table  included</span><span>  in  the  report  we  learn  that  the  number  of</span><span>  miles  of  railway  open  in  the  colony  in</span><span>  1SS2  was  898,  97  having  been  opened</span><span>  in  the  course  of  the  year,  and  340  being</span><span>  under  construction.  The  cost  per  mile</span></p> <p><span>  opened  was  ¡£6954.  The  total  earnings</span><span>  was  ,£464,160,  and  the  expenditure</span><span>  ,£242,131.  The  average  earnings  per'</span><span>  train  mile  run  was  7s.  3#d.;  on  the</span><span>  Central  Railway  theearniugs  was  8s.  io  J^d</span><span>  per  mile.

The  per  centage  of  working</span><span>  expenses  to  earnings  was  smallest  on  thc</span><span>  Central  Railway,  where  it  amounted</span><span>  to  45*51;  while  the  average  for  the</span><span>  colony  was  52'17.</span></p> <p><span>  No  serious  accident  occurred  on  any</span><span>  of  our  railways  in  1882  ;  but  that</span><span>  is  not  a  remark  the  Commissioner</span><span>  will  be  privileged  to  make  next</span><span>  year.  The  Sandgate  Railway  accident</span><span>  will  call  for  comment  and  ex-</span><span>  planation  in  next  report.  It  is  far</span><span>  from  satisfactory  to  find  the  Com-</span><span>  missioner  complaining  about  the  want  of</span><span>  rolling  stock  for  the  Bundaberg  and</span><span>  Maryborough  lines.  The  same  com-</span><span>  plaint  might  be  made  about  the  supply</span><span>  of  passenger  carriages  for  the  Central</span><span>  Railway.  On  holiday  occasions,  when  a</span><span>  demand  is  made  by  Sabbath  School</span><span>  children,  or  any  large  number  of  the</span><span>  public  upon  the  railway,  the  deficiency</span><span>  of  carriages  at  once  becomes  apparent,</span><span>  During  last  year  only  seven  engines  and</span><span>  thirteen  carriages  were  added  to  the</span><span>  rolling  stock  of  our  railways,  though</span><span>  nearly  a  hundred  miles  had  been  opened</span><span>  for  traffic.  List  year  the  number  of</span></p> <p><span>  locomotives  was  increased  from  fourteen</span></p> <p><span>  to  sixteen  ;  but  only  one  passenger</span><span>  carriage  has  been  added  since  1880.</span><span>  With  the  exception  of  cattle  waggons,</span><span>  the  number  of  which  has  been  increased</span><span>  from  six  to  twelve,  there  has  been  no</span><span>  material  additions  to  the  rolling  stock  of</span><span>  the  Central  Railway  for  the  last  three</span><span>  years.  The  recently  made  new  waggons,</span><span>  &c,  were  urgently  called  for.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  are  informed  by  the  Treasurer  of  the</span><span>  Hospital  that  the  collections  at  St.  Paul's</span><span>  Church  on  Sunday  last  amounted  to  £18</span></p> <p><span>  lCs.  9d.</span></p> <p><span>  MR.

It  gave  way  suddenly  011  Sunday</span><span>  morning  to  such  an  extent  that  tho  lockup</span><span>  keeper  IB  unable  to  open  the  front  door.  It  is</span><span>  hoped  that  something  will  at  once  bo  done  to</span><span>  remedy  thc  present  condition  of  the  building,</span><span>  as  it  is  unsafe  for  a  person  to  sleep  in  such  a</span></p> <p><span>  place.</span></p> <p><span>  ,/  THE  annual  tea  meeting  ia  connection  with</span><span>  rthe~~B«pti8t  Church  took  place  lost  night.</span></p> <p><span>  There  was  a  large  attendance  at  the  tea,  which</span><span>  ?was  provided  by  the  members  of  thc  church,</span></p> <p><span>  and  superintended  by  tfje  ladies.  The  church</span></p> <p><span>  was  nicely  decorated  with  flowers  and  ever-</span><span>  greens,  and  over  the  pulpit  was  the  word</span><span>  ""  Welcome.""  After  full  justice  had  been  done</span><span>  to  the  excellent  tea  provided  the  church  was</span><span>  cleared,  and  a  puhlic  meeting  was  held.</span><span>  The  Rev.  G.  Slade  occupied  the  chair,</span><span>  and  there  were  on  the  platform,  the  Hevs.</span><span>  A.  Hay,  T.  Jones,  D.  Mossop,  R.  Hartley,</span><span>  and  W.  H.  Williams.  Tho  meeting</span><span>  was  commenced  by  thc  singing  of  a  hymn,  and</span><span>  prayer  by  the  Hov.  lt.  Hartley.  The  Chair-</span><span>  man  delivered  a  suitable  address,  thanking</span><span>  those  present  for  their  attendance.  He  called</span><span>  on  the  Secretary  to  read  tho  report  and</span><span>  balance-sheet.  Mr.  A.  Card  read  tho  report,</span><span>  which  showed  that  during  tho  year  thc  church</span><span>  had  steadily  aud  unostentatiously  proceeded</span><span>  with  its  work  iu  all  branches,  and  was  able  to</span><span>  report  that  steady  perseverance  in  good  doing</span><span>  had  been  rewarded  with  encouraging</span><span>  success.  The  roll  of  membership  had</span><span>  boen  perceptibly  increased,  whilst  thc</span><span>  cougrogation  also  had  received  marked</span><span>  accessions  in  point  of  numbers.  The  admis-</span><span>  sions  to  the  church  during  the  year  by</span><span>  confession  of  faith  had  been  five,  and  by</span><span>  transfer  from  sister  churches  in  England  and</span><span>  tlic  colony  thirteen.  The  Sabbath  Schools</span><span>  both  in  Dcnison-strcet  and  North  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  had  made  satisfactory  advances.</span><span>  Owing  to  migration  the  congregation  at  North</span><span>  Rockhampton  which  had  been  decreased  in</span><span>  numbers  had  of  late  exhibited  an  encouraging</span><span>  increase  in  thc  attendance.  The  Baptist</span><span>  periodical  still  met  with  a  cordial  reception</span><span>  from  the  members  of  the  church  and  congre-</span><span>  gation.  Tho  Treasurer's  statement  would  show</span><span>  the  need  of  increased  liberality  on  the  part  of</span><span>  those  interested,  ami  it  was  hoped  that  when</span><span>  the  next  Treasurer's  statement  was  presented</span><span>  it  would  ho  of  a  more  encouraging  nature.</span><span>  Thc  young  men  of  the  Church  bad  formed  a</span><span>  union  of  a  most  important  nature,  and  the</span><span>  ladies'  sewing  meetings  had  also  been  success-</span><span>  fully  carried  on.  Much  of  the  succoss  was</span><span>  duo  to  the  indefatigable  labours  of  tho  Rev.</span><span>  G.  Slade.  lu  concision  the  report  expressed</span><span>  a  hope  that  the  successes  of  the  past  year</span><span>  might  urge  members  to  increased  zeal  and</span><span>  devotion  to  thc  Master's  cause,  and  thus  lead</span><span>  to  greater  aud  moro  glorious  results  in  thc</span><span>  future,  Tho  balance-sheet  showed  that  at  thc</span><span>  end  of  thc  last  church  year  there  was  an  over-</span><span>  draft  of  £S3  2s.  Cd.,  and  tho  expenditure</span><span>  during  tho  last  year  was  £324  2s.  I0J.</span><span>  The  receipts  were  £304  7«.  2d.,  thus</span><span>  showing  a  deficit  for  the  year  of  £19  15s.  8d.,</span><span>  anil  an  indebtedness  of  £102  6s.  2,1.  Out  of</span><span>  the  donations,  amounting  to  £72,  £70</span><span>  bad  been  given  by  one  member  of</span><span>  tho  church,  Thc  report  of  the  Young</span><span>  Men's  Mission  showed  that  about  six</span><span>  months  ago  n  few  younjj  men  met  toji  tbcr  nt</span><span>  thc  Kev.  (i.  Slade's  house,  and  tho  idea  of</span><span>  forming  themselves  into  a  hand  was  gladly</span><span>  received,  rul«s  were  made,  and  a  president,</span><span>  treasurer,  and  secretary  chosen.  At  the  start</span><span>  the  re  were  nine  members,  but  two  of  them</span><span>  left  thc  town  shortly  after,  and  now  thc  num-</span><span>  ber  could  be  doubled.  At  that  time  ono</span><span>  cottage  and  n  Sunday  morning  prayer  meeting</span><span>  were  held,  which  were  well  attended,  and</span><span>  during  thc  Inst  few  months  thirj  wore</span><span>  eood  discussions,  reading*,  and  OHsays,</span><span>  together  willi  a  concert  and  coffee  supper,</span><span>  nil  nf  which  were  well  att.  ii  lc  I.

In  rank  first  in  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  ;  und  tn  do  thc  work  that  was</span><span>  necessary  it  was  desirable  to  have  a  hall,  a</span><span>  reading  room,  au  amusement  room,  a  cricket</span><span>  club,  aud  a  codee  room.  AU  that  required</span><span>  money,  whioh  was  ueoesaary  if  the  mission  was</span></p> <p><span>  to  go  ahead.

Addresses  were  delivered  by  the</span><span>  reverend  gentlemen  au  the  platform,  and</span><span>  anthems  were  sung  in  excellent  style  by  the</span><span>  choir  to  the  accompaniment  of  Miss  Davis  on</span><span>  the  harmonium.  During  the  evening  a</span><span>  collection  was  made  on  behalf  of  the  church.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  latest  arrivals  of  stock  at  Lake's</span><span>  Creek  are-20S  head  of  fats  from  Mr.  E.

He  was</span><span>  driving  along  Denisonstreet,  when  the  horse</span><span>  shied  at  one  dray  and  collided  with  another.</span></p> <p><span>  Lawn  was  thrown  from  the  box  seat  and</span></p> <p><span>  received  the  injuries  mentioned.  A  passenger</span><span>  on  the  cab  stopped  the  horse  after  it  bad  gone</span><span>  a  few  yards.  The  only  injury  to  the  cab  was</span><span>  the  breakage  of  a  lamp.  Lawn  was  taken  to</span><span>  his  residence  in  Alma-lane,  where  he  was</span><span>  attended  to  by  Dr.  Poland,</span></p> <p><span>  Two  gentlemen  were  rowed  off  to  a  steam</span><span>  boat  lying  in  mid-stream,  and  having  com-</span><span>  pleted  their  business,  were  left  in  charge  of</span><span>  the  boat  to  come  ashore.  They  were  both</span><span>  well  up  in  shipping  matters,  but  were  un-</span><span>  accustomed  to  thc  uso  of  the  oars.  The</span><span>  result  was  that  they  pulled  in  a  most  erratic</span><span>  manner  for  about  two  hours,  and  BB  there  was</span><span>  a  strong  tide  running  it  eventually  landed</span><span>  them,  not  at  tho  Corporation  Wharf,  the</span><span>  point  they  started  for,  but  near  the  Rocks.</span><span>  They  got  ashoro  after  footing  it  through  tho</span><span>  mud.

Of  course  they  are</span><span>  camped  where  there  are  a  number  of  Chinese</span><span>  who  supply  them  with  opium.  Tho  police</span><span>  ought  to  clear  them  outside  the  boundaries</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  town.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  dredge  Saurian  (says  thc  Maryborough</span><span>  Chronk'e  of  Saturday)  is  eipeotcd  to  finish</span><span>  during  the  ensuing  week  thc  cutting  near  tho</span><span>  mouth  of  tho  river,  to  which  lier  operations</span><span>  were  limited  by  thc  Harbours  and  Rivers</span><span>  Department.

Putting</span><span>  on  ono  siilo  for  thc  present  any  comment  on</span><span>  the  ""  sham  ""  which  has  been  perpetrated</span><span>  by  the  Government  in  connection  with  the</span><span>  six  months'  probationary  work  in  the  Mary</span><span>  river,  wc  may  call  attention  to  the  fact  that</span><span>  the  work  done  by  the  Saurian  is</span></p> <p><span>  practically  worthless  unleBs  a  little  more</span></p> <p><span>  is  undertaken.  It  is  not  too  much  to  ask  that</span><span>  the  Saurian  be  detained  for  six  weeks  or  so</span><span>  longer,  to  dredge  a  shingle  bar  so  as  to</span><span>  afford  an  ordinarily  safe  paBsage  for  thc</span><span>  steamers  which  now  daily  enter  or  leave  this</span><span>  port.  The  spot  is  doubtless  well-known  by</span><span>  the  harbour  authorities,  as  it  is  too  well</span><span>  known  by  the  shipmasters  trading  hither,  and</span><span>  we  deem  it  simply  our  duty  to  throw  out  thc</span><span>  foregoing  suggestion,</span></p> <p><span>  THE  fresh  plans  for  thc  proposed  lock-up</span><span>  and  police  quarters  at  North  Rockhampton</span><span>  aro  on  view  at  the  Clerk  of  Petty  Sessions'</span><span>  office.  In  the  first  plan  it  was  intended  thc</span><span>  structure  should  bc  of  brick,  but  no  one  ten-</span><span>  dered,  and  thc  presont  specification  contains</span><span>  details  respecting  a  wooden  building  with  a</span><span>  galvanized  iron  roof.  Thcro  will  bc  a  sitting</span><span>  aud  dining  room,  with  two  bodrootns  for  the</span><span>  senior-constable's  quarters.  The  other  por-</span><span>  tion  of  the  building  will  consist  of  a  con-</span><span>  stable's  bedroom,  and  two  cells  for  the</span><span>  accommodation  of  prisoners,  A  verandah</span><span>  will  run  the  length  of  the  bui'ding,  and</span><span>  another  will  abut  on  thc  back  quarters.  Tho</span><span>  plan  shows  no  kitchen  or  bathroom,  the  latter</span><span>  a  necessary  convenience  in  tho  tropics.  There</span><span>  are  fire-places  in  tho  sitting  and  dining  rooms,</span><span>  and  the  cooking  may  he  done  in  either  of</span><span>  those.  A  tank  at  thc  rear  of  the  building,</span><span>  estimated  to  contain  1000  gallons  of  water,</span><span>  will  provide  an  ample  supply  for  domestic  pur-</span><span>  poses.  On  paper  the  building  looks  very</span><span>  complete,  and  will  provo  a  handsome  addition</span><span>  to  the  north  Bide.</span></p> <p><span>  THERE  was  a  very  good  attendance  at  the</span><span>  Theatre  Royal  last  night,  Donizetti's  opera</span><span>  ""Lucrczia  Borgia""  being  the  attraction.  The</span><span>  grand  music  in  this  opera  afforded  an  oppor-</span><span>  tunity  of  the  ability  of  tho  Montague-Turner</span><span>  troupe  to  render  a  heavy  work'in  an  adequate</span><span>  style.  Thc  argument  is  not  of  nn  entertaining</span><span>  character  on  account  nf  its  tragio  inci-</span><span>  dents,  Lucrczia  Borgia  being  oompollcd</span><span>  by  her  husband  to  poison  her  illegitimate</span><span>  son  Gennaro.  Miss  Montague,  in  the  title  rule,</span><span>  appeared  to  great  advantage,  her  acting  in</span><span>  each  scene  being  excellentand  in  keeping  with</span><span>  tho  character.  Her  vocalism  was  quite  a</span><span>  treat,  and  in  the.lighter  arias,  such  OB  in  the</span><span>  slumbering  scene  with  Gennaro,  sho  was  much</span><span>  appreciated.  In  thc  duct  with  thc  Duke  and</span><span>  thc  lina!  act  where  Gennaro  dies,  M  ¡SB</span><span>  Montague  wns  rapturously  applauded.  Mr.</span><span>  Turner  was  somewhat  hoarse  in  thc  opening</span><span>  seine,  but  this  wore  off  and  he  Bang  thc</span><span>  remainder  of  tho  music  with  much  taste</span></p> <p><span>  and  feeling,  Mr.  Browning  made  a  very  im</span><span>  posiug  Duke  and  his  rich  baritone  voice  had</span><span>  full  display  in  tho  Vendetta  song.

"<p><span>  KOCK.  HAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUIiSDAY,  AUGUST  21,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  electors  of  the  Leichhardt  district</span><span>  have  had  the  views  of  the  candidates</span></p> <p><span>  soliciting  their  suffrages  fairly  placed</span><span>  before  them,  and  need  have  no  difficulty</span><span>  in  determining  for  whom  they  will  vote.</span><span>  They  are  not  left  in  any  doubt  as  to</span><span>  the  political  faith  of  the  gentlemen</span><span>  emulous  of  representing  them.  Mr.</span><span>  Scott  does  not  conceal  the  fact  that  he</span><span>  is  a  Government  man,  and  he  does  not</span><span>  shirk  from  declaring  that  he  will  give</span><span>  them  his  support  in  their  projected</span><span>  I  schemes  for  the  promotion  of  the  pros-</span></p> <p><span>  perity  of  the  colony.  Rather  than  that</span><span>  I  the  colony  should  be  slowly  sadled</span><span>  with-  an  enormous  burden  of  debt,  he</span><span>  will  agree  to  the  construction  of  railways</span><span>  on  the  land-grant  principle.  In  coming</span><span>  to  this  conclusion,  Mr.  Scott  is  acting</span><span>  prudently  and  wisely.  In  recognising</span><span>  the  principle  he  is  admitting,  what  so</span><span>  many  candidates  fail  to  see,  there  is  a</span><span>  power  of  good  in  the  system.  This</span><span>  [  was  so  generally  recognised,  when  thc</span></p> <p><span>  Railway  Companies  Preliminary  Bill  was</span><span>  before  Parliament,  that  it  is  difficult  to</span><span>  understand  the  great  antagonism  that  is</span><span>  shown  to  it  now,  in  any  other  way  than</span><span>  by  concluding  it  has  been  fostered  for</span><span>  selfish  or  party  purposes.  The  idea  of</span><span>  paying  for  railways  with  our  waste  lands</span><span>  commended  such  a  system  to  everyone.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Griffith  said  the  main  point  to  be</span><span>  looked  to  was,  thal  the  enhanced  value</span><span>  of  the  land  near  the  railway  so  made,</span><span>  was  equal  to  the  bonus  given  for  its  con-</span><span>  struction.  Other  prominent  members</span><span>  of  the  Opposition  spoke  strongly  in</span><span>  favour  of  the  principle.  Now,  the</span><span>  objection  has  been  raised,  that  the</span><span>  system  would  lead  to  the  formation  of</span><span>  large  freehold  estates  ;  but  that  is  a  mere</span><span>  speculation.  The  proprietors  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  alternate  blocks  would  not  retain  them</span><span>  for  their  own  use.  They  would  dispose</span><span>  of  them  in  such  a  way  that  the</span><span>  traffic  on  the  railway  would  be</span><span>  promoted  by  their  occupation,  either  as</span><span>  arable  farms,  sheep  runs,  or  mineral</span><span>  lands.  The  line-owners,  for  their  own</span><span>  interest,  would  see  that  .  the  country</span><span>  was  put  to  the  best  uses  possible.  As</span><span>  we  have  already  remarked,  land-grant</span><span>  railways  may  be  made  on  terms  highly</span><span>  advantageous  to  the  colony,  and  un-</span><span>  accompanied  by  the  dangers  which  the</span><span>  opponents  of  the  system  imagine.  Mr.</span><span>  Scott  is  liberal  in  his  ideas  on  the</span><span>  coloured  labour  question,  and,  rather</span><span>  than  our  rising  and  most  important</span><span>  agricultural  industry  should  perish,  he</span><span>  would  permit  the  employment  of  Coolies.</span><span>  He  points  out  how  at  any  time,  should</span><span>  difficulties  arise,  the  importation  of  this</span><span>  class  of  workers  could  at  once  be  put  a</span><span>  slop  to.  The  debt  under  which  the</span><span>  colony  lies  to  the  present  Administra-</span><span>  tion  for  their  management  of  our</span><span>  finances,  is  a  subject  on  which  some  of</span><span>  their  firiends  have  had  nothing  to</span><span>  say  on  this  occasion,  and  Mr.  Scott</span><span>  does  well  in  calling  attention  to  the</span><span>  obligations  of  the  electors  in  this</span><span>  matter.  When  we  have  the  financial</span><span>  affairs  of  an  older  and  richer  colony  in</span><span>  such  a  state,  that  the  working  men  ol</span><span>  the  capital  admit  there  is  no  other  way</span><span>  out  of  their  troubles  save  by  taxation,  we</span></p> <p><span>  must  give  great  credit  to  our  Govern-</span><span>  ment  for  their  management  of  the</span><span>  finances.  Though  Mr.  Scott  has  not</span><span>  much  interest  in  the  Leichhardt  now  he</span><span>  is  a  local  man.  He  is  bound  up  in  its</span><span>  affairs  by  many  old  associations,  and  his</span></p> <p><span>  claims  on  the  electors  are  of  such  a</span></p> <p><span>  character,  we  feel  confident  they  will  not</span></p> <p><span>  be  overlooked,  and  that  he  will  be  re-  I</span></p> <p><span>  turned  at  the  head  of  the  poll.  I</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Dutton  comes  forward  as  an</span><span>  opponent  of  the  land-grant  principle,  as</span><span>  applied  to  railway  construction,  and  as</span></p> <p><span>  an  exponent  of  the  new  gospel  on  the  ¡</span><span>  land  question.  This  candidate  takes  an</span><span>  unfair  advantage  of  his  Ministerial</span><span>  opponent,  by  importing  the  terms  of  the</span><span>  Agreement  on  the  Transcontinental</span><span>  Railway  Scheme  into  thc  discussion.</span></p> <p><span>  These  are  not  before  the  electors.  Par-</span><span>  liament  condemned  that  scheme.  It</span><span>  has  been  withdrawn  ;  and  it  is  evidently</span><span>  unjust  in  Mr.  Dutton  lo  dwell  upon  it  in</span><span>  the  way  lie  has  been  doing.  His  objec-</span><span>  tion  that  land-grant  r.iilways  would  lead</span><span>  to  the  formation  of  large  estates  is  more</span><span>  reasonable  ;  but  it  comes  with  strange</span><span>  awkwardness  from  a  man  who  propanes</span><span>  the  leasing  ol  land  in  blocks  of  20,000</span><span>  acres.  Such  a  proceeding  nt  present</span><span>  would  go  a  long  way  to  the  aggregation</span><span>  of  these  large  estates,  the  formation  of</span><span>  which  he  dreads.  Mr.  Dutton  would</span></p> <p><span>  not  alienate  any  portions  ol  the  public</span><span>  estate.  He  would  substitute  a  system</span><span>  of  leasing.  Henry  George  and  Russell</span></p> <p><span>  Wallace  have  found  in  him  an  earnest  -</span></p> <p><span>  disciple,  and  he  is  entitled  to  credit</span><span>  lor  the  disingenuous  w.ty  he  advocates</span><span>  the  system.  It  looks  well  in  theory,</span></p> <p><span>  i  but  Mr.  Dutton  must  see  there  is</span></p> <p><span>  this  danger  in  his  scheme,  that</span><span>  when  leaseholders  have  entered  on  th  .se</span><span>  20,000  acre  blocks  he  speaks  of,  they</span><span>  will  use  their  all-powerful  interest  to</span><span>  obtain  pre-emptive  rights  to  the  land  ;</span><span>  they  will  return  representatives  pledged</span><span>  i  to  maintain  them  ia  their  holdings  ;  and</span></p> <p><span>  in  this  way  they  will  upset  the  leasing</span><span>  system.  It  has  been  stated  in  some</span><span>  quarters  that  this  greater  fixity  of  tenure,</span><span>  and  increase  of  pastoral  tents,  are  only</span><span>  advances  towards  the  ultimate  appropria-</span><span>  tion  of  our  western  lands.  There  are</span><span>  other  dangers  connected  with  the  radical</span><span>  change  in  our  lind  system,  proposed  by</span><span>  Mr.  Dutton,  Tvhicli  must  make  the</span><span>  electors  very  chary  about  giving  it  their</span><span>  support.  Mr.  Dutton  speaks  in  qualified</span><span>  language  as  to  the  introduction  of</span><span>  Coolies,  and  would  confine  them  to</span><span>  sugar  plantations  if  they  are  allowed  to</span><span>  come  at  all.  Having  large  interests  in</span><span>  the  district  Mr.  Dutton  possesses  claims</span><span>  on  the  electors,  which  are  entitled  to</span><span>  their  favourable  consideration.</span></p> <p><span>  Both  Mr.  Scott  and  Mr.  Dutton  are</span><span>  gentlemen  of  independent  means,  who</span><span>  will  be  able  to  give  their  time  and</span><span>  attention  to  the  political  interests  of  the</span><span>  constituency,  without  fear  or  favour.</span><span>  They  are  their  own  masters.  As  much</span></p> <p><span>  cannot  be  said  of  Mr.  raul.  He  would,</span><span>  no  doubt,  as  far  as  he  could  serve  the</span><span>  constituency  :  but  it  is  for  the  electors</span><span>  to  consider  whether  he  would  be  entirely</span><span>  free  of  the  influence  of  the  company  or</span><span>  syndicate,  with  which  he  is  associated.</span><span>  Besides,  circumstances  might  arise  which</span><span>  would  '  necessitate  his  departure  for</span><span>  New  South  Wales  again,  and  no  one</span><span>  can  say  when  a  new  election  might  be-</span><span>  come  necessary.  Mr.  Paul's  views  on</span><span>  the  political  questions  of  the  day  are  not</span><span>  such  as  should  commend  him  to  the</span><span>  electors  of  the  Leichhardt.  On  the</span><span>  land-grant  railway  principle  his  senti-</span><span>  ments  are  analagous  to  those  of  Mr.</span><span>  Dutton  ;  and  his  strong  opinions  on  the</span><span>  Coolie  question  will  not  be  shared  by</span><span>  electors,  who  have  no  need  for  coloured</span><span>  labour.  It  is  idle  for  Mr.  Paul  to  attri-</span><span>  bute  our  present  prosperity  entirely  to  a</span><span>  succession  of  good  seasons,  when  he</span><span>  knows  the  colony  has  been  able  to</span><span>  benefit  from  them  to  a  greater  extent,  in</span><span>  consequence  of  our  Mail  Service,  and</span><span>  careful  management  of  the  finances  and</span><span>  public  works  of  the  colony,  than  it  would</span><span>  otherwise  have  done.

"<p><span>  «OCiyfÁMr'TON.</span></p> <p><span>  FBJÓAY.  AUGUST  31,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  PVsr  Liberal  contemporaries  are  be-</span><span>  ginning  to  ""  hallo  before  they  are  out  of</span><span>  the  wood"":  they  are  ""counting  their</span><span>  chickens  before  they  are  hatched.""  In</span><span>  other  words,  before  one  half  of  the  elec-</span><span>  tions  are  over,  they  are  beginning  to</span><span>  j  count  the  majority  by  which  the  Ministry</span><span>  !  will  be  defeated  when  Parliament  re</span><span>  1  assembles.  Such  a  procceedirjg  will</span><span>  mislead  very  few  people,  and  if  it  pleases</span><span>  I  our  contemporaries  to  engage  in  it  we</span><span>  have  no  objections.  At  the  same  time</span><span>  they  anticipate  that  Mr.  Griffith  will  be</span><span>  able  to  form  a  capable  Ministry,  and  will</span><span>  inaugurate  a  public  policy  fraught  with</span><span>  great  good  to  the  community.  We  wish</span><span>  we  could  share  such  anticipations,  for</span><span>  there  can  be  no  doubt  the  colony  desires</span><span>  a  change  of  Government,  and  it  is  always</span><span>  possible  for  a  new  party  in  power,  follow-</span><span>  ing  the  direction  indicated  by  public</span><span>  opinion,  to  devise  ne«'  and  commendable</span><span>  schemes.  When  we  look  to  the</span><span>  leader  of  the  Opposition  himself,</span><span>  we  cannot  recognise  that  the</span><span>  colony  has  in  him  a  master-mind,</span><span>  capable  of  devising  administrative</span><span>  measures,  such  as  the  New  Mail  Service</span><span>  has  proved  to  be,  for  the  development</span><span>  of  the  material  interests  of  the  colony.</span><span>  The  hon.  gentleman  has  never  shown</span><span>  that  he  possesses  the  inventive  faculty,</span><span>  which,  when  the  occasion  demands,</span><span>  enables  the  person  endowed  with  it  to</span><span>  form  plans,  and  carry  them  out  to  a  suc-</span><span>  cessful  fulfilment.  Critical  ability  is</span><span>  the  strong  feature  in  Mr.  Griffith's</span><span>  character,  but  we  all  know  it  is  much</span><span>  easier  to  point  out  the  weakness  of  a</span></p> <p><span>  scheme  or  a  measure,  than  to  construct</span></p> <p><span>  the  one  or  draw  the  other.  He  will  ¡</span><span>  probably  himself  take  the  position  of</span></p> <p><span>  Colonial  Secretary,  which  will  involve  ¡</span><span>  attention  to  the  affairs  of  immigration,  I</span><span>  i  registration,  police,  prisons,  boards  of  j</span></p> <p><span>  i  health,  lunacy,  &c.  From  his  know-  j</span><span>  '  ledge  and  experience  of  public  affairs,</span></p> <p><span>  the  hon.  gentleman  should  be  able  to  '</span></p> <p><span>  administer  the  department  effectively,  j</span></p> <p><span>  but  the  demands  on  his  time  and  atten-  '</span><span>  tion  in  connection  with  these  matters  will</span><span>  be  made  in  addition  to  the  pressure</span></p> <p><span>  arisim;  from  his  position  as  head  of  thc  j</span><span>  Government,  and  supposing  he  leaves  j</span></p> <p><span>  his  professional  practice  altogether</span></p> <p><span>  neglected.  It  is  not  to  be  expected,  we  :</span><span>  think,  that  the  hon.  gentlemen  shall  re-  j</span><span>  ceive  much  assistance  from  his  prospec-  j</span><span>  tive  colleagues.  As  to  their  earnestness  j</span></p> <p><span>  and  good  intentions,  we  have  not  the</span><span>  smallestdoubt,andonlywish  thcirabilities</span><span>  were  equal  to  these.  Mr.  Dickson  did  not</span><span>  distinguish  himself  as  Treasurer,  for</span><span>  when  he  entered  upon  office  in  1876</span><span>  there  was  a  surplus  in  the  public</span><span>  accounts  of  .£67,714;  in  the  following</span><span>  year  it  was  reduced  to  £15,291  ;  and</span><span>  the  first  year  the  present  Administration</span><span>  were  in  office  the  Treasury  had  been  so</span><span>  exhausted  lhere  was  a  deficit  of</span><span>  ;£z  16,807,  Either  Mr.  Garrick  or  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Rutledge  will  make  a  respectable</span><span>  Attorney-General,  but  we  look  in  vain</span><span>  for  gentlemen  on  the  Opposition  side</span><span>  capable  of  administering  either  the</span><span>  Department  of  Lands  or  Works.  Mr.</span><span>  Mein  will  fill  the  office  of  Postmaster</span><span>  General  with  advantage  to  the  com-</span><span>  munity,  and  credit  to  his  party.</span></p> <p><span>  While  we  do  not  anticipate  from  the</span><span>  ptrsonel  of  the  coming  Ministry  they</span><span>  will  he  capable  of  great  things,  we  can</span><span>  find  little  for  congratulation  in  the  pro-</span><span>  gramme,  which  Mr.  Griffith  laid  before</span><span>  the  country  at  the  beginning  of  the</span><span>  present  election  contest.  It  is  con-</span></p> <p><span>  tended  that  he  is  not  bound  to  show  his</span><span>  hand  till  he  is  called  upon  to  play,  but</span><span>  he  seems  to  have  been  of  a  different</span></p> <p><span>  opinion.  What  is  the  meaning  of  his</span><span>  message  to  the  constituencies,  as</span><span>  his  election  Address  may  be  called,</span><span>  if  it  does  not  foreshadow  very</span><span>  plainly  the  works  policy  he  intends  to</span><span>  pursue.  It  seems  to  be  concluded  by</span><span>  our  opponents  that  the  land-grant  rail-</span><span>  way  principle,  and  the  coloured  labour</span><span>  question,  have  been  consigned  in  thc</span><span>  meantime  to  the  limbo  of  condemned</span><span>  schemes  ;  but  the  country  may  depend</span><span>  upon  it  they  will  not  be  allowed  to  re-</span><span>  main  dormant  for  long.  The  land-grant</span><span>  principle  has  not  been  abandoned.  Sir</span><span>  Thomas  M'Uwraith  has  declared  it  shall</span><span>  form  a  prominent  plank  of  his  platform</span><span>  in  the  future  ;  and,  when  the  necessity</span><span>  for  its  application  becomes  more  ap-</span><span>  parent,  the  electors  will  educate  them-</span><span>  selves,  and  have  a  better  understanding</span><span>  of  how  it  may  be  applied  with  advantage</span><span>  to  promote  the  affairs  of  this  colony.</span><span>  The  sugar  interest,  again,  is  too  large  and</span><span>  important  to  suffer  obstruction  by  the</span><span>  intervention  of  legislative  restrictions  of</span><span>  the  kind  proposed.  If  planters  cannot</span><span>  get  Coolies  they  will  import  Chinese,</span><span>  and  a  steady  stream  of  these  will  soon</span><span>  tell,  not  only  on  the  sugar  industry,  but</span></p> <p><span>  on  every  other  in  the  colony.  Those</span><span>  who  speak  in  an  indefinite  way  of  Mr.</span><span>  Griffith  having  great  things  in  store  for</span><span>  tis,  roust  have  forgot  that  on  the</span><span>  main  topics  of  political  interest  he  has</span><span>  already  formulated  his  views,  and  indi-</span><span>  cated  his  policy.  He  tells  us  himself</span><span>  that  two  of  the  most  urgent  questions,</span><span>  which  can  engage  the  attention  of  the</span><span>  electors  in  a  young  and  undeveloped</span><span>  country  ol  large  extent  like  Queensland,</span><span>  are  emigration,  and  the  means  of  com-</span><span>  munication.  With  regard  to  the</span><span>  first  of  these,  he  proposes  to</span><span>  introduce  white  labour  al  the  rate</span><span>  of  about  forty  thousand  persons</span><span>  annually.  As  the  vast  majority  of  immi-</span><span>  grants  come  here  without  capital,  and</span><span>  without  the  means  of  taking  up  land  and</span><span>  ""bccupying  it,  employment  for  them  must</span><span>  be  lound  on  public  works.  The  colony</span><span>  will,  therefore,  have  to  Providern,</span><span>  immense  sum  of  moneytoja^rf^oiir</span><span>  in  this  way,  and  ^tffTarger  sums  to</span><span>  furnish  it  with  enjoyment,  if  it  is  to  be</span><span>  retained  jp  viii  colony.  This  outlay,  it</span><span>  is  calefied,  will  be  met  by  the  increased</span><span>  r£KSiue  an  dutiable  goods-that  is  to</span></p> <p><span>  say  on  spirits  chiefly.  It  must  be</span><span>  perfectly  plain,  however,  to  any  one,  who</span><span>  looks  beyond  the  immediate  future,  to</span><span>  see  that  such  a  policy  is  fraught</span><span>  with  roany  evils.  It  will  tend  to</span><span>  fill  the  country  with  people  de-</span><span>  pendent  on  Government  for  their</span><span>  daily  bread.  They  will  look  to  the</span><span>  central  authorities  for  employment,  and</span><span>  will  place  and  retain  in  power  those  who</span><span>  are  most  liberal  in  providing  occupation</span><span>  for  them.  Evidences  of  the  evils</span></p> <p><span>  attending  this  system  exist  here  already,</span><span>  and  their  multiplication  ought  not  to  be</span><span>  encouraged.  Of  course,  it  may  be  con-</span><span>  tended  that  settlement  will  keep  pace</span><span>  with  the  expenditure  on  immigration  and</span><span>  public  works,  but  that  seems  to  be  ex-</span><span>  ceedingly  doubtful.  Observation  of  what</span><span>  has  taken  place  already  does  not  go  far</span><span>  to  warrant  such  an  expectation.  It  is</span><span>  not  a  thing  that  can  be  relied  on  with</span></p> <p><span>  !  any  degree  of  certainty  as  to  its  fulfil-</span><span>  ment.  There  is  as  much  reason  to</span><span>  apprehend  danger  as  advantage  from  it.</span></p> <p><span>  j  Such  immigration,  moreover,  as  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Griffith  proposes,  will  not  meet  the</span><span>  demand  for  labour,  which  proceeds  (rom</span><span>  our  most  promising  industry.  The  im</span><span>  :  portation,  therefore,  of  what  may  be</span></p> <p><span>  regarded,  to  a  considerable  extent,  as</span><span>  unproductive  labour,  may  be  attended</span><span>  with  very  serious  consequences.  Then,</span><span>  with  regard  to  means  of  communica-</span><span>  tion-the  other  great  question  to  which</span><span>  Mr.  Griffith  refers-his  views  will  not</span><span>  commend  them  to  the  electors,  for</span><span>  they  are  vague  and  indefinite.  He</span></p> <p><span>  declares  that  the  trunk  lines  must  be</span><span>  carried  further  west,  and  at  the  same</span><span>  time  confesses  coast  lines  are  urgently</span><span>  needed.  The  former  he  will  carry  orr</span><span>  by  means  of  loans,  if  he  can  raise  the</span><span>  money  ;  the  latter  by  a  guarantee</span><span>  system.  He  adopts  the  policy  of  his</span><span>  political  opponents,  and  substitutes  a</span><span>  guarantee  for  land-grants,  in  connection</span><span>  with  the  western  extensions.  Having</span><span>  let  the  electors  into  his  confidence  on</span><span>  these  matters,  Mr.  Griffith  cannot  get</span><span>  away  from  them.  He  must  embody  his</span><span>  views  in  any  scheme  he  may  propound.</span><span>  They  may  be  more  attractive  when</span><span>  explained  and  discussed  at  some  length,</span><span>  but  in  the  meantime,  we  look  upon  them</span><span>  with  little  hope,  and  less  confidence.</span></p> ",Article,1883-08-31,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  SEPTEMBER  4,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THOSE  of  our  citizens,  who,  on  Sunday</span></p> <p><span>  last  heard  a  rumour  that  several  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  recent  arrivals  by  the  mail  steamer  Duke</span><span>  of  Westminster,  and  immigrant  ship</span><span>  Nebo,  had  been  taken  to  the  Hospital,</span><span>  smitten  with  small-pox  ;  and  who  gave</span><span>  ready  credence  to  the  story,  evidently  had</span><span>  a  correct  and  well-grounded  apprehension</span><span>  of  what  might  have  been  the  case.</span><span>  They  were  evidently  alive  to  the  danger</span><span>  of  the  situation.  It  is  greatly  to  be  re-</span><span>  gretted,  we  think,  that  the  authorities,  on</span><span>  whom  we  depend  to  protect  us  from</span><span>  such  a  calamity,  are  not  equally  alive  to</span><span>  the  critical  circumstances  in  which  this</span><span>  community  has  been  placed.  We  are</span><span>  quite  prepared  to  hear  at  any  moment</span><span>  that  small-pox  has  broken  out  in  our</span><span>  midst,  or  that  it  has  been  carried  to  some</span><span>  of  our  inland  townships,  and  is  commit-</span><span>  ting  havoc  among  both  black  and</span><span>  white  men,  beyond  the  area  of  ordinary</span><span>  medical  practice.  The  apathy  of  the</span><span>  central  authorities,  with  regard  to  the</span><span>  danger  to  which  we  have  been  exposed,</span><span>  contrasts  very  unpleasantly  with  the</span><span>  activity  and  determination  they  have</span><span>  manifested  in  protecting  themselves.</span><span>  The  Duke  of  Westminster,  with  the  sick</span><span>  surgeon  on  board,  reached  Brisbane</span><span>  early  on  Tuesday  morning.  Imme-</span><span>  diately  upon  its  being  discovered  that</span><span>  Dr.  Woodward  was  ill,  and  that  there</span><span>  was  a  suspicion  of  small-pox,  the  utmost</span><span>  precautions  were  used.  The  ship  was</span><span>  quarantined;  the  immigrants  were  trans-</span><span>  ferred  to  Peel  Island  ;  and  the  medical</span><span>  officer  and  his  attendants  to  Bird  Island.</span></p> <p><span>  There  they  will  be  kept  till  all</span><span>  danger  be  past.  In  the  meantime,</span><span>  however,  a  large  consignment  of</span><span>  immigrants  had  landed  at  Rockhampton.</span><span>  They  were  brought  up  on  Sunday  even-</span><span>  ing,  and  at  once  mingled  freely  with  the</span><span>  immigrants  from  the  ship  Nebo,  who</span><span>  were  then  in  the  Immigration  Depot.</span><span>  It  must  have  been  perfectly  well  known</span><span>  to  the  Immigration  and  Health  Officers</span><span>  in  Brisbane  that  this  was  the  case.</span><span>  Nevertheless,  though  it  has  been  de-</span></p> <p><span>  clared  that  Dr.  Woodward  is  suffering  &nbsp;</span><span>  from  virulent  small-pox,  though  every</span></p> <p><span>  care  has  been  taken  to  guard  against  an  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  outbreak  in  Brisbane,  absolutely  nothing</span></p> <p><span>  has  been  done  to  keep  us  clear  of  the  &nbsp;</span><span>  disease,  or  prevent  its  dissemination.</span><span>  Our  Acting  Health  Officer  has  not</span></p> <p><span>  received  a  word  of  warning  or  advice.  &nbsp;</span><span>  Commenting  on  the  case  on  Wednesday  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  the  Brisbane  Courier  said  :</span></p> <p><span>  ""  The  arrival  of  tho  mail  steamer  Duke  of</span><span>  Westminister  with  small-pox  on  board  is  a</span><span>  serious  event.  If  we  are  correctly  informed,</span></p> <p><span>  that  no  health  officer  visited  the  steamer  in</span></p> <p><span>  Keppel  Bay,  there  was  culpable  negligence</span><span>  on  the  part  of  the  officer  entrusted  with  the</span><span>  duty  of  inspection.  It  appears  that  Dr.</span><span>  Woodward,  the  doctor  of  the  Duke  of  West</span><span>  minster,  who  is  now  unmistakably  suffering</span><span>  from  small-pox,  was  unwell  when  she  arrived</span><span>  in  Keppel  Bay,  and  the  passengers  for  Rock-</span><span>  hampton  were  being  disembarked,  but  it  was</span><span>  not  till  after  they  had  been  landed  that  the</span><span>  eruption  declared  itself.  Had  the  health</span></p> <p><span>  officer  visited  the  vessel,  he  would  probably</span><span>  have  seen  cause  to  delay  the  landing,  and</span><span>  thus  avoided  the  danger  which  now  exists,</span><span>  that  contagion  may  have  been  conveyed  to</span><span>  the  community  in  Rockhampton.  It  is  evi-</span><span>  dent  now  that  Dr.  Woodward  was  in  the  first</span><span>  stage  of  the  disease  when  the  steamer  arrived</span><span>  in  Keppel  Bay  -  a  stage  at  which  it  is at least</span><span>  possible  that  the  invalid  may  infect  others.</span><span>  At  the  same  time  the  symptoms  of  the  disease</span><span>  are  not  at  that  period  sufficiently  marked  to</span><span>  make  its  diagnosis  certain.  The  sufferer  may</span><span>  have  had  a  suspicion  of  the  true  nature  of</span><span>  his  complaint,  but  being  unsupported  by  the</span><span>  presence  of  the  officer,  whose  duty  it  was  to</span><span>  guard  against  thc  importation  of  infectious</span><span>  disease,  he  may  have  shrunk  from  incurring</span><span>  the  grave  responsibility  of  stopping  the  land-</span><span>  ing  of  the  immigrants.  The  extent  of  the</span><span>  mischief  done  -  if  any  - depends of course on</span><span>  the  manner  in  which  Dr.  Woodward  himself,</span><span>  caught  the  disease.  If  he,  as  is  supposed,</span><span>  was  infected  at  Batavia,  the  contagion  may</span><span>  have  been  confined  to  his  own  person  ;  and</span><span>  the  precaution-which  we  presume  will  be</span><span>  taken  -  of  gathering  and  isolating the immi-</span><span>  grants  at  Rockhampton,  will  be  sufficient  to</span><span>  insure  the  colony  against  the  spread  of  the</span><span>  disease.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  a  number  of</span><span>  passengers  were  exposed  to  the  same  chances  of</span><span>  contagion,  wc  may  hear  of  the  disease  making</span><span>  its  appearance  in  the  other  coast  towns, which</span><span>  received  batches  of  immigrants  by  the  Duke</span><span>  of  Westminister.""</span></p> <p><span>  On  Friday  the  Courier  modified  ""its</span><span>  statements  regarding  the  supposed</span><span>  direliction  of  duty  by  the  Health  officer</span><span>  at  Rockhampton.  It  then  explained</span><span>  that  the  fault,  which  has  exposed  us  to</span><span>  our  present  danger,  lies  not  with  the</span><span>  health  officer  at  this  port,  but  with  the</span><span>  Department.  The  rule  now  is  that  a</span><span>  steamer  arriving  at  a  northern  port  is</span><span>  there  inspected,  and  then  passes  down,</span><span>  as  a  coasting  steamer,  without  further</span><span>  inspection.  All  this  it  will  be  seen,</span><span>  increases  the  gravity  of  the  charge  we</span><span>  make  against  the  departmental authorities</span><span>  in  Brisbane,  that  they  have  been  culp-</span><span>  able  of  gross  neglect  of  our  health  and</span><span>  safety.  They  seem  to  have  been</span><span>  so  selfish  and  scared  they  could  think  only</span><span>  of  their  own  safety.  The  moment  it</span><span>  was  known  that  Dr.  Woodward  was  ill  of</span><span>  small  pox,  intimation  of  the  fact  should</span><span>  have  been  sent  to  all  the  ports  at  which</span><span>  emigrants  by  the  Duke  of  Westminster</span><span>  have  been  landed,  and  the  health  officers</span><span>  advised  as  to  what  steps  they  should  take,</span><span>  in  the  event  of  sickness  appearing  among</span><span>  the  new  chums.  While  putting  our  autho-</span><span>  rities  on  the  alert  a  few  useful  hints  might</span><span>  have  been  given.  We  are  sorry  to  say  we</span><span>  cannot  congratulate  our  readers  upon  all</span><span>  danger  being  past.  It  is  only</span><span>  about  a  week  since  Dr.  Woodward's</span><span>  case  was  pronounced  to  be  one  of</span><span>  small-pox,  hut  he  was  ill  long  before  he</span></p> <p><span>  reached  Brisbane.  When  at  Cooktown</span><span>  he  was  complaining,  and  a  rush  came</span><span>  out  upon  him  at  that  time.  There  can</span><span>  be  no  doubt  he  had  the  disease  about</span><span>  him,  when  sending  off  the  emigrants  to</span><span>  the  different  ports.  He  is  very  much</span><span>  to  blame  for  not  having  summoned</span><span>  medical  assistance,  which  he  could</span><span>  easily  have  done  hy  telegraph.  Our</span></p> <p><span>  health  officer  could  then  have  visited  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  him  at  Keppel  Bay.  It  will  occur  to</span><span>  many  to  ask  where  did  Dr.  Woodward</span><span>  catch  contagion  ?  The  Courier  suggests</span><span>  that  he  may  have  done  so  at  Batavia.</span><span>  In  that  event  he  must  have  carried  it</span><span>  about  with  him  for  ten  days  - the time</span><span>  taken  by  the  steamer  on  the  voyage</span><span>  between  that  port  and  the  Queensland</span><span>  coast,  If  he,  a  medical  officer,  on  board</span><span>  a  large  ship,  with  all  manner  of  comforts,</span><span>  could  thus  be  an  involuntary  vehicle  of</span><span>  disease,  have  we  not  great  reason  to  fear</span><span>  that  the  immigrants,  with  whom  he  was</span><span>  coming  in  daily  contact,  may  be  the</span><span>  means  of  spreading  it  far  and  wide.</span><span>  We  are  not  out  of  danger,  and  while  we</span><span>  urge  upon  our  authorities  and  medical</span><span>  officers  the  duty  of  being  careful  and</span><span>  watchful,  we  would  insist  upon  personal</span></p> <p><span>  cleanliness  on  the  part  of  members  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  the  community,  and  the  free  use  of  &nbsp;</span><span>  disinfectants.  &nbsp;</span></p> ",Article,1883-09-04,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

This  is  merely  the  extension  of  a</span><span>  principle,  which  has  long  been  carried  out</span><span>  in  practice  in  the  home  countries.</span><span>  Small  parcels  such  as  watches,  jewellery,</span><span>  and  samples  have  always  been  trans</span><span>  missable,  at  rates  slightly  in  excess  of</span><span>  those  charged  for  letters  of  equal  weight.</span><span>  Under  the  new  system  the  charges  will</span><span>  be  for  a  parcel  not  exceeding  i  lb.,  3d.:</span><span>  above  1  lb.  and  not  exceeding  3  lb.,  6d.;</span><span>  above  3  lb.  and  not  exceeding  5  lb.,  od.;</span><span>  above  5  lb.  and  not  exceeding  7  lb.,  rs.</span><span>  The  result  of  the  change  will  be  watched</span><span>  with  much  interest,  because  already  it</span><span>  has  become  apparent  to  persons  familiar</span><span>  with  the  attempts  that  are  made  by</span><span>  citizens,  who  would  assume  a  very  indig-</span><span>  nant  air  if  their  loyalty  and  public-spirit</span><span>  were  questioned,  to  cheat  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  that  it  will  be  liable  to  abuse.</span><span>  The  sample  post  had  to  be  abandoned,</span><span>  because  dealers  instead  of  confining  their</span><span>  remittances  to  samples,  sent  goods  which</span><span>  had  been  ordered,  perhaps  by  post</span><span>  cards,  and  sold  on  credit.  Thus,  it  will</span><span>  be  seen  the  revenue  was  defrauded  in</span><span>  several  ways.  Attempts  were  also  to</span><span>  send  lelters  open  af  the  ends,  under  the</span><span>  guise  of  circulars,  at  the  cheap  rate,  and</span><span>  so  numerous  have  these  been  that  it</span><span>  has  paid  the  authorities  to  maintain  a</span><span>  special  stalT  of  assistants  to  detect  them,</span><span>  and  charge  the  penalties  incurred.  The</span><span>  income  earned  by  the  detectives</span><span>  has  more  than  paid  their  salaries.  In</span><span>  connection  with  the  new  parcels  post</span><span>  system,  it  is  pointed  out  that  a  person</span><span>  may  send  through  the  post  ten  parcels</span><span>  of  seven  pounds  each-in  all  seventy</span><span>  pounds  of  merchandise-at  a  cost  of</span><span>  ten  shillings.  In  this  way  the  service</span><span>  may  become  encumbered,  and  the  cost</span><span>  of  carrying  it  on  will  exceed  the  income.</span><span>  This  is  a  matter  on  which  experience</span><span>  will  furnish  the  required  information.</span><span>  Another  objection  to  the  system</span><span>  is  that  parcels  may  be  despatched</span><span>  containg  letters,  and  the  present  revenue</span><span>  of  the  Postal  Service  will  thereby  be</span><span>  reduced.  Here  again  the  results  must</span><span>  be  learned  from  experience.  It  may  be</span><span>  difficult  to  ascertain  to  what  extent  the</span><span>  parcels  are  laden  with  letters,  but  if  the</span><span>  letter-postage  revenue  is  greatly  affected,</span><span>  and  a  reduction  is  apparent,  the  con-</span><span>  clusion  that  letters  are  being  sent  in</span><span>  parcels  will  be  obvious.</span></p> <p><span>  Among  the  reasons  which  may  have</span><span>  induced  the  Post  Office  authorities  in</span><span>  the  United  Kingdom  to  inaugurate  this</span><span>  parcels  post  system,  the  great  convenience</span></p> <p><span>  it  will  be  to  the  nublic  was  doubtless</span></p> <p><span>  thc  most  prominent.  Railways  have</span><span>  run  staRe-coaches  and  carriers'  wains</span><span>  olT  the  highways  and  byways  of  the  old</span><span>  country.  In  many  outlying  localities</span><span>  the  rural  postman-trudging  on  foot,  or</span><span>  perhaps  doing  his  journey  in  a  spring</span><span>  cart,-is  the  only  means  of  communica-</span><span>  tion  with  the  t;reat  centres  of  commerce</span><span>  and  trade.  Orders  for  articles  may  be</span><span>  sent  by  post  from  any  patt  of  the</span><span>  country,  but  the  difficulties  of  fulfilling</span><span>  such  orders  for  want  of  carriage  accom</span></p> <p><span>  modation  are  in  many  cases  insuperable.</span><span>  No  public  conveyances  run  to  small</span><span>  villages  and  country  houses.  To  enable</span><span>  the  postman  to  carry  parcels  the</span><span>  Postal  authorities  will  require  to</span><span>  furnish  them  with  vehicles.  When  they</span><span>  do  this  they  will  secure  nearly  all  the</span><span>  carrying  trade  for  light  articles,  and  pro-</span><span>  vide  a  system  that  will  be  of  immense</span><span>  advantage  to  residents  outside  of  towns</span><span>  and  beyond  the  reach  of  railways.  Its</span><span>  benefits  will  be  most  felt  in  those  parts</span><span>  of  the  country  to  which  the  iron  horse</span><span>  has  not  penetrated.</span></p> <p><span>  A  consideration  of  this  fact  must  raise</span><span>  the  enquiry-whether  a  useful  and  remu-</span><span>  nerative  parcels  post  system  could  not</span><span>  be  established  in  this  colony?  The</span><span>  difficulties  attending  the  transmission</span><span>  of  small  parcels  from  one  part</span><span>  of  the  colony  to  another  are  at</span><span>  present  very  numerous.  Indeed,  the</span><span>  danger  of  total  loss  is  so  great  that  trade</span></p> <p><span>  in  this  way  is  seriously  hampered.  It».:</span><span>  the  United  Kingdom  Parcel  Delivery</span><span>  Companies  undertake  the  carriage  of</span><span>  Parcels  from  London  to  almost  any  part</span><span>  of  the  civilised  world.  These  companies</span><span>  have  been  making  the  trade  which  the</span><span>  Government  have  resolved  to  prosecute.</span><span>  We  have  no  Parcel  Delivery  Companies</span><span>  in  this  colony,  and  there  is  the  greater</span><span>  reason,  therefore,  why  the  Government</span><span>  should  undertake  this  service  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  public  interest.  We  are  not  prepared  to</span><span>  say  it  could  be  efficiently  carried  oûTtô""""</span><span>  all  parts  of  the  colony,  because  the</span><span>  number  and  aggregate  weight  of  parcels,</span><span>  newspapers,  and  letters  would  increase</span><span>  on  many  routes,  beyond  the  carrying</span><span>  capabilities  of  a  single  horse  ;  and  on</span><span>  many  lines  of  travel  the  roads  would  be</span><span>  impassable  for  vehicles.  Wherever</span><span>  Cobb's  coaches  travel,  and  wherever  the</span><span>  mails  are  conveyed  by  coach  the</span></p> <p><span>  Parcels  Post  could  be  introduced.</span><span>  Little  need  be  said  to  show  how</span></p> <p><span>  greatly  trade  might  be  stimulated  by  it.</span><span>  Our  daily  journals  contain  long  lists  of</span><span>  articles  of  interest  and  utility,  of  novel-</span><span>  ties  and  specialities,  lo  which  merchants</span><span>  invite  the  attention  of.  customers.  But'</span></p> <p><span>  these  are  beyond  the  reach  of  persons'</span><span>  residing  on  inland  stations.  They  can</span><span>  only  be  procured  at  considerable  risk,</span><span>  trouble,  and  expense.  Suppose,  how-</span><span>  ever,  in  connection  with  the  Postal  De-</span><span>  partment  there  were  this  parcels</span><span>  .delivery  system,  anyone  could  write</span><span>  to  Rockhampton  or  Brisbane  for</span><span>  some  speciality  or  novelty  ;  the</span></p> <p><span>  merchant  there  could  meet  the  demand</span></p> <p><span>  by  transmitting  the  article  by  post,  con-</span><span>  fident  there  would  be  little  risk,  and  the</span><span>  least  possible  delay.  It  appears  to  us</span><span>  the  system  would  be  specially  useful  in</span><span>  facilitating  the  sale  of  medicines,  books,</span><span>  jewellery,  drapery,  &c.  In  cases  -of</span><span>  sickness  an  order  for  medicines,  sent,</span></p> <p><span>  perhaps,  by  telegraph,  would  be  fulfilled</span><span>  without  loss  of  time,  and  thus  suffering</span><span>  would  be  avoided  and  lives  spared.  As</span><span>  roads  were  opened  np,  and  the  coach</span><span>  routes  extended,  the  advantages  of  the</span><span>  system  could  be  carried  to  all  parts  of</span><span>  the  colony.  A  list  of  the  places  to</span><span>  which  the  Department  was  prepared  to</span><span>  undertake  the  delivery  of  parcels  could</span><span>  be  displayed  at  every  post-office  in  the</span><span>  colony,  and  thus  the  public  could  learn</span><span>  how  far  the  parcels  delivery  system</span><span>  could  be  available.  Our  Post  Office</span><span>  service  is  not  remunerative  at  present,</span><span>  but  it  seems  to  us  the  probabilities  of  a</span><span>  parcels  post  increasing  the  income  of</span><span>  the  Department  are  greater  in  this  colony</span><span>  than  in  the  United  Kingdom.  For</span><span>  these  reasons  it  is  to  be  hoped  the</span><span>  establishment  of  a  parcels  delivery</span><span>  system  in  connection  with  our  postal</span><span>  service  may  receive  the  attention  of  the</span><span>  public,  and  those  on  whom  rests  the</span><span>  duty  of  providing  means  for  the  develop-</span><span>  ment  of  trade,  and  the  multiplication  of</span><span>  the  comforts  of  the  community.</span></p> <p><span>  A  LTnoTjGH  the  old  opinion  llmt  leprosy  I'B</span><span>  contagious  ia  now  generally  discredited,  w«</span><span>  aro  very  glad  to  lenin,  upon  Dr.  Thurston's</span><span>  authority,  that  the  diseased  Chinaman  at</span><span>  Bogantungan  is  not  suffering  from  it.  lt  may</span><span>  be  hereditary  and  non-infectious,  but  we  have</span><span>  heen  informed  on  good  authority  that  sin  oe</span><span>  tho  Chinese  bogan  to  mix  with  the  South  Sea</span><span>  Islanders  it  has  appeared  and  become  common</span><span>  among  the  latter.  We  must  remember,  more-</span><span>  over,  that  in  tba  Middle  Ages  it  prevailed  in</span><span>  Europe,  and  there  were  at  one  time  19,000</span><span>  lazar  houses  for  the  reception  of  persons</span><span>  afflicted  by  it.  It  still  exists  on  the  west</span><span>  coast  of  Norway  ;  the  Baltic  provinces  of</span><span>  Russia  ;  in  certain  parts  ot  Spain  and  Por-</span><span>  tugal  ;  all  over  the  East  ;  in  the  West  Indies,</span><span>  mid  Central  America.  The  cause  of  it  is  un-</span><span>  known,  but  it  is  said  to  prevail  most  among</span><span>  persons  who  largely  uso  fish  diofc,  and  inter-</span><span>  marry  closely.

"<p><span>  RqCrtHAMl'l'ON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  JANUARY  29,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  question  of  the  validity  of  the  pro-</span><span>  ceedings  in  connection  with  the  late</span><span>  Municipal  elections  is  still  open,  not-</span><span>  withstanding  the  severe  logic  that  has</span><span>  been  brought  into  exercise  to  show  their</span><span>  legality.  Il  is  comeiiueii  mai,  uccauac</span><span>  Alderman  Sharples  had  not  been</span><span>  nominated  as  a  candidate  till  after  he</span><span>  had  issued  the  notice  for  the  election,</span><span>  that  he  was  quite  entitled  to  act  as</span><span>  Returning  Officer  till  the  day  of  nomina-</span></p> <p><span>  tion.  When  the  clause  in  the  Local</span></p> <p><span>  Government  Act  is  looked  at,  even  j</span><span>  cursorily,  it  will  be  seen  that  this  isa</span><span>  mistake.  It  distinctly  states  that  no</span><span>  person  shall  act  as  Returning  Officer  at</span><span>  any  election  who  shall  foi»;««  a  candidate</span><span>  at  such  election.  The  exact  words  of</span><span>  the  clause  are  :-""  no  person,  who  acts</span><span>  as  Returning  Officer  at  any  election,</span><span>  shall  be  ot  become  a  candidate  for  any</span><span>  office  at  such  election.""  Now  the</span></p> <p><span>  question  is  did  the  Mayor  (Mr.  Sharples)</span><span>  act  as  Returning  Officer  at  the  late</span><span>  election?  Unmistakably  lie  did  up  till</span><span>  within  a  few  hours  of  the  nomination.</span><span>  The  advertisement  notifying  the  election</span><span>  bore  his  name  as  Returning  Officer.</span><span>  Then  did  he  become  a  candidate  at  that</span><span>  election?  Unquestionably  he  did.</span><span>  Again,  if  the  Mayor  intending  to  become</span><span>  a  candidate  at  the  election,  did,  as</span><span>  Returning  Officer,  notify  the  election,  was</span><span>  such  notification  legal  ?  If  it  were  legal</span><span>  Mr.  Wakefield's  return  was  legal,  and</span><span>  Mr.  Sharples'  return  illegal.  If  such</span><span>  notice  were  not  legal,  then  neither  Mr.</span><span>  Wakefield  nor  Mr.  Sharples  are  legally</span><span>  elected.  The  wording  of  the  clause  Of</span><span>  the  Act  is  plain,  in  that  it</span><span>  markedly  points  out  that  no  person  shall</span><span>  become  a  candidate  at  an  election  for</span></p> <p><span>  which  he  has  acted  as  Returning  Officer  ;</span><span>  clearly  pointing  out  that  no  man  having</span></p> <p><span>  received  the  nominations  of  other  can-</span><span>  didates,  shall  himself  become  a  candidate.</span><span>  Now,  Did  Mr.  Sharples  do  this,  or  did</span><span>  he  not?  The  advertisement  in  reference</span><span>  to  the  election  says  that--""  Nominations</span><span>  close  at  4  p.m.  on  the  24th  instant,  and</span><span>  the  Returning  Officer  will  be  in  atten-</span><span>  dance  from  3  to  4  p.m.  of  that  day  to</span><span>  receive  them.  They  may,  however,  be</span><span>  handed  lo  him  at  any  time  previously</span><span>  with  a  deposit  of  ,£$  in  nomination  of</span><span>  aldermen.""  Here  it  is  prominently</span><span>  shown  that  Mr.  Sharples  could  have  had</span><span>  the  handling  of  the  nominations  of  other</span><span>  candidates,  in  direct  contravention  of</span><span>  the  Act,  since  his  name  appeared</span><span>  as  the  Returning  Officer  at  the</span><span>  foot  of  the  advertisement  notifying</span><span>  when  nominations  must  bc  in  his  hands  ;</span><span>  while  he  himself  became  a  candidate</span><span>  afterwards.  It  has  been  said  we  must</span><span>  look  to  the  spirit,  and  not  to  the  letter  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  statute.  We  are  quite  willing  to  do  '</span><span>  so,  and  hold  that  in  spirit  the  act  con-</span><span>  templated  the  prevention  of  the  very</span><span>  questionable  proceeding  of  which  Alder-</span><span>  man  Sharples  has  been  guilty-that  is,</span><span>  for  a  person  to  go  on  acting  as  Returning</span><span>  Officer  till  the  last  moment,  perhaps</span><span>  dealing  with  the  nominations  of  others,</span><span>  and  then  himself  becoming  a  candidate.</span><span>  What  is  the  meaning  of  thc  phrase  s.hr//</span><span>  heroine,  if  it  be  not  prohibitory  of  such  a</span><span>  proceeding.  The  Act  provides  that  the</span><span>  Chairman  of  a  municipality  shall  bc  the</span><span>  returning  officer  al  an  election,  unless  he</span><span>  is  ""incapable  of  acting.""  Now,  at  the</span><span>  time  he  signed  the  official  notification</span><span>  of  the  election.  Alderman  Sharples</span><span>  was  not  incapable,  but  having  assumed</span></p> <p><span>  the  position  of  returning  officer</span><span>  he  was  prevented  from  becoming  a</span><span>  candidate.  By  bis  own  act  he  disquali-</span><span>  fied  himself,  and  the  actual  Returning</span><span>  Officer  in  receiving  his  nomination,  made</span><span>  a  mistake.  Taking  this  view  of  Ihe</span><span>  matter,  the  proceedings  were  in  order</span><span>  and  legal  as  far  as  Mr.  Sharples'  nomina-</span><span>  tion,  but  they  were  stultified  by  what  took</span><span>  place  afterwards.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Town  Clerk  has  power  to  appoint</span><span>  a  returning  officer,^^d,  when  the  alder-</span><span>  man  appointed  by^HEouncil  ""became</span><span>  incapable  or  refusea^o  act,""  he  was</span><span>  justified  in  appointing  Alderman</span><span>  Williamson.  But  the  latter  gentleman</span><span>  issued  no  notice  of  the  election,  and</span><span>  that  issued  by  Alderman  Sharples  was</span><span>  mullitied  by  his  subsequent  action.</span></p> <p><span>  With  reference  to  the  cancelling  of</span><span>  Mr.  Wakefield's  contract-very  possibly</span><span>  Mr.  Wakefield  can  cancel  his  contract</span><span>  and  take  the  legal  responsibility-but</span><span>  the  question  is  not,  can  Mr.  Wakefield</span><span>  do  this  and  incur  an  action  at  law,  but  it  is,</span><span>  can  he  thus  constitute  his  own  legality  as  a</span><span>  candidate  for  election.  The  Mayor  and</span><span>  Mr.  Wakefield  may  have  decided  to</span><span>  transfer  the  contract,  and  thus  relieve</span><span>  Mr.  Wakefield  of  his  contract  under  the</span><span>  Council,  but  to  our  mind  a  duly  convened</span><span>  meeting  of  the  Aldermen  should  decide</span><span>  such  ancellation,  and  not  the  Mayor</span></p> <p><span>  j  and  contractor.  How  can  the  Council</span></p> <p><span>  confirm  the  Mayor's  action,  seeing  that  j</span><span>  Mr.  Wakefield  will  then  be  sitting,  and</span><span>  voting  on  the  acceptation  of  his  resigna-</span><span>  tion  as  a  contractor  with  the  municipality.</span><span>  I  Besides,  if  Mr.  Wakefield  by  his  own</span></p> <p><span>  I  action  could  rid  himself  of  his  contract,</span></p> <p><span>  there  was  no  need  for  him  to  consult  the</span><span>  Mayor  at  all  ;  nor  is  it  necessary  to  get</span><span>  the  consent  of  the  Council  to  the  action</span><span>  of  the  latter.  We  are  quite  aware  that</span><span>  by  section  38,  a  defective  election  shall</span><span>  not  invalidate  proceedings  of  the  Coun-</span><span>  cil  ;  but  that  does  not  relieve  the  person</span><span>  elected  of  responsibility  of  sitting  and</span><span>  voting  without  being  competently</span><span>  elected.  He  may  be  called  upon  to</span><span>  show  cause  under  clause  46  ""  why  he</span><span>  should  not  be  ousted  of  the  office.""  As</span><span>  we  contend  there  was  no  legal  in-</span><span>  timation  given  of  the  late  election,  all</span><span>  the  gentlemen  returned  may  be  called</span><span>  upon,  under  a  rule  of  the  Supreme</span><span>  Court,  to  defend  their  seats.  Then</span><span>  again  under  clause  116  if  the  Chairman</span><span>  if  a  Municipality,  or  Returning  Officer,</span><span>  having  undertaken  so  to  act,  shall  be</span><span>  guilty  of  any  negligent  act  of  commission</span><span>  or  omission  contrary  to  any  of  the  pro-</span><span>  visions  of  the  part  of  the  Act  referring</span><span>  to  elections,  he  shall  he  liable  to  a</span><span>  penally  not  exceeding  fifty  pounds.</span><span>  Now  it  is  a  moot  poinl  whether  both</span><span>  Alderman  Sharples  and  Williamson  have</span><span>  not  been  guilty  of  negligence-the</span><span>  former  in  acting  for  a  time  as  Returning</span><span>  Officer,  and  then  becoming  a  candidate  ;</span><span>  and  the  latter  in  receiving  Alderman</span><span>  Sharples'  nomination,-or,  indeed,  any</span><span>  of  the  nominations,  without  having  issued</span><span>  notice  of  the  election.</span></p> <p><span>  Upon  considering  the  numerous  ques-</span><span>  tions  raised,  we  think  our  readers  will</span><span>  share  our  opinion  that  there  has  been</span><span>  culpable  carelessness  in  connection  with</span><span>  >U~  I-fT  »Wlinn  Of  co»«  it  may  SUÍt</span><span>  the  book  of  interested  persons  to  say</span><span>  ""What  is  the  use  of  raising  a  row;</span><span>  whether  the  councillors  be  properly</span><span>  elected  or  not  will  not  invalidate  the  pro-</span><span>  ceedings  of  the  Council.""  That  is  quite</span><span>  true,  and  we  have  no  objections  to</span><span>  the  gentlemen  supposed  to  be</span><span>  elected  ;  but  in  matters  of  this  kind,</span><span>  we  hold  it  to  be  of  the  utmost  importance</span><span>  the  law  should  be  strictly  adhered  to.</span><span>  No  gentleman,  who,  so  far  as  he  is</span><span>  personally  concerned,  has  acted  fairly</span><span>  and  honestly,  in  order  to  secure  the</span><span>  honour  of  a  seat  io  the  Council,  should</span><span>  be  exposed  to  an  action  of  ""  Ouster  of</span><span>  Office,""  through  the  carelessness  of  any</span><span>  official.  Besides,  it  will  be  open  to  an</span><span>  elector  al  any  time  to  raise  such  an</span><span>  action,  and  cause  councillors  consider-</span><span>  able  trouble  and  expense.  People  may</span><span>  scout  the  idea  of  such  a  thing,  but</span><span>  gentlemen  who  give  their  time  and</span><span>  services  freely  to  the  performance  of</span><span>  public  duties,  should  be  protected  from</span><span>  the  possibility  of  annoyance.  We  have</span><span>  no  guarantee  that  this  will  be  the  case,  if</span><span>  the  Local  Government  Act,  is  not  under-</span><span>  stood  and  acted  on.  It  is  not  in  any</span><span>  spirit  of  fault  finding,  but  to  secure</span><span>  purity  of  election,  that  we  have  referred</span><span>  to  the  irregularities  noticed.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  Brisbane  Hospital  bas  lately  attracted</span><span>  oonsiderable  attention,  and  tho  Committee  of</span><span>  Management  have  decided  to  put  the  institu-</span><span>  tion  on  a  proper  footing.  Being  mostly  men,</span><span>  seemingly,  with  exalted  ideas  of  their  own</span><span>  wisdom,  the  metropolitan  faculty  have  hit</span><span>  upon  the  idea  that  if  the  visiting  staff  of</span><span>  surgeons  be  placed  in  authority  over  the</span><span>  resident  surgeon,  matters  will  go  along</span><span>  smoothly.  Thia  system  was  tried  in  the  Mel-</span><span>  bourne  Hospital,  and  increased  the  death-rate</span><span>  there  beyond  the  expectations  of  even  thc</span><span>  most  sanguine  undertaker.  Now  the  Brisbane</span><span>  hospital  is  about  two  miles  out  of  the  town,</span><span>  and  wc  will  suppose  that  a  serious  case  nf  accident</span><span>  arrives.  Thc  resident  surgeons  either  soothe</span><span>  thc  patient  down,  scrape  a  little  of  thc  mud  off</span><span>  him  if  he  has  been  run  over,  or  else  let  him</span><span>  lie,  and  messengers  are  sent  off  to  rally  tho</span><span>  honorary  medical  stall.  While  these  gentle-</span><span>  men,  who,  it  may  bc,  are  attending  their</span><span>  private  practice,  arc  being  collected  from</span><span>  all  points  of  the  compase,  the  patient</span><span>  suffers  untold  agony,  or  possibly  gives  (lp  the</span><span>  ghost  altogether.  If,  say,  a  typhoid  case</span><span>  comes  in-well,  it  is  necessary  that  the  physi-</span><span>  cian  should  see  the  patient  at  least  three</span><span>  times  during  the  first  twenty-four  hours.</span><span>  This  being  the  case,  it  is  pleasant  to  think  ol</span><span>  an  honorary  physician  driving  two  miles  out</span><span>  ami  back  from  his  private  residenoe,  during</span><span>  a  day.  Our  local  hospital  is  in  such  a  first</span><span>  class  and  satibfactnry  condition,  that  we  eau</span><span>  quite  alford  to  grow  funny  over  the  Brisbane</span><span>  one,  and  offer  a  little  fatherly  advice.  From</span><span>  a  selfish  point  of  view,  the  lVeas  might  be</span><span>  prompted  to  advocate  Hie  system  of  placing</span><span>  resident  hospital  surgeons  under  tho  control  of</span><span>  the  honorary  physicians,  because  there</span><span>  would  be  BO  much  squabbling  in  the</span><span>  hospitals,  and  so  innny  fatal  tormina,</span><span>  ti'im  ti  accident  cases.  This,  it  will  be</span><span>  seen,  would  furnish  many  sensational</span><span>  paragraphs,  but  it  is  our  pride  to  rise  above</span><span>  pcrsuunl  considerations.  Thus  even  thc  pros</span><span>  pects  of  thu  eurgoonfl  nuarrulliug  with  each</span></p> <p><span>  utlwr  daily,  and  frightfully  inlurustiii;;  deaths</span><span>  occurring  frequently,  do  not  CIUIHO  US  Iq</span><span>  advocate  placing  tho  resilient  medical  staff</span><span>  under  the  visiting  surgeons.  The  Brisbane</span><span>  hospital  committee  advise  a  trial  of  tho  prac-</span><span>  tice,  and  so  doubt  before  hag  interesting</span><span>  remits  may  come  under  notice,</span></p> <p><span>  ExraAORDiKaRv.  though  (he  statement</span><span>  ?eenie  to  soma,  it-«ornes  to  na  {rom  the</span><span>  Superintendent  Of  the  Immigration  Dépôt,</span><span>  and  therefore  should  be  thoroughly  reliable.</span><span>  It  is  this  :  That  the  rate  of  «ragea  offered  to</span><span>  Immigrants  has  risen  considerably  since  the</span><span>  introduction  of  Kanaka  labour.  There  is</span><span>  hardly  any  necessity  to  remark  much  upon</span><span>  this,  the  {act  is  unmistakeable,  and  should</span><span>  silence  those  ?  thickatidthin  opponents  of</span><span>  coloured  labour.  Looking  at  the  question  cf</span><span>  employing  Coolies  on  the  sugar  plantations,  it</span><span>  «rill  be  seen  that  so  long  as  these  men  are</span><span>  employed  in  only  such  work  as  white  men</span><span>  won't  undertake,  they  must  have  tho  effect  of</span><span>  increasing  the  demand  for  white  labour,  lt</span><span>  must  bc  remembered  that,  say  for  picking</span><span>  coffee,  white  men  are  unavailable  ;  the  work</span><span>  could  not  possibily  be  sufficiently  remunera-</span><span>  tive  to  pay  them,  and  yet  leave  the  planter  a</span><span>  fair  profit.  The  same  with  sugar-it  simply</span><span>  would  not  pay  ta  employ  whito  men  among  tho</span><span>  canes,  and  we  have  too  much  respect  for  the</span><span>  Bristish  workman  to  ever  hope  that  he  would</span><span>  work  far  thc  paltry  wages,  which  can  alone  be</span><span>  offered  for  this  class  of  employment.  But  let</span><span>  us  suppose  that  cheap  black  labour  is  em-</span><span>  ployed  where  white  is  unavailable,  suppose</span><span>  that  thuB  sugar  and  coffee  plantations  prosper,</span></p> <p><span>  this  must  necessarily  increase  the  demand  for.</span><span>  machinery  and  appliances,  in  the  construction</span><span>  of  which  white  mechanics  are  employed.  It</span><span>  is  au  unmistakeable  fact  that  with  tho  growth</span><span>  of  the  sugar  industry  the  iron  trades  have  im-</span></p> <p><span>  proved,  and  undoubtedly  the  building  trade  j</span></p> <p><span>  would  also  increase.  When  Kanakas  were</span><span>  first  introduced  there  waa  the  usual  cry  out</span><span>  against  black  labour,  but  the  effect  of  it  has</span><span>  boen  to  raise  white  men's  wages.  When  Mr.</span><span>  Brookes  defied  any  one  to  point  him  to  a  pros-</span><span>  perous  country  where  black  labour  was</span><span>  employed,  he  forgot  lodia,  and  possibly  forgot</span><span>  this  country  where  Kanakas  are  in  service.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Customs  collections  at  this  port  from</span><span>  the  22ad  to  the  27th  iastsut  iaolusive,</span><span>  amounted  to  f1026  Us.  ii.</span></p> <p><span>  SOBS  nice  specimens  of  the  rose-apple  were</span><span>  brought  to  our  office  on  Saturday  by  Ur.</span><span>  Goebel,  '  Silverhill,  Mount  Hedlow  '  Road.</span><span>  They  had  the  odour  of  roses,  and  a  pleasant</span><span>  taste.

A</span><span>  programme  of  amusements  will  be  published</span><span>  to-morrow,  and  the  Committee  is  endeavouring</span></p> <p><span>  to  provide  rational  enjoyment  on  the  half</span><span>  holiday  for  thc  emancipated  employees.</span></p> <p><span>  A  Government  Gazette  Extraordinary  was</span><span>  issued  on  Wednesday  notifying  that  ""  Her</span><span>  Majesty  the  Queen  has  been  graciously  pleased</span><span>  to  appoint  the  Honourable  Thomas  M'IL</span><span>  wraith  to  be  an  ordinary  member  of  the</span><span>  second-class,  or  a  Knight  Commander,  o!  the</span><span>  most  distinguished  Order  of  St.  Michael  and</span><span>  St.  George.</span></p> <p><span>  NOTWITHSTANDING  all  that  has  been  said</span><span>  and  written  about  the  danger  of  allowing</span><span>  goats  and  cattle  to  wander  about  tho  roads  ia</span><span>  the  municipality,  no  remedy  for  it  has  yet</span><span>  been  put  in  force.  The  Inspector  of  Nuisances</span><span>  seems  to  be  comparatively  powerless  to</span><span>  prevent  it.  A  case  has  occurred  that  we  hope</span><span>  will  be  the  meanB  of  stirring  np.  our  muni-</span><span>  cipal  authorities  to  a  sense  of  their  responsi-</span><span>  bility  in  this  matter.  At  an  early  hour</span><span>  yesterday  morning,  a  gentleman  residing  on</span><span>  tho  Range  was  unexpectedly  called  upon  to  go</span><span>  for  a  doctor  and  a  norse.  In  returning  with</span><span>  the  latter,  and  driving  smartly  of  course,  the</span><span>  horse  and  buggy  come  upon  a  oow  slumbering</span><span>  on  tbe  road.'  There  was  a  sharp  collision,  the</span><span>  result  of.  which  was  the  occupants  of  the</span><span>  vehicle  were  thrown  out,  and  one  of  them</span><span>  severely  injured.  In  this  case  we  hope  an</span><span>  action  will  be  raised  against  the  members  of</span><span>  the  Council,  as  there  can  be  no  doubt  they,  by</span><span>  their  negligence,  contributed  to  the  accident.</span></p> <p><span>  SEVERAL  antidotes  have  been  proposed  for</span><span>  the  conversion  of  our  young  men  from  a  too</span><span>  fond  attachment  to  fire-water.  Matrimony</span><span>  has  been  suggested  but  the  sinners  have</span><span>  replied-""  there  is  none  here  to  marry.""  This</span><span>  difficulty  appears  to  be  the  other  way  round</span><span>  in  the  northern  districts,  for  the  following</span><span>  plaintive  appeal  is  from  one  of  our  exchanges:</span><span>  -""Matrimony.-A  young  lady,  age20,  wishes</span><span>  to  correspond  with  a  gentlemen  able  to  keop  a</span><span>  wife  comfortably,  not  over  30.  Please  enclose</span><span>  photos.  Address-""A.B.""  Post  Office,  Towns-</span><span>  ville.""  This  is  of  course  a  gratuitous  advertise-</span><span>  ment,  but  there  being  a  lady  in  the  caso-well,</span><span>  even  newspapermen  nave  somefeeling.  There  is</span><span>  something  vague  about  the  advertisement,</span><span>  however,  for  though  the  lady's  age  is  stated  at</span><span>  twenty,  it  is  questionable  whether  she  does  not</span><span>  require  a  young  man  able  to  keep  a  wife  over</span><span>  thirty.  Mow,  there  is  a  difference  of  having</span><span>  to  keep  a  wife  of  twenty  years  and  one  of</span><span>  thirty.  Up  to  about  twenty-five  ""love  in  a</span><span>  cottage  ""  sort  of  existence  will  suit  the  lady  ;</span><span>  but  at  about  thirty  some  solid  comforts  are</span><span>  demanded,  and  the  appetite  loses  its  sylph-lik*</span><span>  and  poetical  smallness.</span></p> <p><span>  WHEN  Mr.  Brookes  referred  to  the  treat-</span><span>  ment  immigrants  receive  in  Rockhampton,</span><span>  there  was  no  doubt  much  good  ground  for</span><span>  his  complaint.  It  appears,  however,  that  ns</span><span>  far  as  providing  suitable  food  for  theBe  persons</span><span>  there  is  some  difficulty  to  be  overcome  by  the</span><span>  Superintendent  of  the  depot.  He  is  not  made</span><span>  aware  of  the  precise  time  when  the  new-</span><span>  comers  may  be  expected,  whian,  of  course,</span><span>  inconveniences  bim  greatly.  This  matter</span><span>  should  be  attended  to,  if  there  is  to  be  any</span><span>  comfort  ensured  on  arrival  at  Rookhampton.</span><span>  Undoubtedly  it  is  very  necessary  that  during</span><span>  the  first  evening  after  landing  tho  greatest</span><span>  care  should  be  taken  to  protect  the  immi-</span><span>  grants  from  the  danger  of  falling  into  the</span><span>  hands  of  unscrupulous  persona.  Hence  the</span><span>  rule  of  looking  the  Immigration  .Depot,  and</span><span>  preventing  the  egress  of  the  arrivals,  or  ingress</span><span>  of  an  indiscriminate  mob,  is  very  proper.</span><span>  When  this  is  done,  of  course  no  opportunity</span><span>  is  afforded  such  immigrants  as  have  money  of</span><span>  purchasing  such  luxuries  as  fruit  and  vege-</span><span>  tables,  which  they  would  relish  after  a  long</span><span>  sea  voyage.  There  being  nothing  to  prevent</span><span>  vendors  of  these  articles  from  selling  them</span><span>  through  the  Depot  gate,  it  may  be  expected</span><span>  that  some  enterprising  fruiterers  will,  on</span><span>  occasion,  attend.  If  they  do  so,  the  new-</span><span>  comers  will  appreciate  the  attention,  and  the</span><span>  tradesman,  no  doubt,  be  well  paid.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  limited  attendance  in  the  front  eeats  of</span><span>  the  Theatre  Royal  on  Saturday  evening  last</span><span>  most  have  convinced  the  manager  of  the</span><span>  Mastodon  Star  Minstrels  that  tho  character  of</span><span>  the  entertainment  on  Friday  evening  did  not</span><span>  quite  suit  the  taste  of  Rockhampton  audiences.</span><span>  AB  there  will  be  a  variety  of  performances  in</span><span>  future,  and  the  errors  of  the  opening  night</span><span>  may  be  avoided,  we  have  no  doubt  the  com-</span><span>  pany  «ill  draw  good  houses.  The  negro</span><span>  minstrel  entertainments  have  lost  the  attrac-</span><span>  tion  which  their  novelty  gave  them  for  a  time,</span><span>  but  they  are  still  relished  as  an  alterative  in</span><span>  amusements.  Seldom  is  it  the  case,</span><span>  as  in  the  Mastodon  troupe,  that  veri-</span><span>  table  negroes  are  among  tho  performers,</span><span>  and  this  fact  will  interest  many.

The</span><span>  trip  up  tho  river  was  a  remarkably  pleasant</span><span>  one,  and  all  the  good  things  that  had</span><span>  been  kindly  provided  for  the  excursionists</span><span>  were  thoroughly  appreciated.  Too  much  can</span><span>  hardly  be  said  of  the  kindness  of  Oaptain</span><span>  Hunter  in  the  matter;  who  has  shown  a  great</span><span>  amount  of  interest  in  the  little  unfortunates,</span><span>  several  times  visiting  them  during  their  stay</span><span>  on  the  island,  and  exerting  himself  to  Ret</span><span>  donations  of  eatables  for  their  pleasure.

W.  HOWARD  SMITH  AND  SON'S</span><span>  new  steamer  Moreton  berthed  at  Hie  Corpora-</span><span>  tion  wharf  yesterday  afternoon.  She  left</span><span>  Sydney  on  Sunday  morning,  the  21st  instant,</span><span>  and  arrived  at  Wewoastle  at  5  p.m.  Here  a</span><span>  oargo  of  coal  was  shipped  for  the  Railway</span><span>  Department.  She  continued  her  -  voyage  at</span><span>  3  a.  ui.  on  23rd,  and  anchored  in  the  Fitzroy</span></p> <p><span>  River  on  Saturday  to  await  tho  tide.  She'</span><span>  arrived  here  at  2  p.m.  A  southerly  wind  with</span><span>  high  sea  prevailed  to  tho  Seal  Rocks  ;  thence</span><span>  to  Cape  Moreton  fresh  head  winds  ;  and  from</span><span>  the  Cape  to  Keppel  Bay  thick  blinding  rain</span><span>  with  heavy  thunder  squalls  were  encountered.</span><span>  In  this  rough  -  weather  the  ship  behaved</span><span>  admirably,  and  displayed  good  sea-going</span><span>  qualities.  The  Moreton  ia  built  somewhat</span><span>  after  the  style  of  th»  Keilawarra,  but,  there  is</span><span>  more  space  on  deck'  aft.  She  was  visited  by</span><span>  a  large  number  of  persons  yesterday  who</span><span>  inspeoted  her  from  stem  to  stern  with  much</span><span>  interest.  We  append  a  description  of  the</span><span>  steamer  whioh  is  a  noteworthy  addition  to  the</span><span>  steam  fleet  of  this  port,  anil  should  prove  very</span></p> <p><span>  serviceable  and  suitable  for  the  trade  between</span><span>  N.  8,  Wales  and  the  Queensland  ports.  The</span><span>  Moreton  was  launched  in  the  beginning.ol</span><span>  August  last  from  the  yard  of  Messrs.  W,</span><span>  Walker  and  Co.,  of  Deptford,  and  is  a'  very</span><span>  smart-looking  vessel.  The  best  steel  is  used</span><span>  in  the  construction  of  the  hull,  the  dimensions</span><span>  of  which  are  as  follow  :-181  feet  long,  27  feet</span><span>  broad,  depth  of  hold  10  feet  10  inches.  This</span><span>  gives  a  register  of  355  tons,  with  a  carrying</span><span>  capacity  of  over  700  tons.  Her  engines  were</span><span>  made  by  Bolton  and  Watts,  of  Deptford,  and</span><span>  are  on  the  compound  principle,  with  all</span><span>  modern  improvements.  They  are  of  70  horse-</span><span>  power  nominal,  and  aro  expected  to  drive  the</span><span>  ship  along  at  a  rate  of  over  10  knots.  During</span><span>  tho  voyage  from  Glasgow  the  Moreton  came</span><span>  along  under  easy  steam,  so  that  no  actual  test</span><span>  of  her  steaming  powers  has  yet  been  hod,</span><span>  though  the  record  of  one  day's  work  showed</span><span>  that  she  had  covered  230  miles.  She  is  pro-</span><span>  vided  with  four  steam  winches  for  the  out-put</span><span>  and  taking  in  of  cargo,  and  steam  is  alBo</span><span>  utilised  in  steering  the  vessel  and  for  supply-</span><span>  ing  the  means  of  ventilation  to  the  saloon  and</span><span>  second  cabin.  Tho  latter  improvement  is  a</span><span>  novelty,  indeed-the  Moreton  is  the  first</span><span>  vessel  that  has  been  supplied  with  the  patent</span><span>  apparatus  driven  by  steam  for  ensuring  the</span><span>  thorough  ventilation  of  the  berths.  Con-</span><span>  sidering  the  size  of  the  Moreton  ber  saloon  is</span><span>  roomy.  It  measures  40  feet  by  24  feet,  and  is</span><span>  very  chastely  fitted  up,  and  painted,  light</span><span>  green  and  gold  nicely  relieving  a  white</span><span>  ground,  and  walnut  panels  highly  polished</span><span>  setting  off  the  whole.  Ample  provision  is</span><span>  made  for  ventilation,  as,  in  addition  to  the</span><span>  apparatus  referred  to  the  face  of  the  berths  is</span><span>  made  of  jalousies,  and  there  are  openings  over</span><span>  the  tops  of  the  doors  to  allow  of  the  ingress</span><span>  and  egress  of  air.  There  is  accommodation  in</span><span>  the  saloon  for  twenty-four  passengers,  who</span><span>  will  find  themselves  very  comfortably  provided</span><span>  for,  many  of  the  details  in  the  ship  being  an</span><span>  improvement  on  the  accommodation  usually</span><span>  provided  in  intercolonial  vessels.  The  second</span><span>  cabin  is  also  a  comfortable  apartment,  and  bas</span><span>  room  for  twenty-four  passengers.  The  officers'</span><span>  and  engineers'  quarters  are  amidships,  and</span></p> <p><span>  the  crew  are  accommodated  forward.  The</span><span>  Moreton  has  a  splendid  deck  for  promenading</span><span>  upon,  and,  covered  with  awnings,  it  will  bo</span><span>  anattractivospot  for  passengers  on  awarm  day.</span><span>  She  is  commanded  by  Captain  George  Andrews,</span><span>  late  mate  of  the  Keilawarra,  who  has  received</span><span>  woll-carned  promotion  in  the  service.

"<p><span>  Oíhf^vninjif  iilletiit,</span></p> <p><span>  KOCKll.ÚU'TON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY.  MARCH  2,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  SOME  of  our  readers  may  have  been</span><span>  deterred  by  its  length  from  reading  the</span><span>  reports:which  we  gave  of  the  annual</span><span>  meeting  of  the  Central  Queensland</span><span>  Meat  Export  Company  ;  and  of  the</span><span>  visit  paid  to  the  Fitzroy  Works  at  Lake's</span><span>  Creek  by  the  directors,  shareholders,</span><span>  and  others.  We  hope,  however,  they  will</span><span>  be  carefully  perused  by  every  one  in-</span><span>  terested  in  the  prosperity  of  the  Central</span><span>  District.  It  only  requires  a  little</span><span>  thought  and  consideration  to  see  clearly</span><span>  how  closely  the  meat  trade,  as  the</span><span>  directors  propose  to  develop  it,  is  asso-</span><span>  ciated  with  the  progress  of  this  portion</span><span>  of  the  colony.  The  fact  is  eyer  staring</span><span>  us  in  the  face  that  the  pastoral  industry</span><span>  is  now,  and  for  many  years  to  come</span><span>  will  continue  to  be,  the  mainstay  for  tile,</span><span>  employment  of  capital  and  labour  in  our</span><span>  midst.  To  the  west  of  Rockhampton  is</span><span>  a  wide  .area  of  country,  which  has  within</span><span>  the  last  few  years  been  opened  up  by</span><span>  the  Central  Railway.  As  it  is  being</span><span>  pushed  out  westwards  it  is  tapping  still</span><span>  wider  areas.  At  present  we  have  not</span><span>  fully  realised  the  stock-bearing  capabili-</span><span>  ties  of  this  country.  Even  in  the  Settled</span><span>  Districts  our  experience  of  the  results  of</span><span>  fencing  and  water  conservation  has  been</span><span>  been  limited,  and  has  not  been  of  such</span><span>  a  character  as  to  furnish  accurate  data</span><span>  for  calculations  as  to  the  future.  Ac-</span><span>  cording  to  our  latest  returns  the  number</span><span>  of  cattle  in  the  Central  District  was</span><span>  1,037,236,  and  of  sheep,  3,245,292.</span><span>  Within  the  last  year  the  effect  of  the</span><span>  operations  of  the  Company  has  been  to</span><span>  raise  the  average  price  of  cattle  twenty</span><span>  shillingsa  head.  Thatuponthctotalwould</span><span>  mean  an  increase  of  capital-an  acces-</span><span>  sion  of  purchasing  power  to  the  squatters,</span><span>  of  a  million  of  pounds  sterling.  They</span><span>  would  have  that  much  more  serurity  to</span><span>  offer  for  cash  needed  in  increasing  their</span><span>  herds  and  improving  their  stations.</span><span>  Owing  to  thc  restricted  range  of  the</span><span>  company's  operations  it  has  not  done</span><span>  this  ;  but  a  little  reflection  on  these  facts</span><span>  and  figures  will  enable  our  readers  to</span><span>  realise  the  mighty  influence  it  may  come</span><span>  to  exert  on  our  pastoral  industry.  In</span><span>  Rockhampton  district  alone  there  were</span><span>  in  i88r,  193,778  caltle.  Now  an  in-</span><span>  crease  of  one  pound  sterling  a  head  on</span><span>  one  fourth  of  that  number  is  equal  to</span><span>  nearly  ,£50,000  or  the  entire  capital  of</span><span>  the  Company.  Very  lillie  foresight  is</span><span>  needed,  we  think,  to  see  that,  if  the</span><span>  Company  is  to  be  instrumental  in  main</span></p> <p><span>  taining  this  increase  io  value,  not  only</span><span>  must  the  capital  solicited  by  the  Direc-</span><span>  tors  be  subscribed,  at  once,  but  provision</span><span>  must  be  made  for  the  expansion  of</span><span>  operations.  The  Directors  have  booked</span><span>  already  as  many  callie  as  will  keep  the</span><span>  works  fully  employed  till  November</span><span>  next.  The  number  is  13,000  head,  and  it</span><span>  must  be  apparent  that  quantity  can</span><span>  represent  only  a  small  portion  of  the</span><span>  the  surplus  stock  of  the  district.  These</span><span>  figures  refer  to  cattle  alone,  but  as  our</span><span>  Central  Railway  penetrates  the  sheep</span><span>  country,  the  squatters  will  look  to</span><span>  this  port  to  provide  them  with</span><span>  facilities  for  exporting  mutton  as</span><span>  well  as  beef.  Indeed,  Mr.  William</span><span>  Pattison,  in  the  course  of  his  remarks  at</span><span>  the  works  on  Wednesday  afternoon',</span><span>  hinted  at  the  desirability  of  this  being</span><span>  done.  In  their  immediate  interests  it</span><span>  seems  clear  the  squatters  should  not</span><span>  restrain  the  energy  of  the  Meat  Export</span><span>  Company  by  withholding  the  capital</span><span>  required  for  it.  When  it  is  remembered</span><span>  that  the  price  of  cattle  in  future  -  will  be</span><span>  ruled  by  the  capabilities  of  the  company,</span><span>  every  man  who  owns  a  hundred  head</span><span>  should  take  shares  in  the  undertaking.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  mercantile  and  manufacturing  j</span><span>  interests  are  so  closely  associated  with</span><span>  in  fact,  are  so  dependent  on  the  pastoral,</span><span>  that  anything  which  effects  the  latter  tells</span><span>  on  the  former.  A  severe  drought  spread'</span><span>  dulness  in  the  town  as  well  as  in  the</span><span>  country.  It  may  be  true,  as  Mr.  Liver-</span><span>  more  says,  that  the  Company  is  a</span><span>  squatting  concern,  but  it  is  something</span><span>  more.  ,  It  is  an  important  factor,  in  the</span><span>  promotion  of  the  general  interests  of  the</span><span>  colony,  and  as  such  should  receive  the</span><span>  support  of  all  classes  of  the  community.</span></p> <p><span>  .With  considerable  satisfaction  it  will</span><span>  be  observed,  that,  in  laying  down  the</span><span>  lines  of  future  action,  the  Directors  of</span><span>  the  Company  are  more  intent  upon</span><span>  prosecuting  the  freezing  than  the  meat</span><span>  preserving  department  of  their  business.</span><span>  This  shows  prudence  on  their  part,</span></p> <p><span>  and  a  comprehension  of  the  proba-'</span><span>  bilities  of  the  future  which  .  should</span><span>  commend  their  wisdom  and  judgment  tb</span><span>  the  shareholders.  The  success  of  the</span><span>  Fitzroy  works  has  been  due  to  the  cheap</span><span>  price  at  which  beef  could  be  obtained,</span><span>  and  the  admirable  manner  in  which  it</span><span>  has  been  preserved.  Competitors  are</span><span>  starting  up,  however,  and  among  recently</span><span>  prospected  companies  is  ""  The  Austra-</span><span>  lian  Fresh  Meat  Company""  with  a</span><span>  capital  of  ¿£200,000.  -  The  promoters;</span><span>  of  this,  or  some  other  company,  proposed</span><span>  to  expend  their  funds  in  Melbourne,</span><span>  as,it  was  remarked,  theclimateof  Queens-</span><span>  land  increased  the  difficulties  of  meat</span><span>  preserving.  Because  at  Lake's  Creek</span><span>  these  difficulties  have  been  overcome  by</span><span>  Mr.  Bertram,  it  does  not  follow  that  the</span><span>  absence  of  them  would  not  facilitate  and</span><span>  cheapen  the  cost  of  meat  preserving  in</span><span>  Melbourne.  Then,  again,  labour  there</span><span>  is  much  cheaper  than  in  Queensland.</span><span>  At  present  the  Company  can  tempt  tin-</span><span>  smiths  hither  from  the  Victorian  capital.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  cheap  beef  is  a  set  off  against  dear'</span><span>  labour  ;  in  Melbourne  labour  is  cheap</span></p> <p><span>  but  beef  dear.  If  an  intercolonial  frozen</span><span>  meat  trade  spring  up,  and  the  Melbourne</span><span>  makers  can  purchase  Queensland  car-</span><span>  casses  at  a  slight  advance  on  the</span><span>  price  paid  in  this  colony,  then,  with</span><span>  their  cheap  labour,  they  may  be</span><span>  able  to  undersell  Fitzroy  Works  pre-</span><span>  served  meat  in  the  markets  of  Europe.</span><span>  That  is  an  easily  comprehensible  con-</span><span>  tingency.  It  is  also  within  the  range  of</span><span>  possibility  that  an  Australian  preserved</span><span>  meat  business  may  be  created  in  the  old</span><span>  country.  We  can  imagine  a  time  when</span><span>  the  importation  of  frozen  meat  from</span><span>  South  America  and  Australasia  will  so</span><span>  reduce  prices  in  the  home  market  that</span><span>  meat  preserving  shall  become  aprofitable</span><span>  industry.  Unless  Queensland  had  then  a</span><span>  large  supply  of  cheap  labour,  meat  preser-</span><span>  ving  would  become  unprofitable.  Some</span><span>  may  ,  think  the  chances  of  such  a  state  of</span><span>  matters  Arising  are  too  remote  to  deserve</span><span>  considerations.  But,  the  transitions  in</span><span>  the  meat  export  trade  have  been  so</span><span>  sudden,  and  startling,  there  is  reason</span><span>  to  dread  any  eventuality,  within  the</span><span>  bounds  of  reasonable  comprehension.</span><span>  There  is  not  the  same  grounds,  how-</span><span>  ever,  to  dread  the  interruption  of  ihe</span><span>  frozen  meat  trade.  To  it  there  seems  to</span><span>  bc  no  limit,  save  the  refrigerating  capacity</span><span>  of  the  Tha'chihery  and  chambers  at  the</span><span>  works.  At  present  10,060  carcases  a  year</span><span>  could  be  chilled  for  exportation,  and</span><span>  without  much  expenditure  of  capital,  or</span><span>  addition  of  labourv  the  ""output""  could</span><span>  be  increased.  As  time  goes  on  the  cost</span><span>  of  freezing  and  carrying  meat  will  be</span><span>  reduced.  If  the  .invention  of  Mr.</span><span>  Joseph  James  Coleman,  of  Bell-Coleman</span><span>  fame,  succeeds,  the  facilities  for  trans-</span><span>  porting  dead  meat  from  our  western</span><span>  pastures  to  Keppel  Bay  will  be  greatly</span><span>  increased,  and  it  is  impossible  to  com-</span><span>  prehend  the  magnitude  to  which  it  may</span><span>  expand.  So  long  as  we  can  produce</span><span>  beef  and  mutton  cheaper  than  any  other</span><span>  country,  so  long  will  our  frozen  meat  trade</span><span>  be  a  large  and  flourishing  industry-and</span><span>  that  shall  be  a  very  long  lime  indeed.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  anticipation  of  tho  cricket  match  with</span><span>  Brisbane,  thc  Committee  appointed  to  select</span><span>  thc  Rockhampton  toain  havo  arranged  tu  have</span><span>  a  match  played  between  most  of  thc  loading</span><span>  cricketers  of  the  town,  preparatory  to  any</span><span>  selection  being  made  as  to  who  shall  bc  in</span><span>  bludcd  in  thc  Eleven  to  oppose  the  metropoli-</span><span>  tans.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  APRIL  9,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  all  the  Australian  colonies  it  is  a  fact,</span><span>  which  bitter  experience  seems  to  have</span><span>  placed  beyond  the  reach  of  controversy,</span><span>  that  agriculture  will  never  attain  to</span><span>  the  dimensions  required  of  it,  unless</span><span>  man  greatly  aids  Nature  in  producing</span></p> <p><span>  circumstances  under  which  it  is  at  all</span><span>  possible.  We  do  not  refer  to  the  clear-</span><span>  ing  of  the  land  from  dense  scrub-the</span><span>  growth  of  ages-or  the  breaking  up  and</span></p> <p><span>  reclamation  of  the  soil.  These  are  con-</span><span>  ditions  essential  to  successful  husbandry</span><span>  in  any  climate.  In  temperate  regions</span></p> <p><span>  circumstances  are  suitable  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  growth  of  cereal  crops.  In  general  the</span><span>  rainfall  is  ample  ;  the  soil  when  cleared</span><span>  is  suitable  ;  and  the  heat  and  sunshine</span><span>  are  sufficient  to  bring  the  plants</span><span>  to  maturity.  If  the  farmer  only</span><span>  performs  the  work  that  experience</span><span>  has  shown  to  be  necessary,  in  the</span><span>  ordinary  course  of  years  he  can  obtain</span><span>  a  fair  return  for  his  labour.  Farming  in</span><span>  Australia,  except  in  a  few  favourable</span><span>  localities,  sad  experience  has  demon-</span><span>  strated,  cannot  be  carried  on  with  so</span><span>  much  certainty  as  to  results.  The  chief</span><span>  reason  of  this  is  our  dry  climate,-our</span><span>  uncertain  rainfall.  Where  it  has  been</span><span>  attempted  to  prosecute  agricultural</span><span>  pursuits  under  purely  natural  circum-</span><span>  stances,  failure  has  taken  place.  It  is</span><span>  not  so  much  the  want  of  rain,  but  the</span><span>  absence  of  moisture  for  the  crops  at  a</span><span>  critical  stage  of  their  development,  which</span><span>  has  led  to  disappointment  and  loss.</span><span>  Thus  it  has  been  made  plain  that</span><span>  our  farmers  must  come  to  the  aid  of</span><span>  Nature,  in  a  manner,  and  to  an  extent,</span><span>  which  are  quite  unnecessary  in  tem-</span><span>  perate  regions.  Water  conservation,</span><span>  and  distribution,  or  irrigation,  must</span><span>  form,  in  theory  and  practice,  among</span><span>  the  greatest  concerns  of  Australian</span><span>  husbandmen.  They  have  learned  that,</span><span>  in  regard  to  these  malters1  they  must</span><span>  do  a  great  deal  of  work,  if  arable  agri-</span><span>  culture  is  to  become,  as  it  is  desirable</span><span>  it  should,  a  large  and  important  industry.</span><span>  This  ts  generally  admitted,  andnumerous</span><span>  questions  now  present  themselves  for</span><span>  discussion  and  settlement,  in  connection</span><span>  with  this  large  and  important  subject.</span><span>  Some  of  these  it  is  most  desirable  our</span><span>  farmers  and  selectors  should  carefully</span><span>  consider.  The  Government  have</span><span>  promised,  if  permitted,  to  pass  a  Water</span><span>  Conservation  Bill,  and  among  many</span><span>  topics,  which  the  electors  at  the  present</span><span>  time  should  turn  over  in  their  minds,</span><span>  this  ought  not  to  be  lost  sight  of.  A</span><span>  most  important  point  for  consideration</span><span>  is-how  far  the  collecting  and  distributing</span><span>  of  water  is  to  be  left  theprivateenterprise.</span><span>  It  will  appear  quiet  evident,  upon  a  little</span><span>  reflection,  that  if  every  large  landholder</span><span>  is  permitted  to  carry  on  works  in  his</span><span>  own  interest  solely,  disputes  and</span><span>  contentions  will  be  certain  to  arise.</span></p> <p><span>  Cases,  similar  to  these  of  which  wejpme</span><span>  times  read  in  the  home  papers  -pierop</span><span>  up,  and  in  proportion  as  the  interests</span></p> <p><span>  associated  with  them  here  will  be  much</span></p> <p><span>  greater,  so  will  be  the  obstacles  to  their</span><span>  satisfactory  settlement.  The-diversion</span><span>  of  a  water  course,  whereby  a  mill  may-</span><span>  be  stopped,  or  a  source  of  water  supply</span><span>  for  cattle  removed,  gives'  risè  to  costly</span><span>  law  suits  in  England.  Now,  if  we  look</span><span>  to  the  flat  character  of  the  greater  part</span><span>  of  this  colony,  to  the  scarcity  of</span></p> <p><span>  permanent  streams  of  water,  and  lo  the  j</span><span>  value  of  moisture  in  agriculture  it  will</span><span>  be  seen  that  individual  meddling  with</span><span>  what  is  public  property  must  be</span><span>  rigidly  supervised.  In  the  streams  of</span><span>  Europe,  where  surface  water  is  not  so</span><span>  valuable  as  in  this  colony,  the  proprietor</span><span>  of  the  lands  on  either  side  could  not</span><span>  erect  a  weir  or  dam  dyke,  to  the  pre-</span><span>  judice  of  his  neighbours  farther  down</span><span>  the  stream.  Should  it  be  thought  desir-</span><span>  able  lo  form  dykes  across  some  of</span><span>  our  flowing  streams,  for  the  purpose  of</span><span>  disseminating  water  over  a  wide  area  of</span><span>  level  land,  then  great  injury  may  be</span><span>  done  to  those  whose  lands  farther  down</span></p> <p><span>  depend  on  the  river  for  moisture.  There</span><span>  seems  a  likelihood,  if  private  irrigation</span><span>  works  and  the  damming  and  tapping</span><span>  of  our  running  streams  are  to  be</span><span>  allowed,  that  the  smaller  landholders</span><span>  may  be  placed  at  a  disadvantage.  We</span><span>  can  conceive  of  the  wealthy  holder</span><span>  of  a  large  estate,  situated  on</span><span>  the  tipper  channel  of  one  of</span><span>  our  rivers,  constructing  works  which</span><span>  would  catch  the  rainfall,  divert  the  water</span><span>  to  his  own  uses,  and  deprive  landowners</span></p> <p><span>  lower  down  the  stream  of  their  natural</span><span>  and  accustomed  supply  of  water.  Here</span><span>  there  would  be  a  clear  interference  with</span></p> <p><span>  the  rights  or  property.  Deprived  of  its</span><span>  natural  supply  of  moisture  the  land</span><span>  of  the  lower  proprietor  would  be  greatly</span><span>  depreciated  in  value.  One  caa  conceive,</span><span>  again,  of  a  capitalist  forming  a  large</span><span>  dam,  and  cutting  off  water  from  his</span><span>  neighbours,  and  tendering  dam-making</span><span>  on  their  part  altogether  useless.  It  is</span></p> <p><span>  the  more  desirable  that  attention  should</span></p> <p><span>  be  paid  to  this  subject  'now,  because</span><span>  there  are  large  areas  of  land  in  the</span><span>  hands  of  the  Government,  and  the  natural</span><span>  water-supplies  of  these  may  be  seriously</span><span>  injured  for  all  time  coming  by  the  works</span><span>  of  far-seeing,  skilled,  and  unscrupulous</span></p> <p><span>  conterminous  land-owners.  In  this  con-</span><span>  nection  we  may  be  permitted  to  point</span><span>  out  that,  not  only  the  collection  and  dis-</span><span>  tribution  of  surface  water,  but  the  dis-</span><span>  charge  of  the  surplus  must  be  attended</span><span>  to.  Proprietors,  for  their  own  sakes,  will</span></p> <p><span>  see  to  it  that  the  water  which  is  not</span></p> <p><span>  appropriated  by  the  soil  on  their  estates</span><span>  is  not  allowed  to  accumulate,  and  form</span><span>  improductive  swamps  or  sour  the  land.</span><span>  But  will  they  be  perfectly  careful  in  these</span><span>  matters  with  respect  to  their  neighbours'</span><span>  lands.  In  legislating  on  the  subject,  we</span><span>  are  afraid  it  will  be  well  to  provide  for</span></p> <p><span>  the  waste  waters  from  one  estate  not</span></p> <p><span>  being  allowed  to  run  off  and  accumu-</span><span>  late  on  another.  Indeed,  the  more</span><span>  the  Water  Question  is  looked  at,</span><span>  in  the  light  of  the  points  to</span><span>  which  we  have  called  attention,  the</span><span>  more  urgent  does  it  appear  to  us  that</span><span>  the  Government  should  give  it  their</span><span>  earnest  consideration.  An  opinion  has</span><span>  been  expressed  in  some  quarters  that  the</span><span>  Government  should  make  a  hydrographie</span><span>  survey  of  the  whole  colony,  with  the</span><span>  view  to  the  formation  of  a  general  plan</span></p> <p><span>  of  water  collection  and  distribution.</span><span>  However  desirable  that  would  be,  we</span><span>  are  afraid  the  scheme  would  be  of  too</span></p> <p><span>  great  magnitude  and  cost  to  be  under-</span><span>  taken  at  present.  But  we  see  no  reason</span><span>  why  such  an  object  should  not  be  aimed</span><span>  at  by  'the  present  and  succeeding  Ad-</span></p> <p><span>  ministrations.  It  would  be  a  national</span></p> <p><span>  work  of  first  rate  importance  and  uni-</span><span>  versal  interest.  Though  it  might  not  be</span><span>  commenced  at  present,  it  should  certainly</span><span>  be  kept  in  view,  and  whatever  is  being</span></p> <p><span>  done  in  the  meantime  should  be  effected</span><span>  so  as  to  harmonise  with  it  in  future.</span></p> <p><span>  OUR  télégraphia  news  is  meagre  to-day  iii</span><span>  oonseqnonee  of  tho  transfer  of  bnBineBs  to  the</span><span>  telegraph  office  having  to  some  extent</span><span>  impeded  communication  with  the  south.</span></p> <p><span>  J  .THE  criminal  sittings  of  the  Central  District</span></p> <p><span>  Court  will  commence  this  morning  before</span><span>  Jadge  Miller.

The  only</span><span>  single  girl  available  for  hire,  has  found  a</span></p> <p><span>  place  at  10s.  a  week.  The  number  for  this</span><span>  post  was  26,  including  3  married  couples,  3</span><span>  single  women,  3  children,  and  14  single</span></p> <p><span>  men.</span></p> <p><span>  As  our  readers  are  aware  the  three  New</span></p> <p><span>  [  Caledonian  escapees,  who  landed  at  Toorilla</span></p> <p><span>  a  short  time  since,  were  brought  to  town  on</span><span>  Friday  night.  The  steamer  Heka,  with  Con-</span><span>  stable  Siebert  on  board,  left  here  on  Wednes-</span><span>  day,  the  21st  March,  and  experienced  very</span><span>  rough  weather  all  the  way  to  Stannage  Bay,</span><span>  where  she  arrived  about  five  o'clock  on  the</span><span>  afternoon  of  the  29th  ultimo.  The  escapees</span><span>  were  all  at  Mr.  Rogers'  station  when  Con-</span><span>  stable  Siebert  got  there,  and  at  the  request  of</span><span>  Mr.  Rogers  the  constable  did  not  put  them  in</span><span>  handcuffs  or  close  confinement,  as  that  gentle-</span><span>  man  promised  to  be  responsible  for  them.</span><span>  They  remained  there  roaming  about  at</span><span>  liberty  till  they  saw  the  steamer  ap-</span><span>  proaching  the  bay,  when  two  of  them</span><span>  Charles  Guerin  and  Alphonse  Camus  took  to</span><span>  tho  bush.  This  was  on  the  1st  April.  A</span><span>  fpursuit  was  started  and  after  a  ride  of  about</span><span>  forty  miles  they  were  found  walking  in  the</span><span>  direction  of  Rockhampton.  They  were  then</span><span>  brought  back  to  Stannage  Bay  and  arrested.</span><span>  ,  Next  day  they  were  taken  on  board  the</span></p> <p><span>  steamer,  and  arrived  in  Rockhampton,  after  a</span></p> <p><span>  very  rough  voyage,  on  Friday  night  about</span><span>  nine  o'clock.  During  a  gale  met  with  on  the</span><span>  home  trip  the  steamer  had  to  put  in  to  a  small</span><span>  bay  about  twenty-seven  miles  from  the</span><span>  mouth  of  the  river.  Here  those  in  charge</span><span>  went  ashore  and  got  wood  and  some  food,</span><span>  both  of  which  they  had  run  short  of  owing  to</span><span>  the  length  of  tho  voyage.  At  one  time  the</span><span>  steamer  only  made  about  three  or  four  miles</span><span>  in  three  hours.  The  escapees'  conduct,  we  are</span><span>  informed,  was  extraordinarily  good,  and  they</span><span>  behaved  themselves  like  men  who  had  nothing</span><span>  at  all  to  fear.  The  length  of  the  boat  in</span><span>  which  they  came  from  New  Caledonia  is</span><span>  16  ft  9  in.,  the  depth  3ft.  41/2  in.,  and  the</span><span>  breadth  5  ft.  71/2  in.  It  is  in  a  very  bad  con-</span><span>  dition,  the  bottom  being  nearly  all  smashed</span><span>  out  by  being  cast  on  the  rocks.  In  it  there</span></p> <p><span>  is  room  for  fifteen  persons.  No  name  can  be.</span></p> <p><span>  traced  on  it.    The  men  state  that  they  had</span></p> <p><span>  672  francs  and  60  centimes  before  the  boat  was</span><span>  wrecked,  and  every  day  while  they  remained</span><span>  at  Mr.  Rogers  they  were  diving  for  the  money</span></p> <p><span>  as  soon  as  the  tide  was  low  enough,  but  ~</span><span>  though  they  could  see  it,  they  were  unable  to'</span><span>  get  it  owing  to  the  roughness  of  the  weather.  '</span><span>  They  have,  however,  picked  up  on  the  rocks</span><span>  the  following  articles  they  had  before  they</span><span>  were  wrecked  -  two  towels,  one  shirt,  one  pair</span><span>  of  trousers,  the  rudder,  and  pieces  of  anchor</span><span>  chain.  As  is  stated  elsewhere,  they  were</span><span>  brought  before  the  Polioe  Magistrate  on  Satur,</span><span>  day  morning,  on  a  charge  of  having  no  lawful</span></p> <p><span>  visible  means  of  support,  and  remanded  until  ,</span><span>  ten  o'clock  this  morning.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Customs  collections  at  this  port  for  thu  j</span><span>  week  ended  .

Two</span><span>  youths  quarrelled  in  town,  and  deoided  to</span><span>  settle  their  slight  difference  by  an  appeal  to</span><span>  arms  and  fists.  Accompanied  by  a  number  of</span><span>  lads  of  varions  ages,  they  made  their  way  to</span><span>  tho  battle  ground.  For  twenty  minutes  they</span><span>  pounded  away  at  each  other  in  the  most</span><span>  approved  style.

Nearly  five  millions  have  in  thia  way</span><span>  been  added  to  the  population  of  the  States</span><span>  since  1870,  including  of  course  that  year.

It</span><span>  appears  that  Mrs.  Atkinson,  fruiterer,  Agnes</span><span>  street,  South  Shields,  left  by  tho  6.54  p.m.</span><span>  train  for  Newcastle,  having  in  her  possession</span><span>  moneys  amounting  to  between  £40  and  £50,</span><span>  with  which  she  intonded  to  discharge  certain</span><span>  bills  or  purchase  new  stock.  On  the  train</span><span>  arrivingat  Jarrow  station,  the  gusrd'sottention</span><span>  was  direoted  to  tho  compartment  into  which</span><span>  Mrs.  Atkinson  had  entered  at  Shields.  It</span><span>  was  then  discovered  that  she  was  lying  at  the</span><span>  bottom  of  the  compartment,  apparently  in  a</span><span>  fit.  She  was  found  to  be  unconscious,  and</span><span>  was  conveyed  to  her  home,  when  it  was  found</span><span>  that  her  pocket  containing  the  money  had</span><span>  been  wronohed  from  ber  dress  and  was  gone.</span><span>  She  was  still  unconscious  at  noon.

Tho  imagina</span><span>  tion  shrinks  from  attempting  to  reconstruc</span><span>  tho  history  of  the  poor  child  whose  body  wai</span><span>  lately  found  in  s  starch  box.  That  she  wai</span><span>  murdered  seems  certain,  that  6he  wa:</span><span>  murdered  with  oircomstances  of  great  cruelty</span><span>  seems  probable.  Worse  than  all,  as  no  one</span><span>  has  missed  the  girl,  as  no  search  was  made  for</span><span>  her,  aa  no  one  has  reoognised  her,  it  is  a</span><span>  natural  inference  that  she  was  destroyed  by</span><span>  the  people  who  knew  ber  best,  and  ought</span><span>  moat  to  have  cherished  her.  A  story  not</span><span>  much  less  unpleasant  is  told  by  a  correspon-</span><span>  dent  of  the  Daily  Netos.

""  lier  condition  was  terrible,  end</span><span>  defies  all  description.""  At  the  Bromley  work-</span><span>  house  she  was  carefully  and  kindly  nursed  and</span><span>  restored  to  life.  She  is  apparently  about</span><span>  fiftoeu  years  of  age,  has  given  different  names,</span><span>  and  absolutely  refuses  to  say  who  her  parents</span><span>  are,  whence  abo  came,  or  bow  she  wandered</span><span>  to  a  suburban  common  and  nearly  starved  to</span><span>  death  there.  She  is  pretty,  well  educated,</span><span>  and  was  not  badly  dressed.  Two  hypotheses</span><span>  suggest  themselves-thc  first  that  the  girl  bas</span><span>  been  cruelly  treated  at  borne  ;  thc  second  that</span><span>  she  has  beeft  drawn  away  from  homo  or  per-</span><span>  haps  kidnapped,  and  is  ashamed  to  return.</span></p> <p><span>  The  correspondent  who  tells  this  story  iii  the  I</span></p> <p><span>  *r  l  ri</span></p> <p><span>  [BpitiNeus  believes  that  thçsSiri  ""Ml</span></p> <p><span>  «ander  off  again  to  avoid  identity,  meaning</span><span>  to  avojfl  being  identified.

Under  these  circumstances</span><span>  the  work  of  recovery  was  a  tedious  one,  and</span><span>  was  not  completed  till  about  3  o'clock  in  the</span><span>  afternoon,  when  the  corpses  were  found  to  be</span><span>  in  a  terribly  mutilated  condition.  The  names</span><span>  of  tho  unfortunate  men  are  Thomas  Collis  (50),</span><span>  fireman,  married,  with  six  children  ;  Hebert</span><span>  Grimley  (25),  pit  blacksmith,  married  ;  and</span><span>  Francis  Horton  (19),  unmarried-all  of  Chase</span><span>  town.  The  rope  had  boen  properly  tested</span><span>  before  the  men  were  let  down,  and  nothing</span><span>  was  noticed  as  indipating  that  it  was  at  all</span><span>  faulty.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  INFLUJISCE  OP  FOOD  OH  GOWS,-Pro-  :</span></p> <p><span>  fessor  Sheldon  Bays  that  the  proportion  of  |</span><span>  butter  in  milk  was  much  more  easily  influenced</span><span>  by  changes  of  food  than  was  the  proportion  of</span><span>  casein  ;  so  that  it  followed  that  the  nitrogenous</span></p> <p><span>  Was  more  oonstant  than  the  non-nitrogenous  ,</span><span>  matter.  Thus  the  improvement  of  milk  was</span><span>  more  in  the  direction  of  an  increase  of  fatty</span><span>  matter,  and  less  in  that  of  an  increase  of</span><span>  cheesy  matter  ;  therefore  the  high  feeding  of</span><span>  cattle  was  moro  advantageous  when  the  milk</span><span>  was  used  for  butter  than  when  it  was  used  for</span><span>  cheese.  On  tho  Derbyshire  hills  it  was  a</span><span>  common  saying  that  ""  the  poorest  land  made</span><span>  tho  beat  cheese,""  Paradoxical  as  this  might</span><span>  bo,  it  was  absolutely  true,  although  it</span><span>  assumed  that  the  poor  land  was  sound,  in</span><span>  that  it  required  no  artificial  drainage.  CheeBO</span><span>  produced  npon  such  land  os  this,  if  properly</span><span>  made,  would  be  better  than  that  produced</span><span>  apon  richer  soil,  The  quantity  per  acre  was</span><span>  less,  but  the  quality  was  superior.  Tho</span><span>  reason  of  th¡B  was  supposed  to  bo  that  the</span><span>  f;rass  grown  on  rich  land  contained  a  much</span><span>  arger  proportion  of  the  elements  which  went</span><span>  to  form  fat,  while  that  grown  on  poor  land</span><span>  contained  a  larger  proportion  of  the  clomcnts</span><span>  which  went  to  form  flesh,  from  the  latter  of</span><span>  which  cheese  was  made.  Another  considera-</span><span>  tion  was  that  it  was  a  much  simpler  and</span><span>  easier  thing  to  make  good  eheese  on  sound</span><span>  poor  land  than  apon  rich  land.</span></p> <p><span>  DISTRESSING  SHIPWRECK.-The  following</span><span>  acoount  of  a  distressing  shipwreck,  and  the</span><span>  severe  Bufferings  endured  by  the  survivors,  is</span><span>  given  by  the  Boulogne  correspondent  of  Thc</span><span>  Tima,  telegraphing  on  February  7:-""The</span><span>  Kenmare  Castle,  commanded  by  Captain</span><span>  Barrett,  of  the  Castle  line  of  steamers,  left</span><span>  London  on  January  23  for  Hongkong.</span><span>  Sevoral  mishaps  befell  her  prior  to  ber  leaving</span><span>  the  Channel,  and  she  encountered  a  strong</span><span>  south-westerly  gale  in  the  Bay  of  Biscay,  the</span><span>  bigh  Beas  completely  destroying  her  steering</span><span>  goar.

"<p><span>  KOCICUAMI'TON.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY.  APRIL  28,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  disciples  of  dynamite  appear  to  be</span><span>  increasing  and  multiplying  exceedingly.</span><span>  The  scare  created  in  London  and  the</span><span>  other  large  towns  in  England,  by  the</span><span>  explosions  and  rumours  of  explosions,</span><span>  seems  to  be  almost  equal  to  the  terror</span><span>  which  they  have  inspired  in  Russia.</span><span>  Since  the  announcement  came  to  hand,</span><span>  that  the  coronation  of  the  Czar  was</span></p> <p><span>  positively  fixed  for  an  early  date,  antici-</span><span>  pations  of  plots  and  disasters  have  led</span><span>  people  to  wonder  whether,  indeed,  the</span><span>  ceremonial  would  take  place,  or  whether</span><span>  another  postponement  was  inevitable.</span><span>  It  is  understood  that  the  27  th  of  next</span><span>  month  is  the  day  named  for  the  cere-</span><span>  mony,  and  we  may  be  sure  that  every</span><span>  possible  precaution  will  be  taken,  to  pre-</span><span>  vent  the  intrusion  of  any  unlriendly  and</span><span>  unwelcome  guests,  at  the  stately  cere-</span><span>  mony,  which  is  then  fixed  to  take  place.</span><span>  In  spite  of  this,  however,  there  can</span><span>  hardly  fail  to  be  many  gloomy  fore-</span><span>  bodings  among  thc  loyal  subjects  of  thc</span><span>  Czar  Alexander.  The  air  of  Russia,  as</span><span>  well  as  the  air  of  the  whole  European</span><span>  continent,  is  full  of  the  germs  of</span><span>  Socialism,  Anarchy,  and  Nihilism,  and</span><span>  the  ranks  of  secret  societies  include  men</span><span>  of  all  positions,  from  those  of  the</span><span>  lowest  order  of  life,  to  men  moving  in</span><span>  the  highest  court  circles.  Many  of  the</span><span>  Nihilist  conspirators  and  assassins  have</span><span>  already  met,  on  the  scaffold  ;  a  death</span><span>  which  few  will  say  was  not  deserved;</span><span>  but  at  the  same  time,  there  does  not</span><span>  appear  to  be  the  slightest  decrease  in</span><span>  thal  fierce  and  bitter  political  discontent,</span><span>  which  existed  when  the  present  Em-</span><span>  peror  came  to  his  throne  under  circum-</span><span>  stances  of  peculiar  horror  and  atrocity.</span><span>  Indeed,  if  the  latest  news  is  to  be  con-</span><span>  sidered  reliable,  the  Nihilists  appear  to</span><span>  be  getting  more  and  more  exasperated,</span><span>  at  the  refusal  of  the  Emperor  to  grant</span><span>  the  demands  on  which  they  insist,  and</span><span>  they  now  go  so  far  as  to  threaten  the  son</span><span>  with  the  fate  of  the  father,  in  consequence</span><span>  of  his  obstinacy.  The  boasted  civilisa-</span><span>  tion  of  the  nineteenth  century  may  now</span><span>  surely  be  regarded  as  myth,  for  if  thc</span><span>  advance  of  knowledge  has  made  known</span><span>  the  existence  of  dynamite,  that  very</span><span>  knowledge  has  also  taught,  men  this</span><span>  tremendous  power  as  a  new  force  in  the</span><span>  hands  of  conspirators.  Buildings  are  to</span><span>  be  shattered,  lives  are  to  be  lost,</span><span>  in  order  to  compel  England  to  let</span><span>  Ireland  go  ;  and  in  Russia,  one</span><span>  Czar  is  murdered,  and  his  successor</span><span>  threatened  with  a  similar  fate,  unless</span><span>  the  socialistic  demands  of  the</span><span>  secret  societies  are  complied  with.'</span><span>  What  will  he  the  outcome  of  the  struggle</span><span>  it  is  impossible  to  predict.  In  England,</span><span>  indeed,  all  the  explosions  that  are</span><span>  threatened  and  talked  of,  even  if  they</span><span>  look  place,  would  be  little  likely  to</span><span>  accomplish  the  end  desired  by  their</span><span>  perpetration.  Damage  to  property,  and</span><span>  loss  of  life  might  be  caused,  but  the  cul-</span><span>  prits  would  in  due  time  bc  brought  to</span><span>  justice,  and  matters  would  otherwise  go</span><span>  on  as  before.  In  Prussia  the  state  of</span><span>  affairs  is  entirely  different,  and  it  is</span><span>  interesting  now  to  recall  certain  words</span><span>  spoken  by  M.  Gambella  about  Russia</span><span>  and  her  political  condition.  In</span><span>  Russia,  M.  Gambetta  said,  lhere  are,</span><span>  to  all  intents  and  purposes,  three</span><span>  Governments,-the  official  Government</span><span>  of  the  CZJX,  the  semi-official  Government</span><span>  of  llic  l'anslavists,  and  thc  Revolutionary</span></p> <p><span>  Government  of  the  Nihilists.  ""  Thc</span><span>  official  Government  of  the  Czar  is  at</span><span>  St.  Petersburg,  the  Government  of  the</span><span>  l'anslavists  may  be  presumed  to  bc  at</span><span>  Moscow,  bul  the  Revolutionary  Govern-</span><span>  ment  of  the  Nihilists  is  everywhere  -</span><span>  among  the  officials  of  the  Empire,  the</span><span>  bourgeoisie,  and  thc  common  people.</span><span>  Many  of  ils  leaders  have  been  executed  ;</span><span>  many  more  are  in  prison  :  but  still  it</span><span>  cannot  be  doubled  that  some  are  com-</span><span>  fortably  quartered  in  palaces  and  Slate</span><span>  buildings.""  In  this  lies  the  danger.</span><span>  Nihilism  is  so  widely  spread  among  all</span><span>  classes,  that  it  might  bc  as  well,  if</span><span>  the  Czar  determined  to  deal  with</span><span>  what  may  almost  be  termed  a  national</span><span>  movement  by  other  means  than  by</span><span>  repression,  imprisonment,  and  the</span></p> <p><span>  scaffold  ;  but,  under  present  conditions,</span><span>  it  seems  almost  certain  that  another</span><span>  catastrophe  is  sooner  or  later  inevitable</span><span>  The  gradual  spread  of  the  principles  of</span><span>  Communism  and  Nihilism  is  one  of  the</span><span>  most  alarming  features  of  European</span><span>  Society  at  the  present  time,  for  although</span><span>  the  secret  societies  possess  more  power</span><span>  in  Russia  than  in  other  countries,  it  is</span><span>  because  of  the  wide  spread  political</span><span>  disaffection,  and  the  intolerable  burden</span><span>  that  the  people  feel,  in  living  under</span><span>  autocratic  institutions.  In  France  and</span><span>  Germany  similar  powers  are  at  work,</span><span>  but  though,  in  the  former  country,</span><span>  the  Republican  form  of  Government</span><span>  appears  at  present  to  act  as  a</span><span>  species  of  safety  valve,  whereby  the</span><span>  expression  of  popular,  discontent  is</span><span>  afforded  full  vent  ;  in  the  latter  country,</span><span>  the  lorces  of  Socialism  are  only  at  pre-</span><span>  sent  kept  in  check  by  military  despotism,</span><span>  and  the  iron  rule  of  the  Chancellor</span><span>  Bismarck.  In  the  smaller  and  adjoining</span><span>  countries,  similar  forces  are  at  work,  and</span><span>  though,  at  the  present  time,  England</span><span>  appears  to  be  suffering  under  a  tem-</span><span>  porary  infliction  of  the  same  description,</span><span>  she  is  indeed  the  only  country  in  which</span><span>  discontent  and  conspiracy  is  con</span><span>  I  fined  to  a  very  small  portion  of</span></p> <p><span>  Her  Majesty's  dominions.  The  disease</span><span>  I  is,  indeed,  localised  ;  and  on  this</span></p> <p><span>  account  cannot  be  considered  incurable.</span><span>  13ut  in  Europe  such  is  not  the  case,</span><span>  and  it  would  be  a  foolish  attempt,  on  the</span><span>  part  of  any  political  prophet,  to  predict</span><span>  the  fate  of  those  dynasties,  which  are</span><span>  now  seated  on  the  various  thrones  of</span><span>  Continental  Europe.  The  future,  indeed,</span><span>  of  the  old  world  is  dark  and  uncertain,</span><span>  and  though  Australia  is  far  removed  from</span><span>  the  scenes  of  conspiracies,  and  their  con-</span><span>  sequent  deeds  of  violence,  yet  it  is</span><span>  impossible  that  a  great  many  must</span><span>  regard  with  the  deepest  anxiety,  the</span><span>  various  dangers  and  difficulties  to  which</span><span>  our  mojlicr  country,  as  well  as  the  other</span><span>  European  communities,  are  now  exposed.</span></p> <p><span>  A  I'ltrsoNun  named  George  Roberts,  under</span><span>  committal  for  trial  at  the  next  District  Court</span><span>  here,  on  a  charge  of  larceny,  arrived  in</span><span>  custody  of  constablo  Johnson  from  Bogan-</span><span>  tungan  by  yesterday  ovening's  train.</span></p> <p><span>  I  SHE  (writes  tho  Courier's  Melbourne  corres-</span><span>  pondent),  yon  had  a  tologram  stating  that  Mr.</span><span>  F.

In  some  respects  also  thc  future  of</span><span>  New  Guinea  is  of  more  consequence  to</span><span>  Great  Britain  than  that  of  Fiji.  If  wc  do  not</span><span>  take  New  G  niñea,  Borne  other  Power  will  ;</span><span>  ami  in  thc  hands  of  Germany  or  France  or</span><span>  Italy  thc  island  would  involve  more  expense</span><span>  and  more  trouble  than  are  likely  tu  bc  thc</span><span>  result  of  its  passiug  iuto  those  of  Queensland.</span><span>  Tho  Imperial  Government  will  do  well  to</span><span>  look  at  both  sides  of  the  question.  No  doubt</span><span>  the  step  which  has  been  taken  is  an  unusual</span><span>  one.  We  may  add  that  it  is  a  matter  for</span><span>  regret  that  a  policy  which  so  materially  affects</span><span>  the  whole  of  thc  colouies  catiuot  in  some  way</span><span>  or  other  tic  discussed  by  the  colouies  as  a</span><span>  whole.  On  thc  other  hand,  however,  it  must</span><span>  bc  remembered  that,  great  as  may  bc  the</span></p> <p><span>  interest  of  New  South  Wales  or  Victoria  in</span><span>  the  future  of  New  Guinea,  thc  interest  of</span><span>  Queensland  is  much  greater.  Further,  if  the</span><span>  political  objections  to  thc  present  method  of</span><span>  annexation  are  considerable,  thc  Imancial</span><span>  injections  are  small.  If  the  Home  Govern-</span><span>  ment  were  to  anucx  New  Guinea,  it  would</span><span>  have  to  set  up  au  establishment  there,  but  as</span><span>  part  of  the  colony  of  Queensland,  New  Guinea</span><span>  will  require  no  separate  Governor  and  no</span><span>  separate  *y8tem  of  government.  As  to  tho</span><span>  mutter  of  protection,  wu  have  already  in-</span><span>  timated  that  it  is  not  at  all  likely  that  in  tho</span><span>  keeping  of  tho  cidonius  New  Guiuea  will  givo</span><span>  th«  Homo  Government  nor«  trouble  tiiaa</span></p> <p><span>  would  result  from  ¡ts  being  annexed  by</span><span>  strangers.  Upon  the  wholo,  we  see  no</span><span>  cause  for  the  annoyance  which  the  action  of</span><span>  Mr.  Chester  has  occasioned  in  the  House  of</span><span>  Commons.</span></p> <p><span>  WK  have  to  remind  those  desirous  of  heariug</span><span>  intellectual  lectures  on  subjects  of  interest</span><span>  that  the  first  of  thc  scries  on  the  world's  life</span></p> <p><span>  history,  «rill  be  delivered  by  Mr.  William</span><span>  Denton  on  Monday  night.

Oran  and  bis</span><span>  sons,  was  submitted  to  a  formal  christening</span><span>  ccromony  on  Friday  night,  when  a  large  con-</span><span>  course  of  guests  from  all  parts  of  the  colony</span><span>  assembled  at  the  invitation  of  Mrs.  Cran  to</span><span>  participate  in  the  pleasures  of  a  ball  in  tho</span><span>  Refinery.  The  occasion  was  something  more</span><span>  than  an  act  of  private  hospitality,  and  the</span><span>  compliment  BO  gracefully  paid  to  the  numerous</span><span>  residents  in  the  district  who  figured  as  gueBts</span><span>  was  highly  appreciated.  The  services  of  thc</span><span>  Maryborough  Town  Band  were  called  into</span><span>  requisition,  and  the  spacious  doors  of  Milla-</span><span>  quin  afforded  room  for  tasteful  decorations</span><span>  and  appointments  such  as  seldom  greet  thc</span><span>  festive  eye  in  those  latitudes.  Tho  joyous</span><span>  proceedings  lasted  till  a  late  hour,  and  thc</span><span>  numerous  contingent  of  Maryborough  guests</span><span>  left  the  ball  room  for  the  steamer  Queens-</span><span>  land  on  Saturday  morning,  tired  but  happy,</span></p> <p><span>  ÏHE11K  was  quito  a  stir  in  crickctiug  circles</span><span>  here  this  week  whon  it  was  announced  that  a</span><span>  redoubtable  wielder  of  the  willow,  named</span><span>  Bannerman,  had  arrived  in  Rockhampton.</span><span>  Each  leading  club  was  dcsirouB  of  inter-</span><span>  viewing  him,  if  only  to  enrol  bim  as  an</span><span>  honorary  member,  to  try  conclusions  with  au</span><span>  opposing  eleven.  Some  said  it  was  thc  re-</span><span>  doubtable  Charley  Bannerman,  tho  whilom</span><span>  champion  batter,  whose  praises  everyone  saug</span><span>  until  he  began  to  Bhow  a  falling-oil  in  cricket.</span><span>  Others  were  positive  in  their  assurances  it  was</span><span>  ""  Gentle  ""  Alick,  tho  yuuug  brother,  who  has</span><span>  so  lately  distinguished  himself.  The  new</span><span>  arrha),  Ike  Bauucruian,  was  ""trotted""  out</span><span>  to  ibo  practice  ground,  and  handled  the  bat.</span><span>  An  authority  on  cricket  mattera  thought</span><span>  ho  Bbaped  fairly.  Just  faucy  a  cricket</span><span>  celebrity  like  Bannerman  shaping  fairly.  The</span><span>  idea  seems  preposterous  in  Rockhampton,</span></p> <p><span>  when  oue  remembers  how  thc  brothers</span></p> <p><span>  played  for  thoir  side  on  the  greca  sward.</span></p> <p><span>  But  still  more  so  when  it  became  known  that  I</span><span>  Uie  Bannerman  was  an  ex-detective  officer  from</span><span>  Brisbane.  How  our  local  cricketors  could  have</span><span>  got  up  so  much  excitement  without  iuquiry</span><span>  appears  somewhat  strange,  Still  they  live  aud</span><span>  will  learn.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  concert  given  by  Mrs.  Bridson's  pupils</span><span>  last  night,  as  was  anticipated,  was  a  success  in</span><span>  cvory  way,  the  hall  of  the  School  of  Arts  being</span><span>  crowded.  The  concert  was  opened  by  thc</span><span>  singing  of  the  chorus  ""Credo,""  by  eleven</span><span>  young  ladies,  in  a  very  pleasing  manner.  This</span><span>  was  followed  by  tho  solo  ""The  Red  Robin,""</span><span>  which  Miss  Mackean  saug  with  great  Bwectucss</span><span>  and  clearness.  She  was  assisted  in  thc</span><span>  chorus  by  ten  other  ladies.  A  duct  on</span><span>  two  pianos  was  the  next  item  oo  the</span><span>  list,  aud  was  well  executed,  tho  players  keep-</span><span>  ing  excellent  time.  Miss  L.  Lloyd  rendered</span><span>  tho  solo  ""Geraldine  ""  very  effectively,  behm</span><span>  applauded  at  the  finish.  MIBB  Lona  Hill's</span><span>  playing  of  the  instrumental  solo,  ""Carnival</span><span>  de  Venise,""  was  excellent  ;  as  was  also  tho</span><span>  singing  of  ""  After  ""  by  Miss  Jennie  Davis.</span><span>  Misses  M.  Murphy  and  S.  Lloyd  next  gave</span><span>  the  vocal  duct  ""QuiB  Est  Homo""  in  such  a  style</span><span>  as  to  ""  bring  down  tho  house,""  thc  way  tho</span><span>  first-named  young  lady  went  up  the  high  parts</span><span>  being  excellent.  A  duet  on  two  pianos  was</span><span>  followed  by  the  solo  ""  For  You,""  which  Miss</span><span>  Mackean  again  rendered  very  sweetly.  A</span><span>  chorus,  ""  When  life  is  brightest,""  followed,</span><span>  Thc  first  part  concludod  with  ""  'Tis  the  Harp</span><span>  in  the  Air,""  by  Miss  L.  Lloyd.  The  second</span><span>  part  commenced  with  thc  solo  ""  Thc  Rest  of</span><span>  the  Story,""  givou  by  Miss  Jennie  Davis  very</span><span>  pleasantly,  which  was  followed  by  a  piano</span><span>  solo  by  Miss  Youug.  As  soon  as  Miss  Maggie</span><span>  Murphy  appeared  on  thc  stage  Bbc  was  greeted</span><span>  with  applause,  as  by  ber  singing  in  the  duct</span><span>  in  the  lirst  part  those  present  expected  a</span><span>  treat,  and  they  were  not  disappointed,  as  she</span><span>  sang  the  ballad  ""  Waiting  ""  with  groat  feeling</span><span>  and  swectucss.  Miss  Sarah  Lloyd  rendered  thc</span><span>  solo  .*  Alas  those  Chimes""  very  well.  Another</span><span>  quartette  herc  came  in,  and  Miss  Murphy</span><span>  gave  ""Oh,  how  Delightful  ""  in  such  a  manner</span><span>  as  to  elicit  au  cucore.  A  chorus  was  next</span><span>  givcu  by  eleven  ladies,  followed  by  thc  ballad,</span><span>  ""Oh,  Erin  My  Country,""  which  Miss</span><span>  Sarah  Lloyd  saug  excellently.  The  con-</span><span>  cert  was  concluded  by  nu  instrumental</span><span>  quartette,  and  the  comic  chorus  ""The</span><span>  Attractive  Girl,""  the  Inst  verso  of  which  bad</span><span>  to  bu  repeated  in  response  to  an  encore.  The</span><span>  way  tho  selections  on  tho  piano  were  given</span><span>  reflects  great  credit  on  their  instructress,  Mrs.</span><span>  Bridson.  The  singing  of  thc  Misses  Murphy,</span><span>  Mackean,  and  Lloyd  were  the  features  of  the</span><span>  evening,  and  wo  arc  sure  all  who  visited  tho</span><span>  School  of  Arts  last  night  cujoyed  a  treat.</span></p> <p><span>  TiiKRK  were  no  cases  for  hearing  at  the</span><span>  Police  Court  yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>  Tm:  usual  monthly  meeting  of  thc  Farmers'</span><span>  and  Selectors'  Association  will  bc  held  this</span><span>  morning.

They</span><span>  tried,  on  different  oocasions,  to  select  land  or</span><span>  purchase  it,  and  the  answer  on  all  occasions</span><span>  was  simply  no.  Now,  let  any  one  look  at  the</span><span>  gardens  along  the  Central  Railway,  and  see  if</span><span>  they  can  say  it  is  impossible  to  make  a  home</span><span>  for  families.

Now,</span><span>  Mr.  Editor,  is  it  consistent  with  the  land  laws</span><span>  in  this  country,  that  all  along  the  Central</span><span>  Railway,  from  Gogango  to  the  head  of  the</span><span>  line,  there  is  not  one  foot  of  land  to  be  either</span><span>  selected  or  purchased,  or  obtained  even  for  the</span><span>  grace  of  God.

"<p><span>  KOCK  ll  A  M  l'TO  N.</span></p> <p><span>  SATUHDAY.  AUGUST  IS,  1SS3.</span></p> <p><span>  Tun  news  that  Sir  Stafford  Northcote's</span><span>  motion  repudiating  M.  de  Lesseps  claim</span><span>  to  a  monopoly  of  Canal  construction</span><span>  across  the  Isthmus  of  Suez,  has  been  re-</span><span>  jected  by  a  lar^e  majority  in  thc  English</span><span>  House  of  Commons  seems  to  intimate</span><span>  that  Mr.  Gladstone  will  be  left  almost</span><span>  unfettered  as  to  the  course  he  deems</span></p> <p><span>  advisable  to  pursue  in  the  matter.  The</span><span>  preliminary  agreement  whic</span></p> <p><span>  entered  into  between  the  English  '</span><span>  Government  and  M.  de  Lesseps  pro-</span><span>  vided  that  the  Suez  Canal  Company</span><span>  were  to  make  another  Canal  alongside</span><span>  their  present  one,  on  condition  that  the</span><span>  English  Government  give  securities</span><span>  fur  the  land  required,  and  provide</span><span>  ^8,000,000  for  the  execution  of  the</span><span>  works,  the  Company  in  return  consent-</span><span>  ing  to  allow  an  Englishman  to  occupy</span></p> <p><span>  the  office  of  vice-President  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Directorate,  English  pilots  to  navigate</span><span>  vessels  through  the  channels  and  to  re-</span><span>  duce  to  some  extent  the  rate  of  charges.</span><span>  Naturally  enough  these  conditions  are</span><span>  regarded  as  quite  inadequate'  by  the</span><span>  English  shipowners,  and  as  they  own</span><span>  about  four-fifths  of  the  vessels  that  pass</span><span>  through  the  Canal,  it  seems  only  reason-</span><span>  able  that  they  should  expect  to  exert  a</span><span>  preponderating  influence  on  its  manage-</span><span>  ment.  The  high  rate  of  dues  and  the</span><span>  frequent  stoppages  and  delays  in  the</span><span>  present  canal,  have  already  acted  very</span></p> <p><span>  prejudicially  toward  British  interests,  and  |</span><span>  the  Chambers  of  Commerce  have  only</span><span>  represented  the  opinion  of  theshipowners</span><span>  and  the  public  in  protesting  against</span><span>  the  repetition  of  such  a  state  of  things</span><span>  in  the  second  Canal.  In  consequence  of</span><span>  such  an  expressed  opposition,  itseemsthat</span><span>  the  English  Government  despatched  Sir</span><span>  Charles  Rivers  Wilson  to  negotiate  with</span><span>  M.  de  Lesseps  as  to  the  financial  details</span><span>  of  the  new  scheme,  but  nothing  appears</span><span>  to  have  been  definitely  arranged,  for  M.</span><span>  de  Lesseps  has  announced  his  deter</span></p> <p><span>  mination  of  proceeding  with  the</span><span>  construction  of  the  second  Canal,</span><span>  and  promised  to  reduce  the  tariff</span><span>  charges  in  proportion  to  the  increased</span><span>  profits  realised.  That  the  duplication  of</span><span>  j  the  Canal  will  be  a  profitable  investment</span><span>  I  there  appears  no  room  to  doubt.  In</span></p> <p><span>  1882  the  gross  receipts  exceeded  those</span><span>  of  1881  by  upwards  of  .£370,000,</span><span>  I  or  nearly  3^  per  cent  on  ten  millions  of</span></p> <p><span>  !  capita!  ;  and  it  is  calculated  that  the  1</span></p> <p><span>  double  Canal,  with  the  increased  traffic,</span><span>  ,  would  pay  a  good  dividend  at  half  the</span></p> <p><span>  I  rates  which  are  at  present  exacted.</span></p> <p><span>  This  being  the  case,  and  it  being  the</span><span>  fact  that  this  large  amount  of  revenue  is</span><span>  i  furnished  almost  entirely  by  British</span><span>  I  shipping,  and  that  the  Canal  is  now  the</span></p> <p><span>  recognised  highway  between  England</span><span>  and  India,  as  well  as  her  Australian</span><span>  Colonies,  it  seems  a  manifest  injustice</span><span>  that  English  shipowners  should  have</span><span>  such  a  small  share  in  the  management.</span><span>  Mr.  Gladstone  has,  however,  admitted</span><span>  j  that  the  concessions  granted  to  M.  de</span><span>  !  Lesseps,  secured  to  the  present  company</span></p> <p><span>  the  exclusive  right  to  traffic  by  means  of</span><span>  I  a  Canal  to  the  Isthmus  of  Suez,  and</span></p> <p><span>  therefore  it  appears  that  it  will  be  neces-</span><span>  sary  for  the  present  to  acquiesce  in  the</span><span>  construction  of  the  second  Canal  by  the</span><span>  I  original  Company.  There  can  be  no</span><span>  I  doubt  also,  that  the  predominant  position</span></p> <p><span>  held  by  England  in  Egypt  is  a  source  of</span><span>  jealousyand  concern  to  French  politicians.</span><span>  The  successful  termination  to  which  the</span><span>  insurrection  of  Arabi  Pasha  was  brought</span><span>  by  the  English  troops,  was  a  bitter  pill</span><span>  for  a  nation  like  the  French  to  swallow.</span><span>  By  abstaining  from  co-operation  with</span></p> <p><span>  the  English  and  refusing  their  assistance</span><span>  to  maintain  order  in  Egypt,  they  thought</span><span>  to  embarass  the  British  Government,</span><span>  bul  now  find  that  they  took  the  one  step</span><span>  that  was  necessary  to  secure  the  pre-</span><span>  dominance  of  England.  The  only</span><span>  triumph  that  can  console  them  in  their</span><span>  dejection  is  that  the  Suez  Canal  was  a</span><span>  French  not  an  English  enterprise,  that</span><span>  even  the  idea  was  treated  by  English-</span><span>  men  as  chimerical,  and  then  when  its</span><span>  construction  was  satisfactorily  accom-</span><span>  plished  that  it  is  Englishmen,  more</span><span>  than  any  other  nation,  who  are</span><span>  forced  to  make  use  of  it.  Under</span><span>  the  circumstances,  it  is  natural  enough</span><span>  that  the  Suez  Canal  is  a  pet</span><span>  hobby  and  pride  of  most  Frenchmen</span><span>  and  that  it  is  regarded  as  a  species  of</span><span>  triumph  ovar  pervidious  Albion.  It</span><span>  may  therefore  be  supposed  that  Mr.</span><span>  Gladstone's  Government  consider  that  it</span><span>  would  be  both  unwise  and  impolitic  to</span><span>  adopt  any  course  that  would  offend  the</span><span>  easily  roused  susceptibilities  of  the</span><span>  French  in  this  matter.  The  second</span><span>  Canal  cannot  be  constructed  without</span><span>  money,  which  must  he  supplied  to  a</span><span>  great  extent  by  English  capitalists  and</span><span>  the  power  of  the  purse  will  therefore</span><span>  necessarily  remain  in  English  hands.</span><span>  Our  present  position  in  Egypt  also,</span><span>  makes  il  probable  that  in  time  of  war,  it</span><span>  would  be  incumbent  on  the  British</span></p> <p><span>  troops  Jboth  to  maintain  order  in  the</span><span>  country  and  to  secure  the  perfect  safety</span><span>  and  neutrality  of  the  Canals,  acourse  which</span><span>  might  thus  from  a  variety  of  reasons,  cause</span><span>  some  decided  change  to  be  made  in  the</span><span>  new  management  as  now  conducted  hy</span><span>  the  French  Company.

There  is  as  yet</span><span>  no  reason  to  doubt  that  matters  will  he</span><span>  put  on  a  satisfactory  footing  to  all</span><span>  concerned,  and  that  though  nuny</span><span>  complicated  details  will  necessarily</span><span>  have  to  be  discussed  before  any</span><span>  understanding  can  be  arrived  at,</span><span>  yet  M.  de  Lesseps  and  the  French</span><span>  Company  can  hardly  be  so  blind  to  their</span><span>  own  interests  as  to  risk  thc  construction</span><span>  of  any  rival  Canal  to  compete  with  their</span><span>  own.

"<p><span>  1</span></p> <p><span>  KOCK  II  A  Ml'  I  ON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  OCTOBER  29,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  WE  are  not  surprised  to  learn  that  the</span><span>  settlers  in  the  vicinity  of  Mackay  are</span><span>  beginning  to  complain  of  the  wanton</span><span>  and  complete  extermination  ot  birds  in</span><span>  that  district  by  the  Kanakas  employed</span><span>  on  the  sugar  plantations.  These</span><span>  coloured  gentry  have  come  within  the</span><span>  pale  of  Christianity,  so  far  as  Sabbath</span><span>  observance  is  concerned,  inasmuch  as</span><span>  they  enjoy  a  holiday  once  a  week,  which</span><span>  they  spend  in  roaming  about  with  fowl-</span><span>  ing  pieces,  and  more  primitive  engines  of</span><span>  destruction,  with  which  they  wage  a</span><span>  ruthless  war  upon  the  leathered  tribes.</span><span>  The  consequence  is  the  latter  are  rapidly</span><span>  disappearing.  We  dare  say  thc  settlers</span><span>  are  not  much  moved  to  complain  of  this</span><span>  on  aesthetic  grounds,  but  we  have  no</span><span>  doubt  many  of  them  are  touched  hy  the</span><span>  absence  of  the  vocalists  of  the  groves</span><span>  and  scrubs.  Though  the  songs  of  the</span><span>  latter  do  not  flood  the  car  with  melody</span><span>  like  the  lark  at  heaven's  gale  singing  ;</span><span>  like  the  throstle  cock,  with  yellow  bill,</span><span>  fluting  in  the  dawn  ;  like  the  mellow</span><span>  m  ivis  that  ""  hails  the  nightfall  ;""  or  like</span><span>  plaintive  Philomel,  mourning  in  the</span><span>  dewy  night,  their  ""  «¡ld  woodnotes,""</span><span>  possess  a  strange  chirm,  and  diffuse</span><span>  sweet  aiis  of  sound  amid  the  pre-</span><span>  vailing  silence  of  the  lovely  bush.</span><span>  Hut  apart  from  the  murder  of  nature's</span><span>  choristers,  and  the  enforced  silence  of</span><span>  thc  scrubs,  the  settlers  must  objjcl  to</span><span>  war  upon  winged  things,  on  the  ground</span><span>  thal  their  interests  are  thereby  likely  to</span><span>  suffer.  Even  though  they  have  no'  read</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  results  of  avicidc  in  other  coun-</span><span>  tries,  limited  consideration  and  observa-</span><span>  tion  will  convince  them  that  il  «ill  be</span><span>  detrimental  lo  their  interes's.  The  law</span><span>  of  life,  like  all  others  of  nature's  institu-</span><span>  tion,  cannot  be  rudely  and  wantonly</span><span>  violated,  without  ihose  who  commit  the</span><span>  outrage  being  penalised  in  consequence.</span><span>  Life  though  bestowed  with  prolusion  by</span><span>  Nature,  u  nevertheless  in  some  degree,</span><span>  as  il  were,  held  sacred  ;  and  its  wanton</span><span>  destruction  is  generally  followed  by  im-</span><span>  plosant  results.  When  the  balance  of</span><span>  power  is  destroyed  a  period  &lt;»f  disorder</span><span>  and  ceiier.il  sufTei'm^  follows.  Il  is</span><span>  probable  the  selectors  on  thc  Endeavour</span><span>  River  dread  the  material  consequences,</span><span>  which  are  likely  to  succeed  the  destruc</span></p> <p><span>  lion  of  their  bird  companions  ;  and  it  is</span><span>  well  they  are  alive  lo  ihe  danger.  Birds</span><span>  are  a  power  in  the  economy  of  the</span><span>  universe.  Like  oilier  creatures  they</span><span>  have  a  beneficent  work  to  do  in  main-</span><span>  taining  the  order  of  things  ;  and,</span><span>  if  they  are  interfered  willi  to  any</span><span>  great  extent,  their  work  is  not</span><span>  done,  and  physical  disorder  follows.</span><span>  This  has  been  repeatedly  taken  notice  of</span><span>  by  naturalists  and  students  of  life  in  its</span><span>  varied  forms.  In  many  countries  it  has</span></p> <p><span>  been  observed  that  when  birds  were</span><span>  destroyed  insect  pests  began  to  multiply,</span><span>  and  did  so  at  such  a  rapid  rate  that  their</span><span>  feathered  enemies  had  to  he  induced  to</span><span>  reappear  again  upon  the  scene,  or  mau</span></p> <p><span>  had  to  take  such  measures  as  were</span><span>  within  his  reach  to  restore  the  balance</span></p> <p><span>  of  power.  In  the  United  Kingdom</span><span>  gamekeepers  are  employed  to  kill  such</span><span>  wild  quadrupeds  and  birds  as  prey  upon</span><span>  game-birds  and  their  young.  Weasels,</span><span>  cats,  polecats,  martens  have  been</span><span>  abolished  from  the  list  of  native  fem</span><span>  natura:  ;  and  hawks,  owls,  jays,  magpies,</span><span>  crows  are  being  greatly  reduced  in</span><span>  numbers.  The  entire  disappearance  ol</span><span>  the  latter  is  only  a  question  of  lime,  if</span><span>  the  destructive  system  is  persisted  in.</span><span>  The  result  is  that  small  birds  of  the</span><span>  finch  tribe  have  been  contantly  on  the</span><span>  increase,  and  were  it  not  for  the  opera-</span><span>  tions  of  bird  catchers,  would  be  a  serious</span><span>  nuisance.  As  il  is,  tiley  are  pests  to  the</span><span>  farmers  and  seed  growers  of  the  southern</span><span>  counties.  The  stork-dove  or  wood</span></p> <p><span>  pigeon  has  also  increased  to  such  an</span><span>  extent  that  farmers  in  some  counties</span><span>  have  felt  compelled  to  form  societies  for</span><span>  its  destruction.  Prices  are  paid  for</span><span>  pigeon's  heads  and  eggs,  just  as  they  ave</span><span>  in  this  colony  for  marsupial  scalps.  In</span><span>  France  again  wild  animals  and  birds  of</span><span>  all  kinds  are  killed  for  the  pot,  and</span></p> <p><span>  the  land  seems  desolate  without  them.</span><span>  The  result  of  this  interference  with</span><span>  nature's  arrangements  is  that  insects</span><span>  have  become  plagues.  This  has  been</span><span>  more  remarkably  the  case  in  tropical</span><span>  countries.  Insect  life  in  them  is  more</span><span>  abundant,  and  varied  in  its  forms.</span><span>  Reports  from  South  Australia  inform  us</span><span>  the  farmers  there  have  been  suffering</span><span>  from  a  plague  of  grasshoppers.  The</span><span>  birds  seem  to  have  been  driven  out  by</span><span>  drought,  and  unchecked  in  their  increase</span><span>  the  locusts  are  ravaging  the  fields.</span><span>  Something  of  this  kind  is  doubtless</span><span>  what  the  farmers  near  Mackay  dread,</span><span>  and  with  good  reason.  While  birds  are</span><span>  death  to  grasshoppers,  we  must  not</span><span>  forget  they  also  live  upon  forms  of</span><span>  insect  life  not  so  noticeable  by  man.</span><span>  Insect-feeding  birds  do  not  confine</span><span>  themselves  to  one  article  of  diet,  and</span><span>  many  of  the  less  noticeable  species;</span><span>  of  insects  are  not  the  least  injurious  to</span><span>  vegetation.  Many  kinds  of  blight</span><span>  arise  from  minute  insects  living  on  the</span><span>  sap  of  the  plants  on  which  they  appear.</span><span>  These  animalada:  are  the  food  of  larger</span><span>  living  forms,  and  these  again  are  calen</span><span>  by  others,  till  birds  appear  as  the</span><span>  destroyers  of  the  more  robust.  There</span><span>  is  a  living  chain,  and  if  any  of  the  links</span><span>  be  broken  the  consequences  become</span><span>  apparent.  If  the  wanton  and  ruthless</span><span>  destruction  of  birds  is  continued  around</span><span>  Mackay,  there  is  every  reason  to  suppose</span><span>  that  the  canefields  may  suffer.  Of  this,</span><span>  we  may  be  certain,  thal  fruit  pests  will</span><span>  become  numerous.  In  their  crawling</span><span>  and  flying  slates,  insects  will  multiply,</span><span>  unrestricted  by  the  presence  of  their</span><span>  natural  enemies.  But  while  il  is  highly</span><span>  desirable  that  regard  should  be  paid  to</span><span>  the  wishes  of  the  agriculturists  at</span><span>  Mackay,  and  that  the  Kanakas  should</span><span>  be  restrained  in  their  destructive  pro-</span><span>  clivities,  some  method  should  he  observed</span><span>  in  the  matter.  Deslruclion  in  one</span><span>  sphere,  and  preservation  in  another,  are</span><span>  equally  liable  to  be  altended  with</span><span>  disagreeable  results.  If  any  regulations</span><span>  are  to  be  made  on  the  subject  they</span><span>  should  be  the  result  of  careful  and  con-</span><span>  tinued  experience.  Mere  haphazard</span><span>  rules  are  likely  to  do  as  much  harm  as</span><span>  good.  They  must  be  carefully  con-</span><span>  sidered,  and  some  care  must  be  exercised</span><span>  in  enforcing  them.  By  this  means</span><span>  legitimate  sport  may  be  preserved,  ihe</span><span>  laws  of  life  observed,  and  interference</span><span>  with  the  rural  industry  prevented.</span></p> ",Article,1883-10-29,"The Morning Bulletin.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  NOVEMBER  IO,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  WEER.</span></p> <p><span>  SIR  ANTHONY  M  usn  HAVE,  Govornor  of</span><span>  Quoouslanrl,  reached  Brisbane  on  Tuesday</span><span>  last,  and  Parliament  having  put  off  its  meet-</span><span>  ing  for  a  day,  ile  was  received  with  all  the</span><span>  pomp  and  dignity  becoming  bis  High  position  ;</span><span>  he  was  nccomp{uicd  by  Lady  Musgravo.  On</span><span>  Tuesday  he  vPis  sworn  into  office  as  Ad-</span><span>  ministrator  of  tho  Colony,  and  on  Thursday</span><span>  was  present  at  the  opening  nf  Parliament.</span><span>  His  speech  was  a  manifesto  of  the  policy  of</span><span>  thc  Ministry,  lt  is  penned  as  if  tho  projects</span><span>  in  it  were  to  bo  carried  out,  but  there  is  uot</span><span>  thc  least  likelihood  nt  that  being  done  fur</span><span>  come  time  to  come  at  least.  One  ol'jeet  of</span><span>  the  Ministry  in  meeting  Parliament  has  evi-</span><span>  dently  been  to  get  on  opportunity  of</span><span>  laying  before  the  country,  in  an  explicit</span><span>  anil  formal  manner,  a  list  nf  tho  matters</span><span>  they  deem  of  most  pressing  interest,</span><span>  and  which  should  command  thc  attention  of</span><span>  tho  legislature.  This  also  appears  from  the</span><span>  proceedings  in  Parliament  ou  Thursday</span><span>  evening.  Ministers  brought  forward  a  motion</span><span>  fer  printing  the  proposed  expenditure  of</span><span>  estimates  in  )  883-4.  The  Hou.  S.  Vf.  Griffith</span><span>  moved  they  bu  nut  printed,  SD  that  thc  paper</span><span>  might  not  hecotnr;  a  record  of  thc  House.</span><span>  Tho  House  rejected  the  proposal,  .ind  others</span><span>  of  a  similar  character,  submitted  with  a</span><span>  similar  object.  Tho  Premier  then  spoke,  and</span><span>  embodied  thc  contentB  of  tbc  papers  in  bis</span><span>  Bpeoch.  After  sonic  discussion  the  House</span><span>  adjourned  till  Tuesday  next,</span></p> <p><span>  BEFORE  the  echoes  of  thc  distant  contest  in</span><span>  the  Cook  electorate  have  died  away,  thora  come</span><span>  from  Brisbane  tho  reverberations,  which  tell  of</span><span>  the  concluding  battlo  iu  tho  great  electoral</span><span>  struggle.  At  the  polls  thc  Ministry  were  de-</span><span>  feated,  and  it  only  remained  for  their  antago-</span><span>  nists  to  put  forth  their  power  and  drive  them</span><span>  from  office.  The  Opposition  havo  lost  no  time</span><span>  in  makiug  manifest  their  intention.  On</span><span>  Wednesday,  when  the  House  met  and  was  con-</span><span>  stituted  by  Commission,  thc  first  business  to</span><span>  be  disposed  of  was  the  election  of  a  speaker.</span><span>  The  Government,  not  having  Mr.  King  within</span><span>  reach  to  recal  to  his  old  position,  proposed</span><span>  the  Senior  Member  for  the  Leichhardt,  Mr.</span><span>  John  Scott.  The  Opposition  proposed  Air  W.</span><span>  H.  Groom,  one  of  thc  members  for  Toowoomba.</span><span>  AgainBt  his  appointment  tbe  Premier  offered</span><span>  a  most  vigorous  protest.  He  expressed</span><span>  astonishment  at  Mr.  Griffith  having  the</span><span>  audacity  to  propose  as  President  of  the  House</span><span>  a  man  to  whom  the  judges  of  the  land  could</span></p> <p><span>  not  accord  the  full  liberties  of  a  free  citizen.</span></p> <p><span>  Other  members  were  equally  plain  spoken  in</span><span>  their  pretests,  but  on  a  division  the  appoint-</span><span>  ment  of  Mr.  Groom  was  carried  by  twenty</span><span>  nine  votes  to  seventeen.  To  emphasise  their</span><span>  objections  the  Ministry  proposed  a  member  of</span><span>  the  Opposition,  Mr.  Fraser,  but  the  solid</span><span>  phalanx  on  the  other  Bide  remained  unbroken,</span><span>  Mr.  Scott's  vote  alone  swelling  tho  minority.</span><span>  In  order  that  strangers  to  tho  colony  may</span><span>  undcrstaud  the  objection  to  Mr.  Groom,</span><span>  wo  may  explain  that  he  was  transported</span><span>  for  life  from  the  United  Kingdom  ;</span><span>  is  a  ticket  of  leave  man  ;  and,  report</span><span>  says,  has  boen  twico  convicted  of  crioio</span><span>  in  tlic  colonies.  At  the  general  election  in</span><span>  187S  he  was  returned  as  a  supporter  of  tho</span><span>  Conservative  party,  aud  when  tho  Douglas</span><span>  administration  was  ousted,  he  put  forward</span><span>  claims  to  office.  These  were  not  entertained</span><span>  whereupon  he  joined  thc  Opposition,  and  be-</span><span>  came  one  of  thc  most  influential  men  in  its</span><span>  ranks.  His  position  as  proprietor  ot'  the</span><span>  Toowoomba  Chronicle  baa  given  him  consider</span><span>  !  able  political  influence.  [Ie  has  alan  been</span></p> <p><span>  Mayor  of  thc  Municipality,  ami  in  that</span><span>  I  capacity  was  brought  iu  contact  with  the  late</span></p> <p><span>  I  Governor,  Kir  Arthur  Kennedy,  wlio  liai  a</span><span>  [  country  residence  near  Toowoomba.  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Groom  improved  his  opportunities,  embraced</span><span>  every  occasion  that  offered  to  flatter  tbc  vanity</span><span>  of  Sir  Arthur  Kennedy  and  his  daughter,</span><span>  and  had  his  name  associated  with  theirs.</span><span>  On  this  ground  it  is  possible  Mr.  Griffith</span><span>  may  arguo  that  society  haB  condoned  Mr.</span><span>  Groom's  offences,  but  an  astute  lawyer  should</span><span>  seo  that  the  Mayor  of  Toowoomba  is  au</span><span>  official  thc  Governor  could  not  cBoapo  recog-</span><span>  nising,  but  that  an  unforgiven  convict  is  quite</span><span>  a  different  person.  In  connection  with  tho</span><span>  election  of  Mr.  Groom  to  the  Speakership  of</span><span>  tho  Assembly,  we  would  recall  to  thc  minds</span><span>  of  our  readers  the  words  used  by  the  Leader  of</span><span>  the  Opposition  at  tho  Ipswich  banquet,</span><span>  ""They  (tho  Ministry)  had  exhibited  theiu</span><span>  eelves  to  tho  other  Australian  Colonies,  and  to</span><span>  tho  whole  world,  as  sotting  at  de6ance,  and</span><span>  trampling  under  foot  every  rule  that  was  in</span><span>  other  countries  laid  down  and  recognised,  be-</span><span>  cause  there  were  iu  politics,  as  in  private</span><span>  life,  certain  unwritten  mles  of  honour</span><span>  which  men  were  supposed  to  observe.""  We</span><span>  leave  it  to  our  readers  to  judge,  whether  tho</span><span>  gentleman  who  ottered  thcBC  words,  and</span><span>  those  who  supported  him,  in  thc  appointment</span><span>  of  a  convict  to  the  Speakership  of  thc  Legis-</span><span>  lative  Assembly,  have  not  only  set  at  defiance</span><span>  and  trampled  uuder  foot,  rules  of  honour</span><span>  recognised  in  other  countries,  but  have  offered</span><span>  an  insult  to  every  honest  man  in  this  colony.</span><span>  When  thc  Speaker  went  on  Thursday  to  be</span><span>  sworn  in  to  office  be  was  not  accompanied  by</span><span>  any  of  the  members  of  the  Ministerial  party.</span><span>  People  are  saying-What  will  they  think  of  us</span><span>  in  the  other  colonies?  But  wo  may  ask</span><span>  What  will  they  think  of  us  in  America  and</span><span>  Europe  1  What  will  they  think  of  ns  in  Eog</span><span>  :  laud  1  Indeed-what  will  they  think  of  us  in</span></p> <p><span>  China  1</span></p> <p><span>  A  REFERENCE  to  tho  division  liât  shows</span><span>  that  thc  vote  ia  tho  Assembly  on  Mr.  Groom's</span><span>  appointment  was  a  purely  party  ono.  Mem-</span><span>  bers  like  Mr.  Dutton  and  Mr.  Hurley,  who</span><span>  were  not  supposed  to  have  committed  them-</span><span>  selves  as  members  of  tho  Liberal  Party,  have</span><span>  formed  part  of  the  solid  phalanx.  This  shows</span><span>  the  decided  determination  of  tho  Iscador  of</span><span>  tlio  Opposition  that  Mr.  Groom  should  bo</span><span>  appointed.  It  also  shows  thc  influence</span></p> <p><span>  the  latter  has  obtained  in  thc  counsels  of  the</span><span>  Liberal  Party.  There  can  be  no  doubt  he</span><span>  enforced  his  claim  to  ofGcc,  if  not  by  what  be</span><span>  did  now,  hy  his  conduct  when  he  waa  refused</span><span>  office  before.  Had  he  boen  discarded  now  he</span><span>  might  not  have  had  tho  courage  to  go  back  to</span><span>  his  old  friends,  but  by  his  secession  he  would</span><span>  have  made  a  serious  breach  in  the  Liberal</span><span>  ranks.  The  inference  from  the  whole  proceed-</span><span>  ing  plainly  seoms  to  be  that  tho  Leader  of  the</span><span>  Opposition  is  prcparod  to  violate  thoBe</span><span>  unwritten  rules  of  honour,  to  which  he  so</span><span>  recently  called  our  attention,  rather  than  put</span><span>  in  peril  the  unanimity  of  his  party.</span></p> ",Article,1883-11-10,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

There  can</span><span>  be  little  doubt  among  the  unprejudiced  but</span><span>  what  the  completion  of  this  écheme  of  tho</span><span>  Premier's  would  place  Queensland  in  thc  front</span><span>  rank  of  the  Australian  colonies,  and  that  we</span><span>  should  soon  have  a  large  agricultural  and</span><span>  pastoral  population  located  in  the  interior,</span><span>  which,  by  means  of  the  great  arteries  of  com-</span><span>  merce,  the  railway  lines  wonld  cause  an</span><span>  immense  trade  to  spring  up  between  it  and</span><span>  the  principal  coastal  towns,  bringing  wealth</span><span>  and  prosperity  to  all.</span></p> <p><span>  Of  oourse,  that  partisan  journal,  the  Daily</span><span>  Northern  Argus,  gnashes  its  teeth  with  rage,</span><span>  now  that  it  sees  the  Premier  will,  at  the  next</span></p> <p><span>  meeting  of  Parliament,  be  able  to  place  before</span><span>  it  an  agreement  for  ratification,  which  is  cal-</span><span>  culated  to  confer  such  great  benefits</span></p> <p><span>  people  will  view  it  without  prejudice,  they</span><span>  must  acknowledge  this  grand  scheme</span><span>  of  the  Premier's,  will  advance  the  interests  of</span><span>  the  whole  people,  and  confirm  them  in  tho</span><span>  admitted  prosperity  which  they  uow  enjoy.</span><span>  The  completion  of  the  Transcontinental  line,</span><span>  with  the  ramification  of  the  branch  lines,  will</span><span>  be  the  crown  of  that  building,  the  foundations</span><span>  of  which  the  Premier  has  already  laid,  and</span><span>  will  raise  Queensland  into  a  powerful,  rich,</span><span>  and  populous  state  in  a  very  few  years.</span></p> <p><span>  But  this  policy  of  progress,  foresight,  and</span><span>  commou  sense,  has  set  your  contemporary  and</span><span>  thc  rest  of  the  so-called  Liberal  Press,  on  the</span><span>  rampage  again,  and  they  arc  venting  their</span><span>  splenetic  rage  in  efforts  of  vituperation  and</span><span>  disparagement.  Your  contemporary  would</span><span>  have  us  believe  that  an  imbecile  yielding  to</span><span>  the  implacable  howlers,  and  clamour  of  a</span><span>  clique,  is  constitutional  conduct-and  that  the</span><span>  firm  standing  by  the  constitution  ÍB  tyranny,</span><span>  sud  despotism.  But  I  in  no  way  identify  the</span><span>  matter  contained  in  the  leaders  of  the  Argus</span><span>  with  the  opinions  of  the  people.  It  is  simply</span><span>  the  organ  of  a  clique,  whose  object  is  to  pre-</span><span>  vent  the  advance  of  Rockhampton,  and  they</span><span>  muBt  hook  on  that  old  drag,  the</span><span>  Anjm,  to  thc  wheels  of  our  progress,</span></p> <p><span>  when  the  Brisbane  firm  of  Griffith  and</span></p> <p><span>  Co.  consider  our  pace  is  getting  too  fast.</span><span>  They  mean  not  only  to  check  tho  speed,  but</span><span>  to  place  obstructions  in  the  way  to  overturn</span><span>  thc  Rockhampton  coach.  When  I  bring  to</span><span>  mind  tlic  windings  and  thc  turnings  of  the</span><span>  A  rguK  upon  those  vital  questions  that  concern</span><span>  our  prosperity,  which  one  day  is  for  one  thing</span><span>  and  anuthcr  day  opposed  to  it  ;  I  am  induced</span><span>  to  exclaim-ls  it  possible,  the  utterances  of</span><span>  that  maudlin  paper  can  have  any  weight  with</span><span>  the  people  of  Rockhampton,  when  the  pros-</span><span>  perity  of  this  town  is  concerned  ?  Have  they</span><span>  not  marked  the  conduct  of  this  weakling  in</span><span>  our  camp  ?  It  may  be  that  they  are  blind  to</span><span>  thc  insiduous  assaults  of  the  Argiis  at  their</span><span>  best  interests,  and  require  thc  dust  to  bc</span><span>  wiped  from  their  eyes,  before  they  can  see</span><span>  clearly.</span></p> <p><span>  Then  let  us  examine  the  conduct  of  the</span><span>  Argus  upon  some  of  those  questions  that</span><span>  affect  our  welfare.  First,  we  will  take  the</span><span>  Port  Alma  railway.  On  this  question  the</span><span>  Argita  is  plainly  trying  to  thwart  the  project,</span></p> <p><span>  because  it  knows  it  would  benefit  Rock</span><span>  I  hampton,  end  therefore  it  gives  the  cnn  ,  il  nf</span></p> <p><span>  a  ""  Bushaia""  to  cause  disaster,  lt  takes  its</span></p> <p><span>  [  euc  from  Brisbane  politicians  ;  the  honourable</span></p> <p><span>  George  Thorn  for  instance,  who  bas  said</span></p> <p><span>  upon  tho  colony,  and</span></p> <p><span>  the</span></p> <p><span>  that  tbs  whistlo  of  the  first  locomotive  at</span><span>  Port  Algia  will  Bound  the  death,  knell</span><span>  of  Rockhampton,  when,  if  be  really  thought</span><span>  so,  he  wgnld  be,  the'first  to  recommend  the</span><span>  prosecution  of  the  railway.  But  the  .  knell</span></p> <p><span>  that  it  would  sound  would  bè  the  demise  of</span><span>  the  Brisbane  trade  with  tho  north,  and  that</span><span>  of  Brisbane  as  the  capital  of  the  colony.  That</span><span>  we  have  good  grounds  for  the  suspicion  that</span><span>  tho  Argus  is  playing  the  traitor,  the  following</span><span>  will  show  :-When  the  river  training  wall  was</span><span>  proposed  thc  Argua  had  leader  after  leader  in</span><span>  disparagement  of  it,  and  denounced  the  work</span><span>  aa  a  folly,  and  argued  in  favour  of  a  railway  ;</span><span>  but  now  when  we  have  the  opportunity  of</span><span>  both  deepening  our  river  and  getting  a  railway</span><span>  it  argues  against  a  railway  and  proposes  an</span><span>  absurdity  which  it  knows  will  never  be</span><span>  attempted,  and  sets  forth  the  advantages  of</span><span>  improving  our  river.  The  evident  object  ÍB  to</span><span>  cause  vacillation  in  onr  opinions,  and  to  baulk</span><span>  both  projects,  and  retard  the  improvements  to</span><span>  thc  approaches  of  our  town.</span></p> <p><span>  Again,  when  capital  from  Victoria  was</span><span>  being  introduced  into  our  western  country  the</span><span>  Argus  denounced  that.  Yet  no  one  will  now</span><span>  deny  thatourpresent  prosperity  ispartly  caused</span><span>  by  the  introduction  and  distribution  of  that</span><span>  capital  among  our  merchants  and  wage-earners.</span><span>  Again  when  our  Trunk  line  of  Railway  was</span><span>  proposed  to  bo  carried  out  due  west,  the</span><span>  Argun,  mindful  of  the  interest  of  the  Brisbane</span><span>  clique,  fought  hard  to  divert  us  from  our  pur-</span><span>  pose,  and  advocated  a  detour  through  Peak</span><span>  Downs  towards  Aramac.  Again,  how  stren-</span><span>  uously  it  has  worked,  and  is  working  to  prevent</span><span>  the  establishment  of  the  sugar  industry  in</span><span>  Rockhampton.</span></p> <p><span>  In  fact  when  one  comes  to  think  over  these</span><span>  things  it  is  plain  the  injury  Rockhampton  has</span><span>  sustained  through  the  evil  councils  of  the</span><span>  Argus  is  incalculable-But  the  nature  of  the</span><span>  disease  being  once  known  the  proper  remedies</span><span>  can  bo  applied.  Doubtless  the  Libearal  journals</span><span>  will  go  into  hysterics  of  joy  over  the  doings</span><span>  of  the  masses-how  easily  can  it  be  made</span><span>  ""  them  asses  ""-at  the  Towers,  who,  after</span><span>  being  thoroughly  humbugged-if  the  telegrams</span><span>  are  correct-harnessed  themselves  to  the</span><span>  carriage  of  their  idols,  Messrs.  Griffith  and</span><span>  Dickson,  apparently  without  the  slightest  con</span><span>  sciousneBs'.that  they  had  been  humbugged  and</span><span>  tho  degraded  and  ridiculous  position  they  were</span><span>  placing  themselves  in.  No  wonder  after  that</span><span>  exhibition  of  servility  by  the  working  mon  of</span><span>  Charters  Towers  thc  Argus,  while  commenting</span><span>  upon  the  Cingalese,  imply  that  £20  per  year</span><span>  with  rations  was  quite  good  enough  for  Euro-</span><span>  pean  labourers,  yet  most  of  them  who  dragged</span><span>  the  car  of  Mr,  Griffith  receive  from  £3  to  £4</span><span>  per  week.

"<p><span>  --rr---?---:</span></p> <p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  FRIDAY.  JANUARY  26,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  T#í  tendency  of  all  the""  colonies  to</span><span>  :  undertake  large  'monetary  responsibilities</span><span>  to  Erigtisfi  capitalists,has  lately  attracted</span><span>  the  attention  »f  both  the  .  English  and</span><span>  -'Colonial  Press,  and  it  certainly  seems  to</span><span>  be  the.  general  opinion  that  the  colonies1</span><span>  bave,  one  and'  all,  been  ^contracting</span></p> <p><span>  National  Debts  on  mach  too  extensive</span><span>  i'a  scale.  In  countries,  where  indirect</span><span>  taxákion  is  ari  institution,  and  direct</span><span>  taxation;'totally  abolished,  the  majority</span><span>  of  people  do  not  realise  at  first  how</span><span>  heavily  the  liability  presses  on  them  which</span><span>  takes  ?  their  revenue  to  pay  interest</span><span>  merely  while  the  great  National  responsi-</span></p> <p><span>  bility  goes  ion  increasing.  Of  course,  in  -</span><span>  'young  countries  where  a  large  revenue  is</span></p> <p><span>  ?obtained.  from  the  sale.oï  Crown  lands,</span><span>  and  wjjerp  '.  taxation  is  comparatively</span><span>  light,  the  payment  of  interest  on  loans</span><span>  does  not  press  inconveniently,  but  it</span></p> <p><span>  must  be  botne  in  mind  that  the  colonies</span></p> <p><span>  are  every  year  parting  with  the  public</span></p> <p><span>  estate.  This  means  that  the  assets  of</span></p> <p><span>  every  colony  '  are  becoming  lessened,</span><span>  while  their  liabilities  are  steadily  in-</span><span>  creasing.  In  answer  to  such  objection  it</span><span>  is  only  fair  to  say  that  those  who  favour</span></p> <p><span>  this  state  that  if  the  Crown  lands  be</span></p> <p><span>  passing  but,  of  the  hands  of,the  Govern-</span><span>  ment,  that  public  works  of  a  remunera-</span><span>  tive  order  are  being  constructed,  and</span><span>  that  the  assets  are  therefore  not  melting</span><span>  away.  It  is  further  argued  that  a  great</span><span>  portion  of  the  money  realised  (rom  the</span><span>  sale  of  Crown  lands  is  expended  in  rail-</span><span>  way'construction^  and  that  every  mile  of</span><span>  railway  increases  the  value  of  land  in  its</span><span>  vicinity  almost  double.  This  last  argu-</span><span>  ment  may  be  readily  disposed  of  by</span><span>  slating  that  before  the  government  land</span><span>  has  a.  chance  to  rise  in  value  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  /approach-of  a  railway  line,  it  is  bought</span><span>  up  at  cheap  rates,  so  that  when  the  rail-</span><span>  way  enhances  its  value  it  does  so  for  the</span><span>  benefit  of  some  private  person,  not  for  the</span><span>  government  of  the  country.  Also,  land</span><span>  is  allowed  by  the  government  gene-</span><span>  rally  to'  be  '  so  Surveyed  that  the</span><span>  cream  of  it  is  picked  out,:  and</span><span>  the  unpurchased  lots  left  in  unsale-</span><span>  able  shapes  or  positions,  thus  securing</span><span>  them  to  a  certain  purchaser  at  his  own</span><span>  price.  From  this  it  may  fairly  be  said</span><span>  that  the  Government  do  not  reap  much</span><span>  benefit  from  railway  construction,  so  far</span><span>  as  it  enhances  the  value  of  land.  As</span><span>  to  the  other  statement,  it  must  be</span><span>  remembered  that  all  thc  public  works</span><span>  obtained  in  exchange  for  the  lands</span><span>  require  a  considerable  outlay  to  .keep</span><span>  them  in  working  order,  that  many  of</span></p> <p><span>  them  are  not  remunerative-such  as</span></p> <p><span>  costly  public  buildings,  and  the  improve-</span><span>  ments  of  parks,  gardens,  and  public</span><span>  luns-and  that  some  of  them  actually</span><span>  entail  a  loss  upon  the  country  yearly,  to</span><span>  keep  serviceable-roads  and  bridges  are</span><span>  of  this  class.  There  can  be  no  question</span><span>  whatever;  that  the  policy  now  pursued</span><span>  by  several  of  the  Colonies  simply</span><span>  amounts  to  lessening  the  assets,  and</span><span>  increasing  the  liabilities  ;  and  any  busi-</span><span>  ness  man  knows  bow  that  ends,  sooner</span><span>  or  later,  in  private  affairs.  National</span><span>  insolvency,  is  of  course,  almost  impos-</span><span>  sible,  for  if  the  country  that  has  taken</span><span>  up  loans  to  another  nation  cannot  pet  its</span><span>  interest,  it  seizes  the  revenue,  even  by</span><span>  force  of  arms,  and  increases  taxation</span><span>  until  the  liability  is  met.  Such  pro</span><span>  cedings  generally  result  in  bloodshed,</span><span>  revolution,  and  wide  spread  misery.</span></p> <p><span>  About  a  fortnight  ago  Sir  William</span><span>  Jervois,  the  Ute  Governor  of  South</span><span>  Australia,  took  occasion  in  bring-</span><span>  ing  to  a  close  his  successful  term  of</span><span>  service  as  regal  representative  in  that</span></p> <p><span>  Colony,,  to  bpftu  out  the  danger  of</span><span>  South  j(ustrau^""  continuing  to  increase</span><span>  nts  monetary  responsibilities.  He  pointed</span><span>  out  that  the  lofDs  raised  and  authorised</span><span>  by  that  Colony  atfJtHint  to  ¿£14,000,000</span><span>  sterling,  and  ¡that  Vie  Colony  only</span><span>  has  290,000  inhabitants  who  are  the</span><span>  conjoint  debtors  for  that  amount.</span></p> <p><span>  This  really  means  that,  «very  resident  ip  &lt;</span><span>  South  Australia  is  a  debtor  to  the  extentJ</span><span>  of  over  ¿£48,  As  one  half,  .the,  popula-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  are  not  worth  anything  like  this  sum  ?</span><span>  it  practically  amounts  to  a  liability  of</span><span>  ¿£96  on  195,000  i  people;  1  :  In  fact</span><span>  beyond  question  a,  debt  of  ¿£14,000,000</span><span>  nj  a  country  of  290,000  inhabitants,  is  a</span></p> <p><span>  very  tidy  sum  no  matter  how  you  look  1</span><span>  at  it.  Referring  to  this  .  conditionof  3</span><span>  affairs  Sir  William  says  :  -  If  it  si?  1</span></p> <p><span>  happened  that  there  'should  come.j</span><span>  together  a  shortness  of  money  here,  bad</span><span>  seasons,  and  perhaps  financial  tightness</span><span>  in  London-events  whithl  venture,  tflf</span><span>  say  may  be  regarded  as:  pqssjbjlittes-r</span><span>  the  crisis  here  would  be  ^seriously</span><span>  aggravated,  and  all  would  suffer.  The</span><span>  working  nun,  the  propertied  class  alike</span><span>  would  feel  it,  and  all  are  interested  in</span><span>  putting  the  finances  of  the  colony  in  the</span><span>  proper  position  to  resist  any  such  strain.""</span><span>  His  Excellency  then  went  on  to  show</span><span>  that  the  proper  way  «.  ease  the  strain-  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  debt  was  to  add  to  the  population.  J</span><span>  ,""I  know""  .he,  sáid,  '  ""ther£""',ï?,.';an  |</span><span>  idea,  prevailing  very  often  on  the  part</span><span>  of  the  working  men,  -  that  '  immigra-</span><span>  tion  will  do  .  them.  harm,  ,  and</span><span>  that  high  wages  mean,  .great,  .employ-</span><span>  ment  ;.  but  that  is,  not  the  catie,  geode</span><span>  men,  as  you  all  know.:  You  -may  have</span><span>  more  wages  and  inoré  employment  with</span><span>  a  large  population,  and  less  wages  and.</span><span>  less  employment  with  a  small  popula-'</span><span>  'lion.  I  do  not  propose  immigration</span><span>  with  a  view""  of  reducing'  wagés/bùl  I</span><span>  propose  it  in  the  interest  of  all.  Immi-</span><span>  gration  would  help  to  pay  the  interest,</span><span>  on  your  debt,  and  what  is  more,  looking</span><span>  at  it  from  a  working  man's'  standpoint,</span></p> <p><span>  it  would  Vender  necessary  rppre  jhöuses,.</span></p> <p><span>  and  give  more  employment  for  builders,</span><span>  clothiers,  shoemakers,  and  more  employ-</span><span>  ment  all  round  ;  and,  of  '  course;  would</span><span>  improve  the  market  for  farmers'  produce,,</span><span>  and  promote  settlement.""  These  first</span><span>  class  .  utterances  simply  mean  this:</span><span>  Stop  borrowing  and  increase  the  num-.</span><span>  tier  of  settlers  in  the  country.  Then,  if</span><span>  we  cease  borrowing  how  can  we</span><span>  construct  great  railways-why  they</span><span>  would  have  to  .remain,  unbuilt  for  ages</span><span>  at  this  rate.  There  is  one  way  out</span><span>  of  the  dilemma-construct  railways  on</span><span>  the  land-grant  principle,  and  thus  cease""</span><span>  increasing  the  national  liability,  and</span><span>  lessen  the  burden  of  that  already  in-</span><span>  curred  by  increasing  the  number  of</span></p> <p><span>  colonists.  ?</span></p> <p><span>  This  subject  can  hardly  be  left  with-</span><span>  out  noting,  the  great  disinclination  in</span><span>  some  quarters  to  bear  the  naked  truth.</span><span>  We  put  it  plainly  and.  unmistakably  that</span></p> <p><span>  the  borrowing  powers  :  of  the  colonies,,</span><span>  have  been  overstrained.  When  this  is</span><span>  said,  it  does  not  mean  that  financial  ruin</span><span>  is  staring  us  in  the  face;  it  does  ,not.</span><span>  mean  that  We  shall  never  again  be  able</span><span>  .to  borrow  money  in  the  English  market;</span><span>  but  it  does  mean  that  it  is  our  duty  to</span><span>  carefully  watch  our  liabilities,  and  see</span><span>  that  they  do  not  increase  inordinately,</span><span>  while  our  assets  are  diminishing.  .  The</span><span>  liability  of  this  Colony  amounts  at  present</span><span>  to  about  ¿£  13,245,150,  âtid  the  popula-</span><span>  tion  is  put  down  at  227,000!  Thus  we</span><span>  have  a  liability  amounting  td  ^58  per</span></p> <p><span>  bead,  on  each  resident;  .  Since:  the</span><span>  returns  ort  which  this  is  based  were</span><span>  made  up,  immigration  has  increased  the</span><span>  population,  and  so  reduced  the  debt  per</span><span>  head  to  slightly  less  ;,  but  this  is  quite</span><span>  too  much  liability.  It  may  not  be  too</span><span>  muchif  we  go  on  addingtoourpopulatiori,</span><span>  and  .  not  ¡  adding  to  our,  .debt.  The</span><span>  people  in  the  country  must  have  food</span><span>  and  clothes,  and  revenue  can'  be</span><span>  obtained  from  them  indirectly  by  taxing</span><span>  these,  so  that  when  the  population  has></span><span>  increased  so  as  to  ensure  a  revenue</span></p> <p><span>  proper,  .  sufficient  to  pay  ?  interest  oh  1</span><span>  borrowed  capital,  and  Carry  on  the</span><span>  government,  of  the  country,  we  may</span><span>  again  borrow  capital  if  necessary.</span><span>  The  interest  at  4  per  cent  on  :the</span></p> <p><span>  ¿£13,245,150  borrowed  amounts  to  t</span><span>  '¿£529,806,.^  annum,  and  the  revenue  '</span><span>  being  ¿£2,023,668  for  1881-2  there  is</span><span>  left  for  the  carrying  on  of  the  govern-</span><span>  ment  of  the  country,  the  maintenance  of</span><span>  non-remunerative  worjes,  charitable</span><span>  institutions,  penal  establishments,  &c,</span><span>  ¿£1,493,862.  When  it  is  taken  into</span><span>  considerâtion  that  one-fourth  of  the</span><span>  reveriue-¿£2,023,668-  is  derived  from</span><span>  land  sales,  and  we  deduct  thjs  irom  it,</span><span>  we  get  the  revenue  proper  at  £1,517,742.</span><span>  and;  taking  from  this  the  interest  to  be</span><span>  yearly  paid,  the  case  looks  worse,  for</span><span>  we  only  have  ¿£987,936  to  carry  on</span><span>  with  yearly.  Then  it  must  be  borne  in</span><span>  mind  that  bad  seasons  would  materially</span><span>  affect  our  revenue  should  thpy  happen,</span><span>  that  is  there  would  be  a  less  consumption</span><span>  of  dutiable  articles  if  money  became</span><span>  scarce.  So  that  it  simply  amounts'to</span><span>  this  :  we  would  have  barely  enough</span><span>  revenue  for  the  requirements  of  the</span><span>  colony  if  we  laid  out  our,  land  revenue</span><span>  in  permanent  works-as  we  should</span><span>  even  supposing  seasons  of  prosperity</span><span>  succeeded  each  other  regularly.  Let</span><span>  one  season  of  a  disastrous  nature</span><span>  overtake  us  and  we  should  imme-</span></p> <p><span>  diately  feel  the  weight  of  our  self  im-</span><span>  posed  burden  of  national  debt.  This</span><span>  would  necessitate  increased  taxation.</span><span>  Plainly,  therefore,  our  policy  should</span><span>  be  increase  the  population,  and  let</span><span>  borrowing  alone,  until  we  have  secured</span><span>  a  revenue  proper,  that  will  pay  interest</span><span>  on  the  national  debt,  and  defray  thc</span><span>  cost  of  government,  making  allowance</span><span>  for  all  possible  contingencies.  This  is</span><span>  a  safe  course,  and  will  be  found  in  the</span><span>  long  run  among  the  surest  roads  to  lasiing</span><span>  prosperity.</span></p> <p><span>  A  SUSSE  of  duty  to  tho  ratepayers  of  the</span><span>  Municipality  induces  us  to  call  attcntiôu  to</span><span>  what  we  regard  ns  culpublo  carelessness  in  tho</span><span>  conducting  of  tho  recent  municipal  election.</span><span>  Clause  7b*  of  the  Local  Government  Act  pro-</span><span>  vides-""No  person  who  acts  os  returning</span><span>  officer  at  any  election,  shall  be  or  become  a</span><span>  candidate  for  arjy  offico  at  such  election.""</span><span>  The  public  notices  of  the  election  were  issued</span><span>  on  the  12th  instant  signed  by  Mr.  Sharples  as</span><span>  Returning  Officer  ;  and  they  continued  to</span></p> <p><span>  austin  .this  JfortMie  ptffV  HU  tbs  2*4</span><span>  faltan»  IMO  nflfcje  oft«  elecjjfcn  Wu  tjfaedny</span><span>  jyJerBttn  WifclnsÄ  who  «Med  as  jjffurrfgg</span></p> <p><span>  yloottçn,  Ala*man^hn,rpläfiouldVot  issue</span><span>  ^njuíiptioe  as  retarniog  o'fficer  ;  ño  other</span><span>  pdcipe  was  ÎBBued  than  his  informal  one  ;  and,</span><span>  it  is  a  question,  therefore,  whether  the  rate-</span><span>  payers  having  received  no  proper  notice,  the</span></p> <p><span>  instant,  attention  was  called  to  the,fact  that</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Sharples.  ,  he}ni.'fl  candida^</span></p> <p><span>  aot  aa  '  rettlrnlng  officer,  'and  Alderman  .</span><span>  Sumner  was  appointed.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>  THURSDAY.  FEBRUARY  8,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  WITH  their  rapidly  growing  wealth  the</span><span>  Australian  Colonies  are  also  increasing</span><span>  their  responsibilities,  and  it  is  somewhat</span><span>  remarkable  how  very  few  among  the</span><span>  colonists  realise  that  the  increase  of</span><span>  wealth  necessitates  the  institution  of</span><span>  measures  for  its  protection.  The  man</span><span>  who  becomes  possessed  of  property  in  a</span><span>  community  readily  grasps  the  idea  that,</span><span>  a  police  force,  and  strong  locks  and</span><span>  bolts  are  unmistakeable  requisites,  but</span><span>  when  the  same  principle  is  involved  in</span><span>  international  policy  he  fails  to  appreciate</span></p> <p><span>  it  to  the  full  extent.  The  total  revenue</span><span>  of  the  Australian  Colonies  and  New</span><span>  Zealand  for  the  year  1881  was</span><span>  ¿£21,608,000,  and  when  it  is  known  that</span><span>  such  a  vast  sum  can  annually  be</span><span>  collected  in  taxes  a  very  fair  idea  may  be</span><span>  formed  of  the  enormous  wealth  that  has</span><span>  been  accumulated  on  our  shores.  The</span><span>  contemplation  of  this  treasure  should  be</span><span>  enougli  to  attract  the  attention  of  per-</span><span>  sons  of  marauding  tendencies,  and</span><span>  should  occasion  arise  such  would  un-</span><span>  doubtedly  tum  their  attention  to  our</span><span>  condition.  The  only  cause  for  the</span><span>  colonists  to  fear  that  might  bring</span><span>  about  a  visit  from  an  armed  force,</span><span>  would  be  the  fact  of  England  becoming</span><span>  involved  in  a  European  struggle-a  con-</span><span>  tingency  not  by  any  means  so  remote  as</span><span>  the  majority  of  Australians  seem  to</span><span>  think.  The  Eastern  Question  has  not</span><span>  yet  been  settled.  The  difficulties  con-</span><span>  nected  with  it  still  remain  unsolved,  and</span><span>  it  is  not  improbable  that  the  highway  of  the</span><span>  world-Suez-will  at  no  very  distant  date</span><span>  be  the  battle  ground  on  which  Ute  Mussul-</span><span>  man  and  the  Christian  will  fight  out</span><span>  their  deadly  jealousy  and  national  hatred.</span><span>  To  .those  who  are  unacquainted  with  the</span><span>  nations  under  Mahometan  rule,  it  is</span><span>  difficult  to  convey  even  a  faint  idea  of</span><span>  the  intense  detestation  in  which  the  mad</span><span>  fanatical  worshippers  of  Allah  hold</span><span>  the  usurping  infidel.  This  feeling  is</span><span>  unquestionably  fostered  secretly  by</span><span>  nations  whose  interest  in  the  East  render</span><span>  English  supremacy  in  that  quarter  cause</span><span>  for  envy,  and  doubtless  the  intrigues</span><span>  will  yet  be  unmasked,  and  the  bayonet</span><span>  drawn  in  a  decisive  struggle  oh  the</span><span>  shores  of  the  Levant.  Whether  this</span><span>  will  occur  in  our  time  or  not,  none  can</span><span>  foretell  ;  but  that,  according  to  the  law</span><span>  of  the  survival  of  the  fittest,  one  of  the</span><span>  two  races  must  eventually  obliterate  the</span><span>  other,  or  so  crush  it  that  the  remnant</span><span>  shall  be  absorbed,  and  thus  its  indi-</span><span>  viduality  lost,  is  rendered  certain  by</span><span>  the  experience  of  Universal  history.  If</span><span>  this  be  so,  it  has  yet  to  be  decided  who</span><span>  shall  hold  Western  and  Central  Asia,</span><span>  and  though  it  is  always  hazardous  to</span><span>  prophesy,  we  may  indulge  in  it  vaguely</span></p> <p><span>  decide  who  shall  hold  Suez,  and  who</span><span>  own  India.  When  that  time  comes,</span><span>  Australia  may  find  herself  first  honoured</span><span>  by  a  visit  from  an  armed  force.</span></p> <p><span>  In  the  consideration  of  this  contin-</span><span>  gency  two  questions  present  themselves  :</span><span>  firstly,  when  will  the  occasion  be  likely  to</span><span>  arise,  and  secondly,  what  would  be  the</span><span>  nature  of  the  force  likely  to  be  dis-</span><span>  patched  against  us.  These  two  questions</span><span>  must  be  satisfactorily  settled  before  any</span><span>  system  of  defence  can  be  attempted.</span><span>  With  regard  to  the  first  it  is  simply  a</span><span>  matter  of  conjecture,  but  it  may  be  re-</span><span>  marked  that  the  safe  side  is  to  be  ready</span><span>  for  it,  no  matter  how  soon  the  dire</span><span>  necessity  may  arise.  As  to  what  force</span><span>  would  operate  against  us  ;  there  can  be</span><span>  hardly  any  doubt  we  would  be  visited  by</span><span>  fast  steam  vessels,  carrying  heavy  guns,,</span><span>  and  containing  a  force  sufficiently  large</span><span>  to  overcome  süch  troops  as  might  reason-</span><span>  ably  be  expected  to  meet  them  iii  our</span><span>  largest  centres  of  population.:  Where</span><span>  these  centres  are,  like  Brisbane,  Sydney,</span><span>  and  other  coast  towns-the  invading</span><span>  force  could  approach  within  a  distance</span><span>  from  which  they  could  shell  the  cities.</span><span>  In  other  cases,  where  there  would  be  a</span><span>  distance  inland  to  traverse,  troops  would</span><span>  have  to  be  landed.</span></p> <p><span>  In  endeavouring  to  protect  ourselves</span><span>  from  such  dangers  as  would  threaten</span><span>  it  must  be  clear  that  the  one</span><span>  grand  object  to  be  attained  is  united</span><span>  action  between  the  colonies  to  pre-</span><span>  vent  the  landing  of  an  invading  force,1</span><span>  and,  secondly,  individual  action  in  the</span><span>  various  coastal  cities  to  prevent  them</span><span>  being  bombarded.  Taking  the  latter</span><span>  necessity  first  it  may  be  remarked  that</span><span>  the  bombardment  of  Alexandria  has</span><span>  clearly  shown  that  land  fortifications</span><span>  cannot  resist  the  naval  engines  of  war</span><span>  which  can  be  brought  against  them.</span><span>  Alexandria  was  a  remarkably  strongly</span><span>  lortified  position.  There  is  no  city  on</span><span>  the  Atlantic  coast  of  America  fortified  as</span><span>  effectively  as  Alexandria  was,  and  our</span><span>  American  cousins  have  not  been  a  little</span><span>  surprised  at  the  ease  with  which  Admiral</span><span>  Seymour  battered  down  tremendous</span><span>  works,  sheltering  guns  heavy  enough,  it</span><span>  was  supposed,  to  prove  destructive  to</span><span>  almost  anything  afloat.  Realising  this,</span><span>  the  next  question  is  whether  torpedoes</span><span>  could  be  used  to  protect  harbours  against</span><span>  a  naval  enemy.  Torpedo  warfare,  how-</span><span>  ever,  has  not  yet  been  scientifically</span><span>  worked  out-or  rather  the  science  of  it</span><span>  has  not  been.  practically  demonstrated.</span><span>  There  is  one  peculiarity  at  present  in  the</span><span>  science  that  these  frightful  engines  of</span><span>  war  are  as  dangerous  to  those  who  use</span><span>  them  as  to  the  enemy  against  whom  they</span><span>  are  employed-that  is  unless  they  are</span><span>  fixed  in  position  before  being  exploded.</span><span>  Now  if  a  system  of  fixed  submarine</span><span>  torpedoes  were  instituted  it  would  be</span><span>  necessary  for  the  approaching  vessels  to</span><span>  pass  directly  over  them,  and  except  in</span><span>  the  case  of  their  having  lo  navigate  a</span><span>  narrow  channel  thc  awful  possibility  of</span><span>  their  missing  them  is  too  serious  to  con-</span><span>  template,  Again,  where  a  narrow</span><span>  channel  is  found  the  enemy  can  explode</span></p> <p><span>  îhe  .torpedoes  ^themselves  before  ¡their  :</span><span>  vessels  apffoxb.  The!  commanders,  ¡</span><span>  knowing  tty  fhfcrts  that  4  barrow  channel  I</span><span>  h^o.be  ^s«,>ould^lear  jt  of  jíxed</span><span>  torpedoes  for  a  start.  In  the  meantime</span><span>  ttis  at  least  advisable  to  realise  that  one</span><span>  good  turret  ship-a  first-class  steam  ram</span><span>  mounting  say  one  eighty-one  ton  gun</span></p> <p><span>  ftfquWL  be  «ore:  effective  tHào  anything'  ;</span><span>  else  in  preventing,  such  vessels  as  could</span><span>  safely  -make  the  voyage  to  Australia  from</span><span>  approaching  within  shelling  distance  of  a</span></p> <p><span>  coastal  city.  ""</span></p> <p><span>  With  regard-to  the  establishment  of  a</span><span>  land  force  our  real  safety  lies  in</span><span>  railway  construction.  If  the  largest</span><span>  cities  of  Australia  were  all  connected  by</span></p> <p><span>  railway,  troops  could  be  massed  at  any  ?</span><span>  point  of  the  coast  in  sufficient  ;  numbers  ;</span><span>  to  defy  any  army  that  could  ever  land.  :</span><span>  Local  forces  could  keep  the  enemy  in</span><span>  check  and  harass  their  landing,  while</span><span>  the  forces  were  being  centred  in.  the</span><span>  town  which  it  was  the  object,  of  the</span><span>  enemy  to  attack.  Thus  the  secret  of</span><span>  security  lies  in  railway  construction,  but</span><span>  a  secondary  point  is  the  necessity  of</span><span>  training  the  colonists  to  the  use  of  arms,,</span></p> <p><span>  and  in  a  scattered  population  ?  this  is  no  1</span><span>  simple  task.  Our  volunteer  system,  no</span><span>  doubt,  in  time,  will  be  come  effective,  as  a'</span><span>  nucleus  of  trained  '  men  around,  which</span><span>  the  inhabitants  would  assemble,  but</span><span>  these  inhabitants  themselves  must  be,  to&lt;</span><span>  a  certain  degree,  trained  to  be  effective.</span><span>  This  difficulty  would,  perhaps,  be  most</span><span>  easily  overcome  by  training  all  the  boys</span><span>  in  the  country  while  at  school  to  the  use</span><span>  of  arms.  If  every  public  school  had</span><span>  its  cadet  corps,  the  boys  in  after</span><span>  years  would,  at  all  events,  remember</span><span>  sufficient  in  manhood  to  be  useful  as  an</span></p> <p><span>  auxiliary  in  time  of  war.  Lessons</span></p> <p><span>  I  ¿aa;  ttèyw  childhood,  especially  lessons</span></p> <p><span>  oàjt  j^ects  of  interest,  are  not  easily</span><span>  forgotten,  and  boys  learn  drill  and  the</span><span>  use  of  aims,  as  Teadily  as  '  they  do</span><span>  cricket  and  marbles.  The  safety  of</span><span>  Australia  in  the  future  will  depend  not  a</span><span>  little  upon  the  training  of  the  boys  of</span><span>  to-day,  and  this  is  a  part  of  education</span><span>  at  present  totally  neglected  in  Queens-</span><span>  land'and  South  Australia.  Victoria  and</span><span>  New  South  Wales  are  not  so  in-</span><span>  different  on  the  subject.  In  con-</span><span>  clusion  it  may  be  observed  that  it</span><span>  is  gratifying  to  notice  in  Rockhampton</span><span>  that  there  is  a  spirit  shown  by  the  young</span><span>  mea  in  favour  of  volunteer  duty,  of</span><span>  which  we  have  occasion  to  be  proud,</span></p> <p><span>  and  the  fact  is  noticed  in  both  Brisbane</span><span>  and  northern  towns,  judging  from  the</span><span>  articles  appearing  in  our  exchanges.</span><span>  We  hope  that  this  patriotic  spirit  will</span><span>  continue  to  operate,  and  that  all  the</span><span>  residents  will  do  their  utmost  to</span><span>  encourage  it,  fpr  we  know  not  how  soon</span><span>  it  may  save  both  our  lives  and  property.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  naws  by  cable  thia  week  convoys  the</span><span>  pleasing  intelligence  that  it  is  extremely  pro-</span><span>  bable  the  dastardly  ruffians  who  murdered</span><span>  Lord  Frederick  Cavendish  ¡and'Mr.  Burke  in</span><span>  the  Phoenix  Park,  Dublin,  have  at  last  been</span><span>  unearthed.  At  first  the  chargo  against  the</span><span>  accusoi  was  ridiculed  by  their  counsel,  but  SB</span><span>  the  case  proceeded  revelations  were  made</span><span>  which  brought  the  guilt  pretty  well  home</span><span>  to  the  prisoners.  The  mystery  that  has</span><span>  surrounded  this  diabolical  outrage  since  its</span><span>  perpetration  has  been  almost  an  incentivo  to</span></p> <p><span>  Slender  'cTÍrnraáitíy""  °tMP*JgA&J8$?  &</span></p> <p><span>  criminals.  Again,  tho  apparent  utter  in-</span><span>  ability  of  the  English  and  Irish  Detective</span><span>  Folios  Forces  to.obtoiu  the  slightest  clue  to  the</span><span>  whereabouts  of  these  bloodthirsty  eaoundrcls</span><span>  proved  the  alarming  and  humiliating  fact</span><span>  that  there  were  actually  residents  in  Ireland,</span><span>  who  would  shelter  the  most  criminal  offenders</span><span>  conceivable,  It  is  also  gratifying  to  learn</span><span>  that  the  murderous  assassin  who  attempted</span><span>  tho  life  of  the  juryman  Field,  in  the  streets</span><span>  of  Dublin,  on  the  27th  of  last  November,  has</span><span>  been  identified,  It  will  be  remembered  that</span><span>  Mr.  Field  was  returning  to  his  home  after</span><span>  having  performed  his  duties  as  a  juryman  on</span><span>  tbe  date  mentioned,  when  three  men  drove  up</span><span>  alongside  him  in  a  car.  One  of  these  sprang</span><span>  out,  stabbed  Mr.  Field  several  times  with  a</span><span>  sword,  sprang  again  into  the  car,  and  waa</span><span>  driven  away.  -  {Cavanagh  the  driver  of  the</span><span>  car  has  been  .identified.  We  can  only  hope</span><span>  that  tbe  detection  of  crime  may  be  evidence</span><span>  that  there  ia  not  so  much  feeling  in  Ireland</span><span>  antagonistic  to  law  and  order  as  waa  painfnlly</span><span>  oyident.some  time  since.  When  Ireland  ceases</span><span>  to  conceal  blood-thirsty  assassins  she  may</span><span>  hope  for  justice  and  prosperity-but  not  till</span><span>  then.  ..  ^  ?</span></p> <p><span>  Till!  frequent  arrival  on  our  chores  of</span><span>  criminals  who  have  made  their  escape  from</span><span>  tMe  french  penal  establishment,'  cu  the  island</span><span>  of  New  Caledonia,  baa  led.  us  to  consider</span><span>  which  is  the  best  method  to  adopt  in  the</span><span>  treatment  of  thees  escapees.  It  will  be  at</span><span>  once  apparent  that  the  introduction  of  the</span><span>  criminal  element  of  France,  icto  this  country</span><span>  is  not  '  only  objectionable  but  extremely</span><span>  dangerous,  sod  therefore  we  have  a  right  to</span><span>  {irotect  ourselves  from  the  unpleasantness  of</span></p> <p><span>  laving  this  class  of  foreiguer  at  large  in  our</span><span>  dominion.  But  it  is  impossible  for  any  one</span><span>  not  to  feel  some  sympathy  with  such  daring</span><span>  adventurers  as  these  men  are,  who  risk  their</span><span>  lives  in  order  to  gaiu  their  freedom.  In  many</span><span>  instances  unfortunate  men  have  been  banished</span><span>  to  New  Caledonia,  for  merely  political  offences</span><span>  -they  been  made  criminals  becauso  they</span><span>  were  unsuccessful  reformers.  No  doubt  in</span><span>  the  interests  of  civilization,  their  punishment</span><span>  may  be  an  absolute  necessity.  Still  none  the</span><span>  less,  the  picture  of  their  struggling  for  days  lo</span><span>  open  boats,  without  compass  or  chart,  without</span><span>  proper  ?  food,  and  no  wator,  while  every.</span><span>  moment  they  have  to  bale  for  bare  life-the</span><span>  contemplation  of  all  this  endured  bravely</span><span>  and  cheerfully,  only  to  be  rewarded  with</span><span>  imprisonment  on  reaching  our  Australian</span><span>  coast,  causes  a  shock  to  all  those  feelings</span><span>  which  prompt  human  nature  to  succour  the</span><span>  distressed.  The  police  authorities  in  tin's</span><span>  colony  proceed  under  the  Vagrant  Act  against</span><span>  these  refugees,  clearly  not  becauso  they  are</span><span>  6011a  fide  vagrants,  but  merely  as  an  excuse</span><span>  for  remanding  them  fromtimcto  time  until  they</span><span>  oan  be  handed  over  to  the  French  authorities.</span><span>  However  expedient  such  a  course  may  be,  it</span><span>  is  hardly  redolent  of  that  fair  play  English-</span></p> <p><span>  men  boast  so  much  about,</span></p> <p><span>  THE  Keilawarra,  i.s.,  which  arrived  hereon</span><span>  Tuesday  evening,  brought  a  fiue  black  colt,  ft</span><span>  yearling,  from  Sydnoy.

"<p><span>  KOCKIIAMI'TON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  FEBRUARY  20,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  AMONG  the  rural  industries,  which  in</span><span>  time  will  give  pleasant  and  profitable</span><span>  employment  to  a  large  number  of  our</span><span>  colonists,  none  can  be  looked  forward  to</span><span>  more  hopefully  than  fruit  culture.  Gar-</span><span>  dening  was  one  of  man's  first  pursuits,</span><span>  and  he  seems  to  incline  to  it  from  here-</span><span>  ditary  disposition.  City  life  never</span><span>  possesses  the  freshness  and  charm  of</span><span>  work  among  springing  plants  and  blos-</span><span>  soming  trees.  Enjoyment  sweetens  toil</span><span>  to  the  husbandman,  who  expectant</span><span>  waits  the  green  blades  coming  through</span><span>  the  brown  earth,  watches  their  progress</span><span>  to  maturity,  and  with  rejoicing,  in  the</span><span>  ingathering,  reaps  the  reward  of  his</span><span>  labours,  and  realises  his  hopes.  The</span><span>  majority  of  men,  unless  constrained  by</span><span>  circumstances,  would  adopt  agriculture,</span><span>  or  her  more  engaging  sister,  horticulture,</span><span>  as  a  profession.  In  Queensland,  besides</span><span>  its  natural  attractions,  the  occupation  is</span><span>  held  to  possess  the  more  powerful  one</span><span>  of  profit.  Only  a  little  energy  and</span><span>  capital,  it  is  concluded,  are  required  to</span><span>  make  it  a  means  of  affording  remunera-</span><span>  tive  employment  to  a  large  number  of</span><span>  colonists.  The  manner  in  which  this</span><span>  may  be  done,  in  the  first  instance  at</span><span>  least,  is  not  by  the  establishment  of</span><span>  fruit  farms,  but  by  the  erection  and</span><span>  operation  of  fruit  preserving'  works.  It</span><span>  is  evident,  however,  that  the  formation</span><span>  of  the  latter  must  succeed  the  former</span><span>  at  least  to  some  extent.  Without  ample</span><span>  supplies  of  fruits  the  works  would  be</span><span>  useless  :  employment  for  them  there</span><span>  would  be  none.  On  the  other  hand,</span><span>  until  works  are  erected,  and  the  growers</span><span>  can  secure  a  ready  and  permanent  outlet</span><span>  for  their  produce,  they  cannot  be  ex-</span><span>  pected  to  expend  labour  and  land  on</span></p> <p><span>  fruit  culture.</span></p> <p><span>  From  the  columns  of  a  South  Austra-</span><span>  lian  contemporary  we  glean  some</span><span>  interesting  information  upon  the  condi-</span><span>  tion  of  the  fruit  industry  in  that  colony,</span><span>  the  consideration  of  which  cannot  fail  to</span><span>  bc  interesting  and  profitable  to  many  of</span><span>  our  readers.  In  Adelaide  and  its</span><span>  vicinity  preserving  works  have  been</span><span>  established,  which  are  now  doing  a  large</span><span>  trade-circulating  great  sums  of  money,</span><span>  and  giving  occupation  to  numerous</span><span>  hands.  Many  years  ago  a  woman  named</span><span>  Mrs.  Chance  began  the  manufacture  of</span><span>  tomato  sauce,  and  fancied  she  was  doing</span><span>  well  when  she  turned  out  three  dozen</span><span>  bottles  in  one  season.  The  sauce</span><span>  making  proved  so  remunerative  that</span><span>  jam-making  was  added.  With  the  assis-</span><span>  tance  of  her  son  a  factory  was  estab-</span><span>  lished.  The  building  at  first  was  eighty</span><span>  feet  long  by  fifteen  feet  broad.  As  the</span><span>  trade  prospered  capitalists  bought  into</span><span>  the  concern,  and  now  it  has  attained</span><span>  large  dimensions.  The  boiling-room</span><span>  alone  is  eighty  by  twenty  feet,  and  there</span><span>  are  store-rooms  and  work-rooms,  nume-</span><span>  rous  and  capacious.  Last  year,  we</span><span>  learn,  the  firm  manufactured  and</span><span>  sold  two  hundred  and  fifty  tons</span><span>  of  jam,  equal  to  five  hundred</span><span>  thousand  pound  tins.  In  a  good  year</span><span>  the  firm  turn  out  thirty-six  thousand</span><span>  pints  of  tomato  sauce.  Besides  jams</span><span>  and  sauces  tinned  fruits  and  pickles  are</span><span>  manufactured  in  large  quantities.  The</span><span>  preservation  of  candied  peel  employs</span></p> <p><span>  the  bulk  of  the  hands  at  the  season  when</span><span>  fruits  are  scarce.  In  jams  and  tinned</span><span>  fruits  alone  three  hundred  and  fifty  tons</span><span>  will  be  turned  out  this  season,  worth,  at</span><span>  £50  a  ton,  .¿,17,500.  Add  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  revenue  from  these  the  income  from</span></p> <p><span>  tomato  sauce,  candied  peel,  &""  and  it</span><span>  will  be  seen  that  a  most  profitable  and</span><span>  flourishing  industry  has  been  established.</span><span>  In  another  fruit  factory  the  use  of</span><span>  drying  machinery  has  been  introduced.</span><span>  Fruits  suitable  for  the  operation  are</span><span>  placed  on  wire  trays,  and  exposed  to</span><span>  currents  of  hot  air.  In  this  way  they</span><span>  are  completely  desiccated  in  a  few  flours.</span><span>  Sliced  apples  and  potatoes  are  greatly  re-</span><span>  duced  in  bulk.  Carefully  packed  they</span><span>  can  be  forwarded  long  distances  by  sea</span><span>  and  land,  without  losing  their  peculiar</span><span>  nourishing  properties.  Steam  driven  ma-</span><span>  chinery  plays  a  most  important  part  in</span><span>  these  factories,  and  greatly  facilitates</span><span>  operations.  The  large  tinned  cop-</span><span>  pers  in  which  thc  jams  arc  pre-</span><span>  pared  are  jacketed,  and  heated  by</span><span>  steam.  Pans,  tanks,  driers,  lifts,  are</span><span>  worked  by  steam,  and  an  ingenious</span><span>  Yankee  piece  of  mechanism  has  been</span><span>  introduced,  which,  working  by  steam,</span><span>  solders  in  thc  ends  of  the  fruit  cans.</span><span>  Of  course  several  hands  are  needed  to</span><span>  attend  to  the  machinery,  and  in  several</span><span>  departments  of  the  industry  manual</span><span>  labour  cannot  be  dispensed  with.  In</span><span>  Chance  and  Company's  establishment</span><span>  eighty  hands  are  employed.  One  half  of</span><span>  that  number  arc  girls,  who  are  employed</span><span>  labelling,  packing,  and  box-making.</span><span>  The  wood  is  cut  to  size,  and  a  smart  girl</span><span>  can  make  eighty  boxes  a  day,  and,  getting</span><span>  a  penny  for  each,  realises  f;ood  wages.</span><span>  The  tins  arc  made  outside  the  establish-</span><span>  ments,  and  employ  a  numerous  contin-</span><span>  gent  of  tinsmiths.</span></p> <p><span>  There  are  three  fruit  faetones  at</span><span>  Adelaide,  and  each  finds  a  ready  market</span><span>  for  all  it  can  manufacture.  Among  the</span><span>  fruits  dealt  with  are  grapes,  apples,</span><span>  pears,  peaches,  nectaries,  plums,  rasp-</span><span>  berries,  black-berries,  mulberries,  figs,</span></p> <p><span>  rhubarb,  apricots,  .and  quinces.  Among</span><span>  preserved  vegetables  are  peas,  potatoes,</span><span>  tomatoes,  French  beans,  etc.  The</span><span>  greatest  difficulty  in  the  way  of  the</span><span>  expansion  of  these  fruit  factories,  is  the</span><span>  wanto!  supplies.  Tbeycannotgetasmuch</span><span>  fruit  as  they  requiie.  In  order  to  meet</span><span>  the  demands  made  on  them  the.'ownets</span><span>  have  to  import  large  quantities  of  fruit</span><span>  from  Victoria  and  Tasmania.  About  one</span><span>  third  of  the  tolal  quantity  preserved  is</span><span>  imported.  This  is  due  in  part  to  the</span><span>  failure  of  the  crops  from  drought  or</span><span>  other  causes.  It  does  not  do  to</span><span>  depend  altogether  for  certain  kinds  of</span><span>  fruit  on  the  local  supply.  In  the  mean-</span><span>  time,  however,  fruit  culturists  have  no</span><span>  difficulty  in  getting  rid  of  all  they  can</span><span>  grow,  at  steady  remunerative  prices.</span></p> <p><span>  From  what  we  have  said,  we  think,</span><span>  it  must  be  apparent  that  in  the</span><span>  efforts  made  by  Mr.  A.  Kohler,  Pink</span><span>  Lily  we  have  the  beginnings  of  what</span><span>  may  prove  an  important  industry</span><span>  in  this  district.  It  rests  with  the  farmers</span><span>  and  selectors  of  the  vicinity  to  demon-</span><span>  strate  whether  this  shall  be  the  case.</span><span>  Mrs.  Chance,  in  Adelaide,  began  with</span><span>  three  dozen  bottles  of  tomato  sauce  in</span><span>  one  season  ;  and  now  the  firm  employs</span></p> <p><span>  nearly  a  hundred  hands,  and  has  a  turn-1</span><span>  over  of  upwards  of  tweüty  thousand  I</span><span>  pounds  of  capital  annually.  There  is</span><span>  this  stimulus  to  growers  in  this  dis</span></p> <p><span>  trict,  the  advantages  of  which  they  j</span><span>  never  seem  lo  have  .  realised,  that  '</span><span>  a  large  trade  in  tropical  fruits</span><span>  awaits  development  at  their  hands.  It</span><span>  would  be  useless  to  compete  with  S.</span><span>  Australia  and  Tasmania  in  the  manu-</span><span>  facture  of  jams,  but  in  the  exportation</span><span>  of  tinned  fruits  such  as  pineapples,</span><span>  mangoes,  guavas,  loquats,  mulberries,</span><span>  and  fruits  like  the  whampee,  of  which  we</span><span>  have  not  learned  the  true  value,  a  large</span><span>  amount  of  busines  might  be  done.  It</span><span>  seems  funny  from  its  absurdity,  that</span><span>  while  we  can  grow  sugar,  oranges,  and</span><span>  limes  in  abundance,  we  should  send</span><span>  money  out  of  the  colony  for  marmalade</span><span>  and  limejuice.  Fruit  culture  and  manu-</span><span>  facture  in  Queensland  demand  attention,</span><span>  and  we  hope  they  will  not  be  neglected</span><span>  by  the  farmers  and  selectors  of  this</span></p> <p><span>  district.</span></p> <p><span>  Avrnovan  we  are  oat  at  all  inclined  ta</span><span>  sympathise  with  strikes,  there  are  occa-</span><span>  sions  when  even  this  method  of  demanding</span><span>  justice  is  allowable.  .The  strike  among  the</span><span>  femalo  operatives  employed  in  the  Melboure</span><span>  clothing  trade  is  quite  a  new  development  of</span><span>  thc  system  in  the  colonies,  and  it  will  gene-</span><span>  rally  bo  admitted  that,  when  women  Btrike</span><span>  ther  must  be  something  very  unbearably</span><span>  wrong.  Women  have  aot  the  same  amount  of</span><span>  resistance  in  their  nature  a«  men.  They  will</span><span>  submit  to  injustice  longer,  and  dread  thc  con-</span><span>  sequences  of  anything  like  a  conflict,  so  that</span><span>  when  they  turn  out  on  strike,  we  may  be  very</span><span>  certain  they  have  been  reduced  to  desperation.</span><span>  From  personal  knowledge  we  may  state  that</span><span>  thousands  of  girls  io  Melbourne  work  from</span><span>  eight  to  six  per  day,  and  only  earn  seven  and</span><span>  eight  shillings  per  week.  _  In  the  dress-</span><span>  making  trade  twelve  shillings  is  a  good</span><span>  wage  per  week  for  a  machinist  to  get</span><span>  io  Melbourne,  and  these  girls  have  to</span><span>  work  at  all  hours  if  orders  are  not  completed.</span><span>  It  may  be  fairly  Ba  id  that  tailoresses,  dress-</span><span>  makers'  assistants,  machinists,  and  sem</span><span>  stressea  in  the  Southern  capital  are  ground</span><span>  down  to  the  very  lowest  rate  of  pay,  that</span><span>  they  aro  worked  outrageously  long  hours,  and</span><span>  dismissed  without  a  moment's  warning  if</span><span>  work  runB  out.  It  is  well  known  that  a</span></p> <p><span>  vast  majority  of  girls  now-a-day  prefer  factory</span><span>  i  work  to  domestic  service,  as  they  are  more</span></p> <p><span>  their  own  mistresses,  and  generally  have  their</span><span>  evenings  to  themselves.  This  bas  caused  a</span><span>  I  glut  in  the  labour  market,  and  wages  hare,  as</span></p> <p><span>  a  natural  consequence,  become  lower  and</span><span>  loner.  It  will  be  seen  by  our  Adelaide  tele-</span><span>  grams  that  in  that  city  the  operatives  in  the</span><span>  clothing  trade  have  held  a  meeting  to  sympa-</span><span>  thise  with  the  Melbourne  girls,  and  offer  them</span><span>  substantial  support.</span></p> <p><span>  Last  week  probate  was  granted  out  of  the</span><span>  Supremo  Court  in  the  will  of  Thornton</span><span>  Augustus  Kennedy  Morris,  Rockhampton,  to</span><span>  .Mary  Ellen  Morris,  widow,  personality,</span></p> <p><span>  £2000.</span></p> <p><span>  ADVANTAGE  will  be  taken  of  the  half-holiday</span><span>  to-morrow  (Wednesday)  to  play  a  cricket</span><span>  match  between  teams  representing  the  estab-</span><span>  lishments  of  Messrs.

In  every  movement  for  the</span><span>  advancement  of  the  town  or  benefit  ot  the</span></p> <p><span>  community  he  had  been  every  ready,  to  take  a</span><span>  foremost  part.

"<p><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span></p> <p><span>  TUESDAY,  JUNE  28,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  AT  noon  to-day  the  ActingGovernor</span><span>  will  adivêfTïïs  opening  Speech  io  Hie</span><span>  members  of  Parliament  who  will  (hen</span></p> <p><span>  assemble  in  the  Legislative  Council.</span><span>  There  will  be  a  brilliant  gathering,  no</span><span>  doubt,  of  fair  women  as  well  as  clever</span><span>  men,  and  the  powerful  voice  of  Sir</span><span>  Arthur  Palmer  will  make  every  word</span><span>  distinctly  audible  in  the  remotest  corner</span><span>  or  the  Lords'  chamber.  The  topics</span><span>  referred  to  will  possibly  be  various.  The</span><span>  country  will  most  certainly  be  congratu-</span><span>  lated  upon  the  capture  of  New  Guihea.</span><span>  The  Legislative  Assembly  will  be</span><span>  cheered  by  the  announcement  that  the</span><span>  revenue  is  buoyant-that  the  year,  not-</span><span>  withstanding  the  ever-increasing  demands</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  public  service,  will  probably  close  j</span><span>  with  a  surplus  of  a  quarter  of  a  million,  |</span><span>  making  the  accumulated  surpluses  of  the  i</span><span>  last  two  years  just  half  a  million-and</span><span>  that  the  country  has  never  been  at  any</span><span>  previous  time  in  its  history  so  generally</span><span>  prosperous,  or  its  industries  in  so  sound</span><span>  a  condition.  There  will,  indeed,  be  a</span><span>  gratifying  record  of  which  Ministers  and</span><span>  their  friends  may  be  justifiably  proud.</span></p> <p><span>  Nor  will  their  satisfaciion  be  much</span><span>  lessened  when  the  Opposition  declare</span><span>  that  the  success  is  due  to  luck  and  not</span></p> <p><span>  to  capacity  or  prudence.  For  history</span><span>  tells  us  that  the  Liberals,  so-called,</span><span>  have  never  held  power  without</span><span>  inaugurating-  disaster,  while  the  past</span><span>  four  years  of  prosperity,  though  a</span><span>  usual  accompaniment  of  Conservative</span><span>  dominancy,  surpasses  the  prosperity  of</span><span>  any  previous  Conservative  era.  These</span><span>  facts,  therefore,  must  tell  ;  and,  if  the</span><span>  constituencies  are  wise,  will  influence</span><span>  many  voters  in  casting  their  ballot-papers</span><span>  at  the  impending  elections.</span></p> <p><span>  But  much  more  debateable  topics</span><span>  will  be  dealt  with  in  the  speech.  Sir</span><span>  Arthur's  deliverance  upon  the  subject  of</span><span>  the  Transcontinental  Railway  will  be</span><span>  anticipated  with  breathless  interest.</span><span>  Upon  it  the  struggle  of  the  week  will</span><span>  mainly  be  conducted,  for  upon  it  the</span><span>  fate  of  the  Ministry  will  hang.  The</span><span>  general  opinion  is  that  the  agreement</span><span>  will  be  thrown  out  by  a  small  majority  if</span><span>  it  should  ever  come  under  discussion  ;</span><span>  hut  let  us  hope  it  will  not,  except  as  a</span><span>  paragraph  of  the  speech.  It  would  be</span><span>  utterly  hopeless  to  bring  in  the  validating</span><span>  bill  in  the  present  Assembly,  for  if  there</span><span>  was  but  a  Government  majority  of  two</span><span>  on  the  Warrego  Bill,  it  seems  impossible</span><span>  thal  hy  any  accident  a  working  majority</span><span>  should  vote  for  the  Transcontinental</span></p> <p><span>  Bill,  lt  is  true  thai  lhere  will  be  many</span><span>  absentees  from  the  Assembly  Chamber</span><span>  on  both  sides,  but  with  the  Ministerial</span><span>  cross-bench  members  on  their  side  the</span></p> <p><span>  Opposition  will  make  a  very  respectable</span><span>  show  in  respect  of  numbers.  It  has</span><span>  been  already  pointed  out  in  a</span><span>  southern  contemporary  that  the  more</span><span>  constitutional  and  convenient  course</span><span>  would  be  for  the  Opposition  to</span><span>  move  a  want  of  confidence  amendment</span><span>  on  thc  address,  or  at  least  to  obtain  a</span><span>  direct  expression  of  opinion  hostile  lo</span><span>  ihe  Transcontinental  project.  Thal</span><span>  being  carried,  the  Government  must</span><span>  resign  or  dissolve.  The  former  they</span><span>  can  do  without  the  Acting-Governor's</span><span>  consent.  The  latter  will  be  subject  la</span></p> <p><span>  his  sanction.  If  he  thinks  the  voice  of</span><span>  the  country  is  against  the  agreement,</span><span>  and  that  the  Opposition  will  be  able  to</span><span>  form  a.  Ministry  commanding  a  working</span><span>  majority,  he  may  refuse  a  dissolution  at</span><span>  the  outset.  At  any  rate,  he  is  not  bound</span><span>  to  grant  a  dissolution  until  satisfied  that</span><span>  the  present  Assembly  does  not  represent</span><span>  the  country.  It  is  just  possible,  then,</span><span>  that  in  the  present  state  of  the  public</span><span>  business,  his  Excellency  may  think  the</span></p> <p><span>  better  course  would  be  for  Mr.  Griffith</span><span>  to  try  his  hand  at  passing  the  Estimates</span><span>  and  other  urgent  measures,  and  then</span><span>  dissolve  during  the  usual  recess.  But</span><span>  this  does  not  seem  probable,  because</span><span>  the  present  Assembly  was  elected  under</span><span>  the  auspices  of  Mr.  Griffith's  party,  and</span></p> <p><span>  therefore  the  dissolution  is  constitu-</span><span>  tionally  the  privilege  of  Sir  Thomas</span><span>  M'llwraith's  Ministry.  Of  course  they</span><span>  may  forego  that  privilege,  ot  Mr.  Griffith,</span><span>  once  in  power,  may  be  able  to  convince</span><span>  the  Acting-Governorthat  thenew  Ministry</span><span>  are  entitled  to  carry  through  the  session</span><span>  if  they  can.  If  this  should  be  attempted,</span><span>  the  then  Opposition  would  either  have</span><span>  to  submit  or  engage  in  obstruction  either</span><span>  admitted  or  tacit.  Forit  mustremembered</span><span>  that  a  general  election,  when  the</span><span>  Assembly  expires  by  effluxion  of  time,  is</span><span>  not  an  appeal  ;  and  hence  if  the  Griffith</span><span>  party  are  so  powerful  in  the  House  and</span><span>  the  country  as  their  friends  assume,  they</span><span>  may  be  able  to  convince  Sir  Arthur</span><span>  Palmer  that  they  could  cany  through</span><span>  the  session,  and  then  be  the  Ministry,</span><span>  who,  by  accident,  were  in  power  when</span><span>  the  general  election  took  place.  Under</span><span>  such  circumstances,  however,  a  moribund</span><span>  Assembly  would  take  upon  itself  to  throw</span><span>  out  the  land-grant  projects  without</span><span>  affording  the  country  an  opportunity  of</span><span>  pronouncing  upon  them.  This  would</span><span>  he  a  proceeding  not  quite  constitutional,</span><span>  and  it  is  not  really  very  likely  to  be</span><span>  ventured  upon.</span></p> <p><span>  Yet  it  is  not  at  all  unlikely  that  if</span><span>  beaten  in  what  they  deemed  an  unfair</span><span>  manner,  or  so  as  to  place  them  at  a  tem-</span><span>  porary  disadvantage  with  the  consti-</span><span>  tuencies,  Ministers  will  not  advise  a</span><span>  dissolution,  but  let  Mr.  Griffith  try  his</span><span>  hand  at  Cabinet  making  in  the  expecta-</span><span>  tion  that  he  would  not  succeed  and  then</span><span>  that  the  Ministry  would  be  recalled.</span><span>  In  such  case  the  session  might</span><span>  either  go  on  and  the  general  election</span><span>  taite  place  in  the  recess,  or  an  immediate</span><span>  dissolution  might  take  place.  The  latter</span><span>  would  certainly  be  the  most  proper</span><span>  course,  and  we  are  inclined  to  think  that</span><span>  it  will  be  followed.  Unless  we  are  mis-</span><span>  taken,  the  general  election  will  be  over</span><span>  and  the  new  Parliament  in  session  by  thc</span><span>  middle  of  October.  Foi  although  the</span><span>  last  general  election  was  spread  over</span><span>  three  montis,  the  means  of  communica-</span><span>  tion  have  row  so  much  improved  that</span><span>  should  the  writs  be  issued  on  the  ist</span><span>  August  the  hst  should  be  returnable  by</span><span>  15th  October  without  giving  ground  for</span><span>  any  reasonable  charge  of  undue  haste.</span></p> <p><span>  TUE  remainder  of  the  Almora's  immigrants</span><span>  were  brought  up  to  town  yesterday  afternoon</span><span>  in  the  s.s.

The  mill  at</span><span>  Mr.  Ferguson's,  Lumeah,  ia  nearly  completed,</span></p> <p><span>  and  will  oommence  work  next  week.

A  female,  charged  with</span><span>  drunkenness,  was  cautioned  and  discharged.</span><span>  Charles  Green  was  charged  with  deserting</span><span>  from  the  schooner  Hugh  Ewing.  Charles</span><span>  Scott,  master  of  the  vessel,  deposed  that  he</span><span>  engaged  Green  for  six  months,  commencing</span><span>  on  tho  1st  June.

Green  was  ordered  to  return</span><span>  to  the  ship.  The  Police  Magistrate  held  that</span><span>  the  mau  had  a  right  to  see  the  Shipping</span><span>  Master  if  he  had  any  complaints  to  make.</span></p> <p><span>  The  ""  Rose  of  Castile,""  one  of  Balfe's  best</span><span>  compositions,  was  rendered  in  tho  Theatre</span><span>  last  night  by  the  Montague-Tamer  company</span><span>  in  a  very  effective  manner.  As  is  well  known</span><span>  to  ever  patron  of  the  opera,  it  contains</span><span>  music  of  a  very  taking  character,  the  chief</span><span>  arias  being  familiar  to  the  ear,  and  the</span><span>  dialogue  somewhat  entertaining  to  the</span><span>  general  publio  because  it  verges  on</span><span>  the  comic  without  being  too  broad,  and</span><span>  tho  situations  in  which  thc  principals  appear</span><span>  are  to  say  the  least  of  it  admirably</span><span>  appreciative.  As  Elvira,  the  Rose  of  Castile,</span><span>  Miss  Montague,  sustained  ber  reputation</span><span>  as  a  vocalist.  Her  fully  cultured  voice</span><span>  was  heard  to  advantage  in  the  ballad  of  the</span><span>  ""Couvent  Cell""  and  ""I'm  but  a  simple</span><span>  peasant  girl.""  In  the  latter  air  the  modu-</span><span>  lations  of  her  voice  were  exceedingly</span><span>  pleasing  and  the  different  runB  executed  with</span><span>  taste  and  feeling.  Uer  acting  contributed  in</span><span>  every  way  to  thc  successful  rendoriug  of  those</span><span>  two  very  difficult  songs  ;  and  in  the  Throne</span><span>  soeno  her  declamatory  utterances  were  given</span><span>  with  true  artistic  taste.  Aa  Carmon,  Mies</span><span>  Lorne  was  fairly  Rood,  and  in  the  opening</span><span>  duct  with  Miss  Montaguo  used  her  voice</span><span>  with  judgment.  Mr,  Turner  enacted</span><span>  thc  Muletee  with  hid  accustomed  success)</span><span>  Thc  Muleteer's  song  and  ""  Could'st  thou,</span><span>  dear  maid  ""  wcro  sung  with  exquisite  taste,</span><span>  and  deserved  the  applause  bestowed.  As  Don</span><span>  Pedro  Mr.  Browning  appeared  to  advantage  ai</span><span>  a  conspirator,  and  gave  ""Though  fortune</span><span>  darkly  o'er  mc  frowns  ""  with  such  evident</span><span>  SUCCCBS  that  he  narrowly  escaped  an  encore.</span><span>  MeBsrs.  Trcvorah  and  Balfour  as  Don  Florie</span><span>  and  Don  Sallust  saug  thc  music  aliottod  to</span><span>  the  parts  capitally,  and  with  Mr,  Browning  in</span><span>  tho  trio  of  ""Wine,  thc  Magician  thou  art,""</span><span>  were  well  received.  The  minor  characters</span><span>  did  material  justice  to  the  music.  The  chorus</span><span>  was  iu  admirable  voioe  and  thc  ensemble  in</span><span>  each  scene  very  attractive.  Tho  orchestral</span><span>  accompaniments  were  played,  as  usual,  with</span><span>  skill  under  Mr.  Delaney's  direction.  To-</span><span>  night  Donizetti's  tragical  three  act  opera  of</span><span>  ""  Lucrczia  Borgia  ""  will  be  produced.</span></p> <p><span>  LOCKING  THE  DAHUNU.-In  September,</span><span>  1882,  Mr.  G.

spicuous,  there  can  be  no  doubt  as  to</span><span>  their  meaning  Mr  Gladstone  s  Cabinet</span><span>  have  resolved  not  to  confirm  the  pro</span><span>  cecding  of  Queensland,  in  annexing</span><span>  New  Guinea  m  the  Queen  s  name,  and</span><span>  ha\e  declared  they  have  no  fear  of  the</span><span>  annexation  of  New  Guinea  by  any  foreign</span><span>  nation  A  despatch  embodying  these</span><span>  views  is  now  in  course  of  transmission</span><span>  to  Queensland  The  Government  in</span><span>  dicate,  as  one  of  their  reasons  (or  refus</span><span>  ing  to  recognise  the  action  of  this</span><span>  Colony,  that  it  is  null  and  Void  in  point</span><span>  of  law  We  are  at  a  loss  to  know  ft  hat</span><span>  law  has  been  violated  So  far  as  we</span><span>  have  read  history,  it  appears  to  us  that</span><span>  from  Columbus  downwards  there  has</span><span>  be/n  no  law  on  the  subject  The  early</span><span>  explorers  took  possession  of  the  lands</span><span>  they  discovered  or  coveted  by  doing  as</span><span>  Mr  Chester  did-unfurling  the  British</span><span>  flag,  and  declaring  the  land  to  be  hence</span><span>  forth  a  part  of  the  Sovereign's  dominion</span><span>  What  an  individual  could  do  without</span><span>

declared  null  and</span><span>  void  because  it  was  without  precedent,</span><span>  and  was  an  infringement  of  some  under</span><span>  stood  bul  unwritten  law  1  he  intima</span><span>  lion,  that  the  Government  has  no  fear  of</span><span>  New  Guinea  being  annexed  by  any</span><span>  foreign  power,  has  not  been  made,  we</span><span>  daresay,  without  good  grounds  In  all</span><span>  likelihood,  after  the  stir  which  has  been</span><span>  made  about  the  matter  in  European</span><span>  political  circles,  it  has  formed  the  subject</span><span>  of  diplomatic  notes  Political  con</span><span>  siderations,  of  which  it  is  impossible  for</span><span>  people  m  this  colony  to  understand  the</span><span>  consequence,  have  probably  had  much</span><span>  to  do  with  the  determination  of  the  Im</span><span>  penal  Government  When  the  topic</span><span>  first  came  up  for  discussion  we  pointed</span><span>  out  that  the  party  now  in  power</span><span>  have  been  stoutly  opposed  to  that</span><span>  imperialism  in  politics,  which  included</span><span>  in  its  practice  the  extension  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Hntisti  empire  1  here  can  be  no  doubt,</span><span>  moreover,  that  any  influence  Britain</span><span>  might  have  in  the

people</span><span>  of  the  United  Kingdom  A  large  and</span><span>  active  section  AT  Radical  politicians</span></p> <p><span>  have  '  A|^B^^BMLdeQounced  the  I</span></p> <p><span>

 meet</span><span>  with  hearty  commendation  To  the</span><span>  mass  of  the  electors  of  the  United</span><span>  Kingdom  the  whole  affair  will  possess</span><span>  little  interest,  and  the  Government  will</span><span>  suffer  little  either  of  praise  or  blame  for</span><span>  the  manner  in  which  they  have  dealt</span></p> <p><span>  with  it</span></p> <p><span>  Nevertheless,  we  are  convinced  that</span><span>  the  subject  has  not  received  that  amount</span><span>  of  consideration  tram  the  Imperial</span><span>  Government,  and  the  press  of  the  United</span><span>  Kingdom,  to  which  it  was  entitled  We</span><span>  are  led  to  this  belief  by  the  manner  in</span><span>  winch  it  has  be°n  dealt  with  by  the  lead</span><span>  ing  London  newspapers  The  Innes</span><span>  has  been  maundering  on  the  subject  In</span><span>  the  weekly  issue  of  May  18th  it  contains</span><span>  a  contribution  from  ""a  correspondent  of</span><span>  of  distinction  and  experience,'  on  which</span><span>  it  bases  an  article  antagonistic  to  annexa</span><span>  non  The  writer  in  question  discusses</span><span>  two  distinct  questions  shall  the  sove</span><span>  reignty  of  the  Queen  be  extended  to</span><span>  New  Guinea  at  all  ?  and,  if  it  be  so,</span><span>  shall  the  island  be  annexed  to  the  exist</span><span>  ing  colony  of  Queensland  ?  He  answers</span><span>  these  questions  in  the  negative  because</span><span>  of  the  size  of  the  territory  proposed</span><span>  to  be  annexed,  but  he  proceeds  in</span><span>  the  belief  that  Queensland  wanted  the</span><span>  whole  island,  and  not  the  Southern</span><span>  portion  of  it  only  He  argues,  more</span><span>  over,  that  Quehnsland  is  specially</span><span>  unfitted  for  the  task  of  governing  New</span><span>  Guinea,  because  the  colonists  would</span><span>  treat  the  inhabitants  as  they  do  the</span><span>  Australian  natives  This  is  an  assump</span><span>  lion  which  is  not  very  complimentary  to</span><span>  Queeenslanders  But  it  is  ill  founded,</span><span>  because,  in  our  intercourse  with  the</span><span>  natives  of  the  South  Sea  Islands,  the</span><span>  people  of  this  colony  have  had  practical</span><span>  experience  and  observation  of  the</span><span>  differences  of  black  races,  and  on  that</span><span>  account  would  be  peculiarly  qualified  for</span><span>  dealing  with  the  New  Gumeans  To</span><span>  assume  again,  as  this  correspondent  of</span></p> <p><span>  distinction  does,  that  the  Government</span><span>  would  treat  the  land  of  New  Guinea,</span><span>  cultivated  as  it  is  by  stationary  tribes,  as</span><span>  we  have  done  that  of  Australia,  which</span><span>  was  sparsely  occupied  by  small  wander</span><span>  ing,  unsettled  parties,  is  an  insult  to  our</span><span>  common  sense-not  to  speak  of  the</span><span>  wisdom  and  experience  of  our  Parha</span><span>  mentary  representatives  It  is  argued</span><span>  further  that  the  Queensland  colonists,</span><span>  ""  even  the  most  enlightened  and</span><span>  humane,""  look  upon  natives  as</span><span>  an  encumbrance  on  the  soil  ,</span><span>  and,  therefore,  they  would  treat</span><span>  the  Papuans  harshly,  cruelly,  and  un</span><span>  justly  Our  readers  will  scarcely  believe</span><span>  that  this  unwarranted  reflection  on  their</span><span>  humanity  and  intelligence,  should  be</span><span>  accepted  as  indisputable  by  the  leading</span><span>  English  journal  Its  untruthfulness  calls</span><span>  for  no  other  comment  than  unqualified</span><span>  condemnation  Another  argumentagainst</span><span>  annexation,  advanced  and  supported  by</span><span>  the  leading  journal  of  the  United  King</span><span>  dom,  is  that  ""  the  island  would  become</span><span>  available  as  a  recruiting  ground  for</span><span>  labour  without  any  restrictions,  other</span><span>  than  those  which  the  Parliament  of</span><span>  Queensland  itself  might  think  fit  to</span><span>  impose  ""  On  this  very  ground  our  Go</span><span>  vernment  have  justified  the  annexation</span><span>  At  present  New  Guinea  is  in  tne  same</span><span>  position  as  the  Southern  Pacific</span><span>  Islands  Labour  may  be  recruited</span><span>  there  now  As  the  supply  from</span><span>  the  South  Sea  Islands  begins  to</span></p> <p><span>  fail  the  likelihood  of  New  Guinea</span><span>  being  resorted  to  becomes  very</span><span>  evident,  To  prevent  the  intrusion  of</span><span>  labour  traders  on  its  shores  our  Govern</span><span>  meat  proposed  to  exercise  a  protectorate</span><span>  over  the  latter,  but  this  privilege  the</span><span>  Imperial  Government  has  denied  them</span><span>  So  far  as  the  labour  traffic  is  concerned</span></p> <p><span>  I  there  is  (ree  trade  with  Papua,  and  if</span></p> <p><span>  some  of  the  chiefs  begin  to  find  it  is</span><span>  lucrative  and  exciting,  it  may  soon</span><span>  be  cultivated  and  attain  considerable</span></p> <p><span>  '  dimensions  Instead  of  encovraging,</span></p> <p><span>  annexation  would  have  had  the  effect  of</span><span>  discouraging  the  labour  trade</span></p> <p><span>  What  the  result  will  be  of  the  deter</span><span>  mination  of  the  Imperial  Government</span><span>  on  this  matter,  will  now  form  the  ground</span><span>  of  considerable  speculation  In  the</span><span>  colonies  their  decision  will  not  bereceived</span><span>  withfavour  Judgingfrom  what  transpired</span><span>  at  the  opening  of  the  Victorian  Parha</span><span>  ment,  our  neighbours  in  the  South</span><span>  are  more  excited  than  we  are  upon</span><span>  the  subject  It  does  not  seem  to  have</span><span>  crossed  their  minds,  that  the  annexation</span><span>  of  New  Guinea  would  not  be  confirmed,</span><span>  and  they  apparently  took  it  for  granted</span><span>  that  their  demands  respecting  the</span><span>  acquisition  of  the  New  Hebrides  would</span><span>  meet  with  no  serious  opposition  Their</span><span>  irritation  will  be  in  proportion  to  their</span><span>  disappointment  But  a  little  temporary</span><span>  ebullition  of  feeling  on  the  the  part  of</span><span>  our  colonists  will  do  little  harm,  and</span><span>  may  be  mollified,  but  what  effect</span></p> <p><span>  the  declinature  of  the  British  Govern</span></p> <p><span>  ment  to  annex  the  country  will  have  on</span></p> <p><span>  other  nations  is  a  more  serious  matter</span></p> <p><span>  Practically,  they  ha\e  declared  that  New</span><span>  Zealand  is  to  let-rent  free,  and  that  any</span><span>  power,  which  cares  to  be  at  the  trouble</span><span>  and  expense,  may  take  possession  of  it</span><span>  So  long  as  the  dangers,  which  have  been</span><span>  repeatedly  pointed  out  as  to  be  feared  in</span><span>  connexion  with  its  occupation  of  a</span><span>  foreign  power,  threaten  this  country,  the</span><span>  people  will  never  feel  safe  or  satisfied</span></p> <p><span>  On  this  question  the  difference  of</span><span>  opinion  between  the  United  Kingdom</span></p> <p><span>  and  the  Australian  colonies  is  most</span><span>  distinct  and  decided  ,  nor

"<p><span>  [  .  KOCKHAMl'TON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY.  AUGUST  27,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  ?  »</span></p> <p><span>  IN  English  papers,  recently  to  hand,  we</span><span>  have  an  opportunity  of  becoming</span><span>  acquainted  with  the  details  of  some  of</span><span>  the  provisions  of  a  bill,  which  has  been</span><span>  submitted  to  the  Imperial  Parliament,</span><span>  having  for  its  object  the  purification  of</span><span>  parliamentary  elections.  Where  the</span><span>  electors  are  grouped  in  large  masses,  as</span><span>  they  are  in  large  English  towns,  and  the</span><span>  individuality  of  voters  is  on  that  account</span><span>  difficult  of  identification,  there  can  be  no</span><span>  doubt  that  impersonation  and  double</span><span>  voting  are  more  rife  than  with  us.  In</span><span>  the  United  Kingdom  electoral  rolls  are</span><span>  watched  more  closely  by  the  professional</span><span>  agents  of  both  parties,  and  as  a  matter</span><span>  of  fact  no  fresh  enrolment  takes  place</span><span>  without  being  liable  to  be  challenged.</span><span>  The  common  practice  is  to  enlist  the</span><span>  assistance  of  the  party's  agent  to  prove</span><span>  the  title  to  enfranchisement.  Our</span><span>  interest  in  legislation  of  this  character</span><span>  ought  to  be  excited  by  events,  which,  it</span><span>  is  said,  have  lately  taken  place  in  our</span><span>  midst.  In  our  recent  election  it  is</span></p> <p><span>  commonly  reported  that  impersonation</span><span>  was  practised.  Some  rumours  go</span><span>  so  far  as  to  say  that  some</span><span>  dishonest  voters  recorded  their  votes</span><span>  in  two  places  in  one  electorate.  It  would</span><span>  be  comparatively  easy  for  the  Return-</span><span>  ing  Officer  to  prevent  the  last-named</span><span>  abuse,  by  adopting  a  system  of  alpha-</span><span>  betical  division  of  polling  places.  It  is</span><span>  to  be  hoped  we  may  benefit  by  the  ex-</span><span>  perience  so  recently  gained  when  the</span><span>  constituency-which  is  now  becoming  of</span><span>  considerable  numerical  proportions-is</span><span>  next  called  upon  to  exercise  a  choice  of</span><span>  representatives.</span></p> <p><span>  Some  idea  of  the  scope  and  intentions</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  Corrupt  Practices  Bill  may  be  |</span><span>  gathered  from  the  fact  that  the  punish-</span><span>  ment,  launched  against  bribery  and</span></p> <p><span>  corruption,  is  directed  mainly  at  the  I</span></p> <p><span>  candidate  upon  whose  behalf  the  pro-</span><span>  ceedings  are  practiced.  It  would  appear</span></p> <p><span>  to  be  the  intention  of  the  framers  of  the  j</span></p> <p><span>  measure  to  throw  upon  the  candidate  j</span><span>  the  onus  of  proof  of  his  ignorance  of  the</span><span>  illegal  acts  of  his  agents  It  will  be</span><span>  remembered  that  Parliament  at  home  is</span></p> <p><span>  elected  for  the  btv  en  )ears,  although  one</span><span>  seldom  exists  so  long,  and  this  seems  to</span><span>  have  been  the  reason  for  the  stipulation</span><span>  that,  should  the  agent  of  any  candidate</span><span>  be  guilty  of  any  bribery  or  malpractices,</span><span>  his  principal  shall  be  incapable  of  sitting</span><span>  as  member  for  that  constituency  for  the</span><span>  seven)  earsnextensumg.after  the  decisi^i</span><span>  of  the  court  establishing  the  disqualifying</span></p> <p><span>  condition  The  effect  of  this  would  be</span></p> <p><span>  practically  to  preclude  the  candidate,  on</span><span>  whose  behalf  the  ict  was  committed,</span><span>  from  securing  any  advantage  from  ii,  al</span><span>  least  till  after  the  next  ensuing  general</span><span>  election  Any  candidate  who  is  per</span><span>  sonally  guilty  of  corrupt  practices,  it  is</span><span>  also  provided,  shall  be  for  ever  in</span><span>  capable  of  being  elected  for  the</span><span>  I  constituency  in  which  the  offence  was</span></p> <p><span>  committed,  shall  be  ineligible  for  ten</span><span>  years  for  election  by  any  constituency  in</span><span>  Great  Britain  For  seven  years  he  shall</span><span>  be  deprived  of  his  right  to  vote  at  any</span><span>  public  election,  and  if  he  hold  any</span><span>  public  office,  or  official  appointment  of</span><span>  any  kind,  he  shall  forthwith  be  deprived</span><span>  of  it  Various  punishments  for  minor</span><span>  offences  are  provided,  ranging  from  two</span><span>  years'  imprisonment  downwards,  and</span><span>  fines,  not  exceeding  .£200,  are  scheduled</span><span>  as  deterents  to  agents  who  may  be</span><span>  tempted  to  lend  themselves  to  promote</span><span>  corrupt  practices  In  some  cases  fine</span><span>  may  be  added  to  imprisonment  The</span><span>  definition  of  corrupt  practices  includes</span><span>  ""treating  in  all  its  forms,""  and  it  makes</span><span>  the  party  accepting  the  ""treat  ""  or  bribe</span><span>  a  partner  in  the  offence  Under  the</span></p> <p><span>  head  of  illegal  practices  is  included  the</span></p> <p><span>  conveyance  of  voters  to  and  from  the</span><span>  poll  the  payment  to  an  elector  of</span><span>  any  sum  of  money  for  posting  or  ex</span><span>  hibiting  bills  or  notices,  or  banners  on</span><span>  his  premises  attempting  to  procure  the</span><span>  vote  of  any  unqualified  person  The</span><span>  Bill  prohibits  the  hiring  of  any  com</span><span>  mittee  rooms,  m  excess  of  the  number</span><span>  which  the  bill  allows,  and  stipulates  that</span><span>  the  use  of  committee  rooms  in  public</span><span>  houses  shall  be  considered  as  an  offence,</span><span>  defined  as  illegal  hiring  Although  it  is</span><span>  perhaps  impossible  to  object  to  the  spirit</span><span>  and  intention  of  so  excellent  a  measure,</span><span>  some  difficulty  will  be  experienced  in</span><span>  making  it  immediately  operative  The</span><span>  conveyance  of  electors  to  the  polling</span><span>  station  has  long  been  illegal  m</span><span>  municipalities,  but  transgressions  in  this</span><span>  respect  are  so  popular  among  candidates</span><span>  friends,  as  to  be  disregarded  The</span><span>  better  state  of  diciphne  in  which  partizan</span></p> <p><span>  movements  are  conducted,  and  the  com-</span></p> <p><span>  pleteness  of  the  machinery  which  is  at  j</span></p> <p><span>  the  disposal  of  local  authorities  in  the</span><span>  old  country,  may  enable  them  to  give</span></p> <p><span>  effect  to  provisions,  which  would  never  I</span></p> <p><span>  take  effect  in  and  newer  and  less  settled  I</span><span>  state  of  society  to  which  we  are  ac-</span><span>  customed.  But,  as  already  hinted,  the</span><span>  process  of  educating  the  masses  to  a</span><span>  higher  electoral  tone,  must  take  years</span><span>  to  develope  into  such  a  state  of  purity</span><span>  as  that  sought  to  be  established  by  the</span><span>  measure,  now  before  the  Imperial</span><span>  Parliament.  The  endeavour  cannot,</span><span>  however,  but  command  the  active</span><span>  sympathy  of  all  classes  of  the</span><span>  community,  who  desire  to  see  the</span><span>  franchise  exercised  in  an  intelligent  man-</span><span>  ner,  by  those  who  are  in  possession  of  so</span><span>  valuable  a  right  of  citizenship.  Instead</span><span>  of  voters  requiring  to  be  solicited,  can-</span><span>  vassed,  circularized,  and  in  other  ways</span><span>  cajoled,  or  coaxed  to  give  their  votes;  and</span><span>  instead  of  their  being  required  to  be  en-</span><span>  ticed  or  conveyed  to  the  poll,  as  many  are</span><span>  at  present,  they  should  come  sponta-</span><span>  neously,  and  with  a  definite  intention  of</span><span>  supporting  measures  and  principles  by</span><span>  the  election  of  their  exponents.  The</span><span>  general  purpose  of  this  measure  is  indis-</span><span>  putably  to  guide  public  opinion  in  this</span><span>  direction,  and  if  its  provisions  make  the</span><span>  whipping  in,  and  the  conveyance,  and  the</span><span>  cajolery,  and  persuasion,  now  lavished</span><span>  upon  electors  impossible,  it  will  accom-</span><span>  plish  great  good.  The  exercise  of  voting</span><span>  power  should  be  spontaneous.  The  man</span><span>  who  requires  much  pressing  to  cast  his</span><span>  vote  should  be  regarded  as  not  taking</span><span>  sufficient  interest  in  the  questions  of  the</span><span>  day  to  make  his  opinion  upon  them  of</span><span>  any  value  to  the  community.  Should  the</span><span>  measure  become  law  it  will  undoubtedly</span><span>  increase  the  number  of  absentees,  but</span><span>  will  nevertheless  increase  the  value  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  decisions  of  the  constituencies.  Victory</span><span>  would  favour  the  party  whose  rank  and</span><span>  file  were  most  earnestly  impressed  with</span></p> <p><span>  the  wisdom  of  their  leaders  intentions,</span><span>  and  it  would  not  be  unreasonable  to  hope</span><span>  thal  by  this  means  a  very  beneficial  in</span><span>  fluence  would  be  exercised  upon</span><span>  the  representatives  of  the  people,</span><span>  who  would  not  be  slow  to  ap</span><span>  precíate  the  advantage  of  presenting</span><span>  to  electors,  hating  an  intelligent,  if  not  a</span><span>  critical  interest  in  the  party,  an  accs.pt</span><span>  able  programme,  capable  of  inspiring</span><span>  supporters  In  the  extension  of  a</span><span>  tendency  of  the  character  indicated  it  is</span><span>  surely  not  difficult  to  discover  a  strong</span><span>  corrective  to  the  disadvantages,  which  are</span><span>  frequently  supposed  to  arise  from  the</span><span>  adoption  of  universal  suffrage  If  there</span><span>  were  no  inducement  for  the  man,  who</span><span>  had  not  been  at  the  trouble  to  inform</span><span>  himself  upon  the  politics  of  the  day,</span><span>  and  form  a  definite  opinion  for  himself,</span></p> <p><span>  then  we  are  inclined  to  think  that  onlv</span><span>  those  active  politicians  would  present</span><span>  themselves,  who  were  sufficiently  per</span><span>  suaded  of  the  rectitude  of  their  convie</span><span>  lions  as  to  make  them  earnestly  desirous</span><span>  of  seeing  their  views  embodied  m  our</span><span>  statutes,  and  by  that  means  actively</span><span>  influencing  the  welfare  of  the  country</span></p> ",Article,1883-08-27,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  UOCKIIAMI'l'ON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  SEPTEMBER  3,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  the  paper  which  Mr.  Morris  read  at</span><span>  trie  meeting  of  the  Royal  Colonial  Insti-</span><span>  tute,  on  the  12th  June  last,  and  to  which</span><span>  :we  referred  last  week,  he  made  particular</span><span>  references  to,  what  he  called  the  minor</span><span>  industries  of  tropical  agriculture'.  Sugar</span><span>  cultivation  he  spoke  of  as  the  major</span><span>  industry.  Among  the  most  important</span><span>  of  the  former  are  the  production  of</span><span>  cacao  and  bananas.  These  thrive  in</span></p> <p><span>  exactly  the  same  circumstances,  and</span><span>  under  the  same  system  of  cultivation.</span><span>  They  are  planted  together,  and  the</span><span>  quickly  growing,  early  fruiting  bananas</span><span>  act  as  nurses  of  the  slower  growing,  but</span><span>  ultimately  more  remunerative  cacao.</span><span>  When  thc  banana  plants  have  become</span><span>  exhausted,  and  no  longer  yield  their</span><span>  bunche^  then  the  cacao  plants  begin  to</span><span>  bear,  and  the  ground,  cleared  of  inter-</span><span>  mediate  rows  of  the  former,  is  required</span><span>  for  the  latter.  Next  to  sugar,  coffee  and</span><span>  cacao  are  the  most  important  articles  of</span><span>  production  in  the  West  Indies.  In</span><span>  Trinidad,  25,188  acres  of  land  under</span><span>  cacao  yielded  a  gross  export  value  of</span><span>  ^270,906,  or  an  average  of  upwards  of</span><span>  £io  an  acre.  In  Jamaica,  again,</span><span>  22,853  acres  of  land  under  coffee  gave  a</span><span>  return  of  ,£271,449.  1°  '872  the</span><span>  value  of  the  cacao  exported  from</span><span>  Dominica  was  ¿¡2546  ;  and  six  years</span><span>  afterwards  it  had  risen  to  .^12,572.</span><span>  These  figures  merely  indicate  the</span><span>  rapidity  and  extent  with  which  trade  in</span><span>  these  articles  is  springing  up  in</span><span>  the  sunny  islands  of  the  wes-</span></p> <p><span>  tern  main.  But  there  are  other</span><span>  tropical  products,  which  yield  a  profitable</span><span>  return  on  the  labour  and  care  expended</span><span>  on  them.  Among  these  may  be  men-</span><span>  tioned  coco-nuts,  limes,  pineapples,</span><span>  mangoes,  oranges,  nutmegs,  cinchona,</span><span>  &c.  ""  A  coco  plantation,  we  are  told,</span><span>  in  the  West  Indies,  well  established  and</span><span>  in  full  bearing  (say  at  the  end  of  eight</span><span>  years)  with  sixty  trees  to  the  acre,  may</span><span>  be  safely  assumed  to  be  of  the  annual</span><span>  value  of  £io  an  acre.  The  expense</span></p> <p><span>  of  maintaining  a  coco-nut  plantation,</span><span>  when  once  established,  is  practically</span><span>  nothing  ;  hence  the  thousands  of  acres</span><span>  of  land  bordering  the  sea-coast  of</span><span>  our  West  India  possessions  are</span><span>  capable  of  immense  development.""</span><span>  Trie  general  price  for  coco-nuts  in  the</span><span>  West  Indies  varies  from  50s.  to  80s.  per</span><span>  thousand.  In  1880  the  value  of  nuts</span></p> <p><span>  exported  from  Jamacia  was  ,£20,500,</span><span>  and  from  Trinidad  £14,000.  The  fruit</span><span>  trade  of  the  islands  fosters  and</span><span>  strengthens  other  and  more  permanent</span><span>  industries.  The  cultivation  of  the</span><span>  banana,  for  instance,  enables  planters  to</span><span>  establish  cacoa.  The  fruit  trade  with</span><span>  America  has  become  a  settled  and</span><span>  promising  industry.  Pineapples,  tn  the</span><span>  natural  state  and  canned,  are  exported  in</span><span>  large  quantities.  Swift  steamers  are  now</span><span>  being  placed  on  the  routes  between</span><span>  the  richer  islands,  and  the  larger  coast</span><span>  towns  of  the  United  States,  for  the</span><span>  purpose  of  facilitating  the  trade  in</span><span>  coco-nuts,  bananas,  oranges,  pineapples,</span><span>  tamarinds,  plantains,  mangoes,  &c.  In</span><span>  1882  the  value  of  these  fruits  exported</span><span>  from  Jamaica  alone  reached  .¿138,359.</span><span>  In  1873-ten  years  ago-the  value  of</span><span>  the  fruits  shipped  from  Jamaica  was</span><span>  £8750.  The  demand  for  them  is  in-</span><span>  creasing;  the  wants  of  the  United  States</span><span>  and  Canada  cannot  be  supplied.  Among</span><span>  these  minor  agricultural  industries  the</span><span>  production  of  nutmegs,  cinnamon,  car-</span><span>  damoms,  cloves,  black  pepper,  and</span></p> <p><span>  vanilla  has  been  included.  The  cultiva-</span><span>  tion  of  cinchona  has  been  fostered  by</span><span>  the  Government  of  Jamaica  ;  and  at</span><span>  a  cost  of  £r6,ooo  they  have  made  an</span><span>  estate,  which  has  yielded  ¿£12,000,  and</span><span>  the  plantation  is  valued  at  £20,000.</span><span>  We  are  told-""Thc  cost  of  establish-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  cinchona  plantations  in  Jamaica  is</span><span>  estimated  at  ¿£35  per  acre,  which</span></p> <p><span>  includes  tbe  purchase  of  land,  and  all</span><span>  expenses  up  to  the  end  of  the  fourth</span><span>  year,  when  the  first  crop  of  bark  may  be</span><span>  taken.  The  total  yield  of  the  plantation</span><span>  (deducting  the  cost  of  barking,  curing,</span><span>  and  shipping  expenses)  up  to  the  end  of</span><span>  the  ninth  year,  will  probably  be  not  less</span><span>  than  ^175  per  acre,  against  an  outlay</span></p> <p><span>  for  planting  operations  ior  that  period  of  :</span><span>  about  ,£50  per  acre.  The  estimate  of</span><span>  cost  is  based  upon  land  at  about  5s.  an</span><span>  acre,  and  creole  labour  at  existing  rates</span><span>  -viz.:  men,  is.  to  is.  4j£d.  per'day  ;</span><span>  women,  loj^d.  to  is.  per  day.""  Be-</span><span>  sides  producing  cinchona,  the  manufac-</span><span>  ture  of  the  bark  into  a  febrifuge  has</span><span>  been  commenced,  with  every  prospect  of</span><span>  success,  as  there  is  a  great  demand  for</span><span>  the  article  among  the  fever  stricken</span><span>  inhabitants.  On  the  little  island  of</span><span>  Montserrat  a  lime  juice  manufactory  has</span><span>  been  established,  and  has  been  carried</span><span>  on  under  such  favourable  circumstances</span><span>  that  the  export  ot  the  article,  crude  and</span><span>  concentrated,  is  now  nearly  100,000</span><span>  gallons  per  annum.  On  the  lime</span><span>  plantation  1000  acres  are  planted  with</span><span>  20,000  trees  of  all  ages.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  agriculture  readers,  we  trust,  have</span><span>  anticipated  us  in  the  main  object  we</span><span>  have  in  view,  in  calling  attention  to  these</span><span>  facts.  It  is  to  point  out  the  capabilities</span><span>  of  tropical  agriculture  in  its  minor</span><span>  branches  as  a  profitable  industry.  There</span><span>  is  none  of  the  fruits  mentioned,  which</span><span>  cannot  be  grown  with  the  smallest</span><span>  amount  of  cultivation  in  this  colony.  In</span><span>  fact,  we  have  seen  limes  and  oranges</span><span>  growing  in  a  semi-wild  state.  There  can</span><span>  be  no  doubt  but  by  a  very  little  effort,</span><span>  we  could  establish  coco  plantations  on</span><span>  our  coast  lands  ;  that  cacao  and  bananas</span><span>  could  be  grown  together  as  in  the  West</span><span>  Indies  ;  coffee  is  already  being  success-</span><span>  fully  cultivated  ;  and  cinchona  has  been</span><span>  found  to  thrive  In  our  experimental  gar-</span><span>  dens.  Some  of  our  .readers  may</span><span>  be  ready  to  admit  at  once,  'that</span><span>  there  are  no  natural  obstacles</span></p> <p><span>  to:  the  cultivation  of  any  of</span><span>  the  products  referred  to  in  this</span><span>  colony,  but  where  could  they  find  a</span><span>  market  for  them.  We  at  once  reply</span><span>  in  the  southern  colonies,  including  Tas-</span></p> <p><span>  mania  and  New  Zealand.  We  see  no</span></p> <p><span>  reason  why  we  should  not  pay  for  the</span><span>  timber  and  grain  we  obtain  from  them,</span></p> <p><span>  with  our  luscious  and  tempting  fruits?""</span><span>  We  have  quick  steamers  running  to  and</span><span>  fro  along  the  east  coast  of  Australia.</span><span>  We  have  large  towns  in  the  adjoining</span><span>  colonies,  where  thîre  would  be  a  steady</span><span>  demand  for  oar  products,  could  we  only</span><span>  create  a  trade.  Let  there  be  production,</span><span>  and  distribution  is  sure  to  follow.

"<p><span>  KOCK  I  IA  MITON.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  SEPTEMBER  24,  1883.</span></p> <p><span>  AMONG  those  who  advocate  a  change</span><span>  in  our  system  of  land-leasing  and</span><span>  alienation,  it  is  contended  that  the</span><span>  management  of  the  public  estate  should</span><span>  not  be  left  lo  one  Minister.  A  Board</span></p> <p><span>  of  Commissioners,  it  has  been  suggested,</span><span>  should  be  appointed  to  assist  in  the</span><span>  letting  of  the  public  lands,  and  in  the</span><span>  collection  of  the  ¡revenue  lo  be  derived</span><span>  from  them.  It  seems  to  be  considered</span><span>  in  many  quarters  that  the  Minister  for</span><span>  Lands  has  too  much  power,  and  that</span><span>  things  are  sometimes  done  that  others</span><span>  uninterested  cannot  recognise  to  be  to  the</span><span>  public  advantage.  Of  course,  if  the</span><span>  Minister  for  Lands  is  to  be  subjected  lo</span><span>  a  sort  of  espionage  by  this  means,  it  will</span><span>  occur  to  many  that  other  Ministers</span><span>  should  be  placed  under  similar  super-</span><span>  vision.  In  this  way  we  have  raised  the</span><span>  larger  question  of  the  establishment  of</span><span>  what  may  be  called  Hoards  of  Control</span><span>  at  the  head  of  each  public  depart-</span><span>  ment.  A  good  deal  may  be  said</span><span>  in  support  of  such  arrangement.</span><span>  The  efficiency  of  such  boards  would</span><span>  depend  very  much  on  their  constitution.</span><span>  Were  they  composed  of  men  who  only</span><span>  held  oflicc  during  the  continuance  in</span><span>  office  of  the  party  from  whom  they</span><span>  derived  their  status  they  would,  as  Minis-</span><span>  ters  are  at  present,  be  a  ^ood  deal  in  the</span><span>  power  of  the  higher  permanent  officials.</span><span>  It  is  patent,  we  think,  to  members  of</span><span>  Divisional  Hoards,  of  Town  Councils,</span><span>  ¡ind  of  other  public  bodies,  thnt  a  gre.it</span><span>  deal  of  the  business  of  our  Departments</span><span>  is  done  by  foe  Under  Secretaries.  To</span><span>  appoint  men  (oliovernwent  boards,  who</span><span>  should  only  hold  office  foi  a  short  time,</span><span>  would  be  no  great  advantage.  On  the</span><span>  other  hand,  permanent  members  would</span></p> <p><span>  be  too  apt  to  usurp  the  functions  of</span><span>  government,  without  being  open  to  a</span><span>  ready  and  sufficient  check.  Boards,</span><span>  therefore,  in  which  the  majority  of</span><span>  the  members  mere'.y  should  hold  per-</span><span>  manent  appointments  would  be  most</span><span>  ,  efficient.  The  permanent  members</span></p> <p><span>  would  possess  the  requisite  amount  of</span><span>  technical  knowledge  of  details  to  enable</span></p> <p><span>  them  to  exercise  due  control  on  the  con-</span><span>  duct  of  the  officials  in  the  Department  ;</span><span>  while  the  transitory  members  would</span><span>  prevent  the  Board  becoming  too  inde-</span></p> <p><span>  pendent.</span></p> <p><span>  A  glane»  at  the  various  public  Depart-</span><span>  ments  will  show  that  others  of  them</span></p> <p><span>  might  be  more  benefitted  by  a  Board  of</span><span>  Control  than  that  of  the  Lands.  The</span><span>  amount  of  public  business  that  is</span><span>  supposed  to  be  under  the  control  of  the</span><span>  Colonial  Secretary  is  too  much  for  one</span><span>  man.  Embraced  in  this  department  are</span><span>  the  Immigration  service,  for  which  the</span><span>  vote  last  year  was  j£t%o,ooo  ;  the  police</span><span>  service,  including  magistrates,  clerks,</span><span>  and  constables;  the  management  of</span><span>  gaols,  reformatories,  hospitals,  asylums,</span><span>  volunteers,  &c.  It  goes  without  showing,</span><span>  we  think,  that  an  active  politician,  who</span><span>  has  to  guide  the  affairs  of  the  colony,</span><span>  who  has  to  waKh  the  run  of,  events  over</span></p> <p><span>  adjoining  colonies,  and  that  in  which  he</span><span>  is  interest^;  who  has  to  meet  Patlia</span><span>  mei1.,  'and  discuss  &lt;v.easures  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  first  importance  in  all  their  details,  !</span><span>  can  only  perform  the  duties  of  this</span><span>  office  in  a  perfunctory  manner.  In  the</span><span>  department  of  the  Attorney-General  the</span><span>  business  to  be  attended  to  is  all  of  one</span><span>  kind,  and  is  not  so  great  as  in  that  of</span></p> <p><span>  'ie  Colonial  Secretary  ;  but  a  council  of</span><span>  al  vice,  composed  of  judges  and  gentle-</span><span>  men  of  eminence  in  the  legal  profession,</span><span>  would  be  for  the  public  advantage  in</span><span>  many  cases.  Our  Educational  Depart-</span><span>  ment  is  annually  becoming  burdened</span><span>  with  a  large  amount  of  business,  while</span><span>  there  are  many  questions  connected  with</span><span>  education,  outside  ot  the  usual  routine,</span><span>  that  call  for  consideration.  In  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  cussing  the  latter,  and  determining</span><span>  points  of  general  management  the</span><span>  assistance  of  gentlemen  like  Bishop</span><span>  Hale  and  Rev.  C.  M'Culloch  would  be</span><span>  valuable.  The  relations  of  the  Treasury</span><span>  with  our  trade  and  commerce  are  so</span><span>  numerous  and  vital,  that  a  Board  of</span><span>  Trade  would  certaily  prove  useful.</span><span>  A  council  of  the  kind  suggested  is</span><span>  already  in  existence.  Captain  Heath</span><span>  is  Chairman  of  the  Marine  Board,</span><span>  and  four  gentlemen  hold  seats  on  it.  An</span><span>  increase  in  the  number  of  members  of</span><span>  this  Board  would  enable  it  to  deal  with</span><span>  all  matters  connected  with  shipping,  as</span><span>  well  as  customs,  and  excise.  In  the</span><span>  Lands  Department  the  business  is  not  so</span><span>  varied  as  in  some  of  the  others.  Most</span><span>  of  the  detail  business  is  done  by  the  land</span><span>  agents  and  commissioners  ;  and  it  does</span><span>  not  appear  to  us  the  necessity  fora  Board,</span><span>  in  connection  with  this  Department,  is  so</span><span>  prominent  as  with  some  of  the  others.</span><span>  More  than  any  other  would  the  advan-</span><span>  tages  of  a  Board  be  apparent  in  connec-</span><span>  tion  with  the  Works  Department.  Itis  too</span><span>  much  for  one  man  to  inaugurate  the  policy,</span><span>  and  determine  the  principles  on  which</span><span>  our  railway  traffic  shall  be  conducted,</span></p> <p><span>  and  at  the  same  time  attend  to  the  ad-</span><span>  ministration  of  the  countless  details  of</span></p> <p><span>  j  the  system.  It  has  been  proposed</span></p> <p><span>  to  establish  a  railway  board  in</span></p> <p><span>  Victoria.  Such  a  council  would  be</span></p> <p><span>  of  immense  utility  in  connection  with  our</span></p> <p><span>  j  Works  Department,  and  plenty  of  occupa-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  would  be  found  for  it,  even  though</span><span>  it  should  not  attend  to  the  business  con-</span><span>  nected  with  mining,  public  buildings,</span><span>  roads,  &c.  The  Board  of  Trade  might</span><span>  extend  its  deliberations  beyond  things</span><span>  connected  with  the  Treasurer's  Depart-</span><span>  ment  to  those  pertaining  to  the  Post  and</span><span>  Telegraph  Departments,  which  would</span></p> <p><span>  I  naturally  fall  to  be  considered  in  making</span></p> <p><span>  arrangements  for  facilitating  trade  and</span></p> <p><span>  commerce.</span></p> <p><span>  In  permitting  so  much  of  the  public</span><span>  business  to  be  transacted  by  permanent</span><span>  civil  servants,  there  is  a  danger  of  the</span><span>  country  suffering  from  ""  officialism.""</span><span>  I  Our  civil  servants  form  a  large  and  intel-</span></p> <p><span>  ligent  section  of  the  community.  They</span><span>  are  a  power  in  the  State.  Especially  is</span><span>  this  the  case  with  respect  to  school</span><span>  masters.  The  education  service  is  repre-</span><span>  sented  in  every  community,  and  when-</span><span>  ever  the  teachers'  interests  are  threatened</span><span>  they  immediately  defend  them  through</span><span>  the  Press.  In  America  the  complete</span><span>  change  of  officials  which  follows</span><span>  a  change  of  Government  is  at-</span><span>  tended  with  many  disadvantages,  in-</span><span>  cluding  the  avoidable  expenditure  of</span><span>  public  funds.  We  have  no  desire  that</span><span>  such  a  system  should  prevail  in  this</span><span>  colony.  In  the  United  Kingdom  the</span><span>  periodic  changes  in  the  heads  of  Depart-</span><span>  ments  have  been  attended  with  good</span></p> <p><span>  results:  and  the  same  have  followed  the</span></p> <p><span>  like  constitutional  practice  in  this</span><span>  colony.  It  is  a  question  worthy  of  con-</span><span>  sideration,  whether  we  should  not  go</span><span>  farther,  in  immitation  of  the  Imperial</span><span>  Government,  and  appoint,  at  least,</span><span>  Boards  of  Trade  and  Works.  This  might</span><span>  be  done  to  the  great  relief  of  the  Ministers</span><span>  interested,  to  the  benefit  of  the  public</span><span>  service,  and  to  the  advantage  of  the</span><span>  colony.</span></p> ",Article,1883-09-24,"The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON.
