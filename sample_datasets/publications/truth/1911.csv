To</span><span>  admit  that  it  is  permissible  to  treat  the</span><span>  origin  and  growth  of  human  society</span><span>  scientifically,  and  at  the  same  time  to</span><span>    exclude  scientific  forethought  and  pre-</span><span>  cision  when  dealing  with  the  inorganic</span><span>  universe  and  life,  is  simply  to  confine  the</span><span>  human  intellect  in  thought-proof  com-</span><span>  partments,  where  it  may    not  invade</span><span>    those  provinces  inhabited  by  our  pre-</span><span>    judices  and    superstitions.    The  mater-</span><span>  tal  universe,with  all  its  contents,  is  one</span><span>  harmonious  whole,  and  cannot  be  sep-</span><span>  arated,  therefore  a  philosophy  which</span><span>    treats  one  subject  rationally,  and  another</span><span>  subject  in    a  wholly  irrational  manner,</span><span>  cannot  be  otherwise  than  lopsided  and</span><span>  untrustworthy.  If  those  religious  con-</span><span>  ceptions  of    our    time  are  rational,  let</span><span>  them  be  proclaimed  from  the  housetops;</span><span>  if  irrational,  let    them  be  extinguished.</span><span>    The  main  structure  of  Christian  beliefs</span><span>  consists  of  the</span><span>    FOLLOWING  THEORIES,</span><span>  duly  and    daily  announced  as  divine</span><span>  truths  :  The  creation  of    matter,  the</span><span>  special  and  instantaneous  creation  of</span><span>  man,  his  fall,  and  redemption  by  the  sac-</span><span>  rifice  of  a  divine    being.    To    these</span><span>  theories  modern  science  gives  a  most</span><span>  emphatic  denial.  The  indestructibility</span><span>  and  eternity  of  matter,  and  the  conser-</span><span>  vation  of  energy,  is  a  commonplace</span><span>  truth  of  science.  The  truth  of  evolu-</span><span>  tion  is  now  everywhere  accepted;    even</span><span>    the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  is  said  to</span><span>  be  an  evolutionist.    Evolution,  says  Ed</span><span>  ward  Clodd,  traverses  the  fundamental</span><span>  dogmas  of  Christianity.    That  man  is  of</span><span>  anthropoid  stock  is  accepted  as  obvious,</span><span>  and  those  who  affect  to  ridicule  man's  de-</span><span>  scent  or  ascent  from  the  ape  are  intellec</span><span>  tually  allied  to  those  who  think    they</span><span>  have  answered  Socialism  when  they  have</span><span>  sufficiently  ridiculed  what  they  call  ""div-</span><span>  iding  up.""      Instead  of  discovering  de</span><span>  fects  in  evolution  and  Socialism,    they</span><span>  merely  show  their  own  mental  vacuity,</span><span>    and  intellectual    barrenness.  To  com-</span><span>  plete  the  rout  of  orthodox  Chrlstlanlty,</span><span>  there  is  abundant  proof  that  man  has  ex-</span><span>  isted  in  his  present  physical  form  for</span><span>  hundreds  of  thousands  of  years;  indeed,</span><span>  authorities  like  Lewis  Morgan  and  Grant</span><span>  Allen  consider  one  million  years,  as  the</span><span>  minimum  years  of  his  existence.  As  the</span><span>    fall  of  man  is  therefore  a  fable,  so  is  the</span><span>  story  of  his  redemption,  and    the  whole,</span><span>  structure  of  Christian  belief  is  utterly</span><span>  and</span><span>  WHOLLY  UNTENABLE.</span><span>  If  it  is  any  comfort  to  those  of  the</span><span>    Labor  crowd  of  the  Keir  Hardie-Ramsay</span><span>  Macdonald  type,  it  may  be  added  that</span><span>    the  most  prominent  antagonists  of  Chris-</span><span>  tianity  have  also  been  antagonistic  to</span><span>  Socialism;  viz.,  Herbert  Spencer,  Inger-</span><span>  soll,  and  Bradlaugh.    The  Laborite  will,</span><span>  on  no  condition,  antagonise  Mother</span><span>  Church  and  her  rebellious  Protestant</span><span>  children:  he  might  lose  some  votes,  you</span><span>  know,  and  he  is  nothing  if  not  Opportun</span><span>  ist.  But  It  will  be  said  that  whilst  ad-</span><span>  mitting  the  creed  of  Christianity,  It  can-</span><span>  not  endure  nor  survive  rational  investi-</span><span>  gation,  yet  the  moral  code  of  Christian-</span><span>  ity  justifies  and  sanctions  the    claims  of</span><span>  Socialism.  To  begin  with;  Buckle,  In  his</span><span>  admirable  ""History  of  Civilisation.""  af-</span><span>    firms  there  is  not  one  new  or  original</span><span>  precept  in  the  whole  range  of  Christian</span><span>  morals.  Does  any  man  believe  the  Ser-</span><span>    mon  on  the  Mount  is  workable?  indeed,</span><span>  he  -must  conclude,  with  a  late  Archbishop</span><span>  of  York  that  it  is  impracticable.  We  all</span><span>  know  the  deplorable  condition  Tolstoi</span><span>  brought  himself  to  by  trying  to  practice</span><span>  Christ's  Christianity.    The  reason,  such</span><span>    impossible  code  of  morals  have  suv-</span><span>  vived  to  our  day  is  simply  and  solely  be-</span><span>  cause  the  man  who  delivered  them  was</span><span>  to  be  divine.    Not  one  Chris-</span><span>  tian  nation,  past  or  present,  and  but  few</span><span>  individuals  have  ever  attempted  to  prac-</span><span>  tice  the  precepts  of  the  Sermon  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  Mount.  Yet  the  Sermon  is  rational,  if</span><span>  we  admit  the  hypothesis  upon  which</span><span>    IT    IS  FOUNDED.</span><span>  The  underlying  belief  is—  there  exists  a</span><span>  Heavenly  Father  Who  even    takes  into</span><span>    account  the  existence  of.  the  humble  spar-</span><span>  row;  to  Whom  even  the  very  hairs  of  our</span><span>  head'  are  numbered.  Being  omniscient.</span><span>  He  is  also  omnipotent,  and  can,  if  neces</span><span>  sary,  turn  stones  Into  bread,  which  is  no</span><span>  surprise  to  those  who  believe  He  created</span><span>  matter  out  of  nothing.    Once  grant  the</span><span>  existence  of  a  Being  having  such    at-</span><span>  tributes,    and  it  justifies  the  most  im</span><span>  plicit  and  childlike  confidence  in  the  most</span><span>  Impracticable  precept  imaginable.    Ra</span><span>  tional  ethics  require  no  inspired  author</span><span>  they  are  obvious  and  practicable,  but  an</span><span>  ethical  code  antagonistic    alike  to  human</span><span>  nature  and  social  aspirations  can    only</span><span>  survive  by  reason  of  belief  In    its  false</span><span>  foundation.    Therefore,  when  men  are</span><span>  enlightened  enough  to  overthrow  the  God</span><span>  theory,  they  must  needs  overthrow  such</span><span>  moral  precepts,  as  are  obviously  founded</span><span>  on  it.</span><span>  Therefore,  to    assert  that  the  ethics  of</span><span>  Christianity    are  identical  to  those  of</span><span>  Socialism,  is  to  seriously  detract  from  the</span><span>  scientific  concept  of  the  latter:  to  imply</span><span>  it  is  untrue  to  nature  and    fact,  and,  in</span><span>  one  word,  it  is  impracticable.    As  scien-</span><span>  tific  Socialists,  we  emphatically  deny</span><span>    there  is  any  connection  between  Socialism</span><span>  and  Christianity,  other  than  there  is  be</span><span>  tween  say,    Socialism  and  Anarchism.</span><span>  The  anarchist  strongly  condemns  capi</span><span>  talist  society  but  his  remedy,  like  that  of</span><span>  the  Christian,  is  poles  asunder  from  that</span><span>  proposed  by  Socialists.  '  In  fact,  anar</span><span>  chists  claim  Jesus,  as</span><span>  OF  THEIR  BELIEF.</span><span>  Your  correspondent  differs  from  many</span><span>  authorities  when  he  claims    the  New  Tes</span><span>  tament  as  more  socialistic  than  the  Old</span><span>  Testament.    Lecky  says  that  reformers,</span><span>  as  a  rule,  drew  their  inspiration  from  the</span><span>  outspoken  prophets  of  the    Old  Testa</span><span>  ment.  The  New  Testament,  excepting  a</span><span>  few  ambiguous  passages,  distinctly  favors</span><span>  submission  to  earthly  authority,  which</span><span>  might  be  expected,  considering  the    over-</span><span>  whelming  power  of    Rome,    which  pre</span><span>  cluded  national  or  patriotic  fervor.    It</span><span>  was  therefore  eminently  favorable  for  the</span><span>  growth  of  the  ascetic  spirit  and  super-</span><span>  naturalism,  and  consequently  detrimental</span><span>  to  social  progress.  The  shadow  of  Rome</span><span>  darkened  the  human  intellect,  and,  failing</span><span>  relief  in  the  visible  and  real  world,    it</span><span>  sought  relief  in  the  unreal  world  of    dis-</span><span>  eased  imagination.</span><span>  To  conclude,  then,  Socialism,  can  have</span><span>  no  connection  with  dogmatic  Christian-</span><span>  ity,  with,  the  creeds  of    the  churches,  be-</span><span>  cause  they,  are  totally  unscientific  and</span><span>  unsound.  As  a  large  part  of  Christian</span><span>  ethics  is  founded    on  those  same  dogmas,</span><span>  they  are  equally  unsound.    As  regards</span><span>  the  inorganic  universe  and  the  origin  of</span><span>    life,  Socialism  is  in  complete  accord  with</span><span>  modern  science,    and  is  materialistic.</span><span>  What  Spencer  and  Darwin  accomplished</span><span>  in  regard  to  the  last,  mentioned  subjects,</span><span>  Marx  accomplished  in  his  analysis  of</span><span>    human  society.

Sir</span><span>  Thomas  Brassey  was  the  son  of  a  great</span><span>  railway  contractor,  who  had  been  In  the</span><span>  1  habit  of  making  accurate  comparisons  of</span><span>  the  value  of  the  work  of  different  men,'</span><span>  and  In  writing  his  book  ""  Foreign  Work</span><span>  and  English  Wages,""  he  made  extensive</span><span>  use  of  his  father's  notes.  He  showed,</span><span>  that  English  navvies  employed  upon  the</span><span>  Grand  Trunk  Hallway  In  Canada,  and</span><span>  receiving  from  five  shillings  to  six  shil</span><span>  lings  a  day,  did  a  greater  amount  of  work</span><span>  for  the  money  than  the  French  Cana</span><span>  dians,  who  were  willing  to-  accept  three</span><span>  shillings  or  three  shillings  and  sixpence</span><span>  a  day.  He  further  showed,  to  his  dwn</span><span>  satisfaction  —  although  stay-Rt-borne</span><span>  Faddy,  l:i  his  affection  for  his-  potato</span><span>  diet,  may  Indignantly  deny  It—  that  It</span><span>  was  more  profitable  to  employ  EngUlh-</span><span>  men  at  three  shillings  or  three  shillings</span><span>  and  sixpence  a  day  upon  making  Irish</span><span>  railways  than  Irishmen  at  one  shilling</span><span>  and  sixpence  to  one  and  elghtpence.

Surely  the  advocates  of  cheap</span><span>  BLACK  LABOR  '</span><span>  never  received  a  harder  s'ap  In  argu</span><span>  ment.  Brassey  goes  on  to  tell  that  In</span><span>  quarry  work  In  which  Frenchmen,  Irish</span><span>  men.  and  Englishmen  were  employed  side</span><span>  by  side,  the  Frenchman  received  thre'e.</span><span>  the  Irishman  four,  and  the  Englishman</span><span>  six  francs  u  day,  and  that  at  those  dif</span><span>  ferent  'rates  the-  Englishman  was  found</span><span>  to  be  the  most  advantageous,  workman</span><span>  of  the  three.  Brassey,  in  publishing</span><span>  these  conclusions,  did  not  so  much  insult</span><span>  the  Irish  as  shew  that  In  comparison  to</span><span>  the  English,  they  had  been  accustomed</span><span>  to  an  insufficient  diet,  and  that  poverty,</span><span>  with  Its  meagre  cupboards.  Is  not  likely</span><span>  to  produce  a  satisfactory  type  of  work</span><span>  man.  Brassey  showed,  too,  that  in  the</span><span>  United  States,  where  the  rate  of  wages</span><span>  in  some  trades  was  higher  than  In  Eng</span><span>  land.  more  or  better  work,  was  done.  It</span><span>  has  been  argued  that  he  derived  his</span><span>  conclusions  from  a  study  of  men  engaged</span><span>  in  heavy  manual  labor  only,  and  that</span><span>  they  could  not  he  accepted  -as  a  guide  to</span><span>  the  economic  value  of  high  wages  In  all</span><span>  industries;  but  an  effective  reply  to  this</span><span>  argument  has  been  supplied  by  an  ex</span><span>  pert  comparison  between  England  and</span><span>  the  United  States  as  regards  the  pre</span><span>  sent  condition  of  the  cotton  Industry.</span><span>  Wages  paid  to  weavers  In  America  are</span><span>  still  much  higher  than  those  paid  In</span><span>  England,  but  apparently  the  highly-paid</span><span>  American  labor  Is  so  much  more  elliclent</span><span>  than  the  English  that  the  cost  of  pro</span><span>  duction  Is'  actually  lower  In  America.</span><span>  Much  more  might  be'  written  to  show</span><span>  that  by  Increasing  wages  and  shortening</span><span>  working-hours  (thus  Increasing  the  stand</span><span>  ard  of  comfort)  the  employer  g«lns  as  a</span><span>  result  of  Increased  efficiency  of  labor,</span><span>  but  further  enlargement  of  the  argument</span><span>  seems  unnecessary.

His  duties</span><span>  had  been  to  collect  money,  take  photo-</span></p> <p><span>  graphs,  and  numerous-  other  things.  He</span><span>  had  '  been  overworked,  and  liad  com</span><span>  plained  frequently,!  but  had  kept  on  In</span><span>  the  position  because  he  was  Interested</span><span>  In  the  work.  Hi  had  en_d!fferent  occa</span><span>  sions  called  the.'dttenllon  of  different</span><span>  managers  to  the  fact  that  his  cash  was</span><span>  either  over  or  under.  .The  cash-book,  he</span><span>  stated,  showed  the  cash  -was  £4  over  In</span><span>  December  last,  and  that  amount  had  been</span><span>  paid  Into  the  bank.</span><span>  Cliff  declared  that  there  had  been  ab</span><span>  solutely  no  intention  on  his  part  to  steal</span><span>  the  £8  14s.,  and  none  of  the  amount  had</span><span>  been  converted  to  his  own  use.  His</span><span>  cash'  had  evidently  been  mixed  up  when</span><span>  he  went  .  to  the  bank,  and  he  paid  the</span><span>  cheque  in  to  square  matters,  for  the  time</span><span>  being.  In  September,  the  accused  said</span><span>  Firth's  account  was  £1  19s.

In  giving  Judgment  oo  the</span><span>  subject,  said</span><span>  One  of  the  particulars  given  Is  ""that</span><span>  .

In  addition,  there</span><span>  would  be  the  trial  of  a  man  In  proceed</span><span>  ings  to  which  he  Is  not  a  party  and  In</span><span>  respect  of  which  he  lias  no  voice  or</span><span>  control.  The  real  question  with  re</span><span>  spect  to  these  .  charges  relates  to  the</span><span>  '  plaintiff's  knowledge  and  motives  In  re-</span><span>  -  spect  thereto  (I  am  advisedly  using</span><span>  general  words),  and  plaintiff  does  not</span><span>  desire  to  test  the  matter  except  in  re</span><span>  gard  to  his  connection  and  dealing  with</span><span>  the  charges.  In  these  circumstances,</span><span>  I  think  I  should  order  the  paragraph  to</span><span>  be  struck  out,  with  liberty  to  amend  in</span><span>  the  direction  Indicated!</span><span>  Defendant  appealed  against  that  order</span><span>  to  the  State  Full  Court,  which,  however,</span><span>  dismissed  the  appeal  on  tho  ruling  of  Mr.</span><span>  Justice  a'Beckett  and  Mr.  Justice  Hood,</span><span>  the  Chief  Justice  (Sir  John  Madden)  dis</span><span>  senting.  The  motion  for  leave  to  appeal</span><span>  .to  the  High  Court  ot  Australia  was  the</span><span>  outcome.</span><span>  The  latter  Court  consisted  of  Chief  Jus</span><span>  tice  Sir  Samuel  Griffith,  ;Mr.  Justice</span><span>  O'Connor,  Mr.  Justice  Barton,  Mr.\  Jus</span><span>  tice  Hlgglns,  and  Mr.  Justice  Isaacs.</span><span>  Mr.  Starke,  after  stating  the  prelimin</span><span>  aries,  as  set  out  above,  explained  that  de</span><span>  fendant's  plea  was  a  composite  one  of</span><span>  justification  and  fair  comment.  vl2..  that</span><span>  his  comments  were  true  so  far  as  they</span><span>  consisted  of  facts,  and  were  fair  so  far</span><span>  as  they  consisted  of  comment.  The  al</span><span>  leged  libel  substantially  asserted  that</span><span>  Canon  Nosh  was  innocent  of  certain</span><span>  charges  that  had  been  suggested  against  j</span><span>  him,  and  that  Archbishop  Clarke  was</span><span>  In  charge  of  the  diocese  In  which  Canon</span><span>  Nash  was  located.  The  artlclethen  pre-</span><span>  .ceeded  to  show  that-.the  plaintiff  was</span><span>  jealous  of  Canon  Nash's.  position.  In  the.</span><span>  Church,  and,  although  he  knew  him  to</span><span>  be  innocent,  set  to  work  to  deliberately</span><span>  ruin  him  and  have  him.  removed  from  the</span><span>  Church.  The  length  and  discursive  na</span><span>  ture  of  the  article  compelled  defendant  to</span><span>  plead  a  composite  plea  of  justification  and</span><span>  fair  comment,  and  it  was  necessary  that</span><span>  he  should  be  allowed  to  prove  that  Canon</span><span>  'Nash  was  not  guilty  of  the  charges  that</span><span>  had  been  preferred  against  him,  and  that</span><span>  Archbishop  Clarke  was  aware  of  his</span><span>  Innocence.  Particulars  given  In  the</span><span>  statement  of  defence  on  that  Important</span><span>  subject  had  been  struck  out.  and  defen</span><span>  dant  considered'  it  essential  to  him  that</span><span>  they  should  be  retained.</span><span>  Mr.  Justice  O'Connor:  How  were  the</span><span>  'charges  against  Canon  Nash  dealt  with?</span><span>  Mr.  Starke:  There  appears  to  have</span><span>  been,  in  the  first  Instance,  some  allegedly</span><span>  friendly  arbitration,  and  It  was  suggested</span><span>  that  Canon  Nash  should  resign.  He  sent</span><span>  In  his  resignation  accordingly.  There,</span><span>  were  subsequent  developments,  and  he</span><span>  was  re-licensed  and  given  another  cure,</span><span>  but  not  in  the  same  diocese.</span><span>  '  Counsel  then  proceeded  to  refer  their</span><span>  Honors  te  specific  paragraphs  in  the</span><span>  pleadings.</span><span>  Mr.  Justlce  Hlgglns:  Are  the.  particu</span><span>  lars  now  .  before  us  amended  in  accord</span><span>  ance  with  Mr.  Justice  Cussen's  order?</span><span>  Mr.  Starke:  No:  paragraph  27,  which</span><span>  declares  that  Canon  Nash  was  not  guilty</span><span>  of  any  of  the  charges  laid  against  him</span><span>  by  the  plaintiff,  was  slightly  amended  by</span><span>  the  addition  of  the  words,  ""and  the</span><span>  plaintiff  was  aware  .  of  such  fact,""  but</span><span>  -the  learned  Judge  had  refused  to  accept</span><span>  that  amendment,  and  still  struck  It  out.</span><span>  !  Mr.  Justice  Isaacs:  AH  you  now  want</span><span>  Is  to  be  allowed  to  retain  the  paragraph</span><span>  as  amended.</span><span>  Mr.  Starke:  Yes:  that  Is  all.'</span><span>  The  Chief  Justice:  But  you  have  liberty</span><span>  to  amend.  When  the  learned  Judge</span><span>  struck-  it  out  he  gave  you#  liberty  »o</span><span>  amend.  You  are  allowed  to  prove  Canon</span><span>  Nash's  Innocence  so  far  as  the  plaintiff</span><span>  Jcnew  of  It.  What  is  objected  to  la'thet,</span><span>  under  the  paragraph  as  it  stands,  you</span><span>  might  call  evidence  to  establish  Canon</span><span>  Nash's  Innocence,  -  and  ;  then  say.  ""  We</span><span>  can't  say  whether  the  Archbishop  knew</span><span>  about  It  or  not.""</span><span>  Air.  Starke:  The  alleged  libel  declares</span><span>  that  Canon  Nash  is  an  innocent  man,</span><span>  and,  knowing  him  to  be  Innocent,  the</span><span>  plaintiff  prosecuted  hlni,  and  endeavored</span><span>  to  ruin  him.</span><span>  The  Chief  Justice:  But  the  only  evi</span><span>  dence  admissible  would  be  as  to  what</span><span>  the  Archbishop  knew.  ,</span><span>  Air.  Starke:  We  wish  to  first  prove  that</span><span>  Mr.  Nash  was  innocent,  and  then  proceed</span><span>  to  show1  that  the  Archbishop  knew  he  was</span><span>  Innocent.  TUt  Is  the  only  way  we  can</span><span>  prove  our  case..  It  would  be  Impossible</span><span>  to  prove  conclusively  that  the  Archbishop</span><span>  knew  Canon  Nash  was  Innocent  unless  we</span><span>  first  prove  that  he  (Canon  Nash)  was.  In</span><span>  fact,  innocent.</span><span>  The  Chief  Justice:  Proving  Canon</span><span>  Nash's  Innocence,  without  proving  the</span><span>  plaintiffs  knowledge,  might  cause  the</span><span>  procedure  of  the  Court  to  be  subverted.</span><span>  Sir.  Starke:  The  Judge  at  the  trial</span><span>  would  see  to  that.  If  we  are  not  al</span><span>  lowed  to  prove  Canon  Nash's  innocence,</span><span>  we  have  half  the  ground  of  our  defence</span><span>  cut  away.  -  .  ,</span><span>  The  Chief  Justice:  The  only  question</span><span>  Is,  ""  What  did  plaintiff  know?""</span><span>  Mr.  Starke:  Suppose  we  are  prepared  to</span><span>  show  that  the  plaintiff  received  tetters</span><span>  declaring  Canon  Nash  .to  be  innocent,  we</span><span>  would  be  precluded  from  proving  those</span></p> <p><span>  declarations  to  be  true,  if  the  Archbishop</span><span>  said,  ""  I  never  believed  the  contents  of</span><span>  such  letters,  and  did  not  recognise  the</span><span>  de&lt;daratlons  of  those  that  wrote  them.""</span><span>  Yet  that  fa  the  only  way  defendant  could</span><span>  prove  plaintiff  knew  certain  facts.  i</span><span>  Mr.  Justice  Hlgglns:  How  would  It  do</span><span>  to  amend  your  particulars  by  limiting</span><span>  them  to  ""at  all  times,  material""  the</span><span>  Archbishop  was  aware  of-  Canon  Nash's</span><span>  Innocence?</span><span>  Mr.  Starke:  That  would  answer  If  plain</span><span>  tiff  admits  that  Canon  Nash  was.  inno-</span><span>  cent,.or  if  we  are  allowed  to.  prove  as  a</span><span>  fact  that  he  was  innocent.  .  Once  estab</span><span>  lish  the  .innocence,  and  proof  of  Arch</span><span>  bishop  Clarke's  knowledge  would  follow..</span><span>  ,:The_  Chief  Justice/""  Td  what  extent?,  '</span><span>  '  Mr/starke:  To  the  full  extent.</span><span>  The  Chief  Justice:  To  the  extent  of  his</span><span>  knowledge?-</span><span>  Mr.  Starke:  The  order  as  it  stands  says</span><span>  we  may  only  prove  certain  facts  that  the</span><span>  plaintiff  knew.  The  plaintiff  might  say</span><span>  he  had.  been  Informed  of  certain  things</span><span>  he  did  not  believe.  We  say  he  should</span><span>  have  ascertained  the  truth  of  tbose</span><span>  things,  but  how  can  we  say  that  to  the</span><span>  jury  unless  we  prove  that  tbey  are  true?</span><span>  Suppose  a  letter  was  written  to  the</span><span>  Archbishop  alleging  that  Canon  Nash  was</span><span>  In  India  at  the  time  he  was  alleged  to</span><span>  have  committed  an  offence  In  England,</span><span>  anil  the  Archbishop  contented  himself</span><span>  with  saying,  ""  I  did  not  believe  It,""  are</span><span>  we  not  entitled  -to  call  evidence  to  show</span><span>  that,  as  a  fact.  Canon  Nash  was  in  In</span><span>  dia,  and  the  Archbishop  could  easily  have</span><span>  ascertained  that  such  was  the  case?  That</span><span>  Is  the  only  way  Air.  Norton  can  prove  his</span><span>  plea—  by  first  proving  a  fact,  and  then</span><span>  proving'  that  the  fact  bad  been  communi</span><span>  cated  to  the  plaintiff.  If  It  is  proved</span><span>  that  the  Archbishop  was  given  Informa</span><span>  tion  as  to  Canon.  Nash's  innocence,  and</span><span>  did  not  act  upon/ft,  such  negligence  on</span><span>  his  part  supports  defendant's  plea  of  fair</span><span>  comment.'  The  basts  of  the  whole  of  de</span><span>  fendant's  fair  comment  Is  Canon  Nash's</span><span>  Innocence.  Defendant  says  to  plaintiff,</span><span>  ""  Here-  Is  an  Innocent  man;  you  attack</span><span>  blm;  and  I  charge  you  with  corruption.""</span><span>  The  Chief  Justice:  Yes.  as  regards  fair</span><span>  comment  on  plaintiffs  conduct,  but  how</span><span>  does  the  fact  of  Canon  Nash,  being  in</span><span>  nocent  affect  It?</span><span>  Air.  Starke:  Because  of  what  the  plain</span><span>  tiff  knew.  An  Innocent  man  was  prose</span><span>  cuted  by.  plaintiff,  who  attempted,  on</span><span>  charges  defendant  says  are  false,  to  re</span><span>  move  hfm  from  the  church.  Proof'  of  the</span><span>  Innocence  of  Canon  Nash  is  absolutely  es</span><span>  sential  to  defendant's  plea.  His  whole</span><span>  plea'  Is  based  upon  It.</span><span>  Air.  Justice  Barton:  It  only  amounts  to</span><span>  this  —  Canon  Nash  was  prosecuted,  and</span><span>  '  Canon  Nash  was  not  guilty.</span><span>  Air.  Starke:  It  is  necessary  to  prove</span><span>  that  Air.  Norton  knew  that  Archbishop</span><span>  Clarke  knew  that  Canon  Nash  was  in.</span><span>  nocent.-</span><span>  ,  :  AIr._  .Ins  tic.  Isaacs  V  You  are  not  pre</span><span>  vented,  from  proceeding  with  your  plea.</span><span>  Air.  Starke:  Yes.  because  we  will  be  de</span><span>  barred  from  supplying  particulars  of  facts</span><span>  on  which  we  intend  to  rely.  Of  course,</span><span>  we  wilt  still  have  our  rigLt  of  appeal  after</span><span>  the  trial,,  but  it  Is  better  to  settle  the</span><span>  question  new  than  afterwards.</span><span>  The  Chief  Justice:  The  only  question</span><span>  is  as  to  whether'the  Archbishop  believed</span><span>  Air.  Nash  to  be  guilty.</span><span>  Air.  Starke:  But  we  want  to  prove  the</span><span>  material  the  Archbishop  had  before  him</span><span>  supporting  Canon  Nasb's  innocence,  and</span><span>  to  show  that  the  material  comprised  facts</span><span>  which  the  Archbishop  should  have  veri</span><span>  fied.</span><span>  The  Chief  Justice:  The  order  of  Air.</span><span>  Justice  Cussen  restricts  you  to  proving</span><span>  what  Archbishop  Clarke  knew,  and  that</span><span>  is  what  you  wish  to  do.</span><span>  Mr.  .  Starke:  We  want  to  prove  he  had</span><span>  knowledge,  and  that  the  knowledge,  as</span><span>  regards  facts,'  was  accurate.  .  It  is  all</span><span>  Important  to  defendant  that  the  facts</span><span>  should  be  proved.  It  would  not  be  suffi</span><span>  cient  to  show  that  plaintiff  knew  things,</span><span>  without  proving  that,  tbose  things  were</span><span>  true.  '  ,</span><span>  Air.  Justice  Isaacs  quoted  the  remarks</span><span>  made  by  Mr.'  Justice  a'Beckett,  viz.:—'</span><span>  Defendant's  counsel,  in  effect,  said:—</span><span>  ""  We  have  here  two  statements,  one</span><span>  that  Canon  Nash!  Is  Innocent,  and  the</span><span>  other  that  plaintiff  was  aware  of  his</span><span>  innocence.  We  are  relying  on  the</span><span>  point  as  to'  his  innocence,  and  we  may.</span><span>  or  may  not  prove  that  plaintiff  was</span><span>  aware  of  his  innocence—  that  Is  Imma</span><span>  terial.  .  .  ,""  The  learned  Judge  was</span><span>  right  -In'  saying,  ""I  won't  allow  this</span><span>  double  statement  of  two&lt;  matters  which</span><span>  are  entirely  different.  .  .  but  the</span><span>  learned  Judge  does  not  mean  to  ex</span><span>  clude'  proofs  of  the  fact'  that  the  plain</span><span>  tiff  had  knowledge  of  Canon  Nash's  in</span><span>  nocence.  He  doesn't  suggest  for  a  mo</span><span>  ment  that  they  should  be  excluded.  He</span><span>  says,  ""I  won't  have  such  a  statement</span><span>  of  defendant's  case  as  wilt  make  the</span><span>  Innocence,  and  the  plaintiffs  know-</span><span>  ""  ledge  ef  the  Innocence,  of  Canon  Nash</span><span>  each  a  substantive  allegation,""</span><span>  Air.  Starke:  It  is  simply  an  allegation</span><span>  with  two  steps.</span><span>  The  Chief  Justice:  If  you  proved  every</span><span>  thing  as  to  Canon  Nash's  Innocence,  and</span><span>  then  failed  lo  connect  Archbishop  Clarke</span><span>  with  what  you  had  proved,  you  would</span><span>  prejudice  the  jury.</span><span>  Air.  Starke:  You  must  .  remember  we</span><span>  would  not  be  allowed  by  the  Court  to  do</span><span>  an  improper  thing  at  the  triaL</span><span>  The  Chief  Justice:  But  'you  want  to</span><span>  prove  something  Irrelevant  first,  and  then</span><span>  try  to  connect  it  afterwards  with  some</span><span>  thing  that  Is  revelant.</span><span>  Air.  Starke:  We  will  endeavor  to  prove</span><span>  both  steps  In  our  allegation.

The  libel</span><span>  is  In  the.  allegation  that  the  Archbishop</span><span>  prosecuted  Canon  Nash,  knowing  him  to</span><span>  be  Innocent.

You  must  prove  knowledge,  and</span><span>  knowledge  is  alone  material.  Any  Judge</span><span>  would  exclude  evidence  unless  connected</span><span>  with  the.  accused  person's  knowledge.  You</span><span>  want  to  be  allowed  to  depart  from  that</span><span>  principle,  and  give  evidence  Irrespective</span><span>  of-  the  plaintiff's,  knowledge.  The.  learned</span><span>  Judge's  order  gives  you  the  right  to  prove</span><span>  all  you  are  entitled  to  prove,</span><span>  Mr.  Starke:  No;-  the  form  of  the  par</span><span>  ticulars  as  defined  by  that  order  does  not</span><span>  give  us  the  right  to  prove  all  that  we</span><span>  ore  entitled  to  prove.

Justice  Isaacs:  You  can't  be  sued  for</span><span>  saying  Canon  Nash  Is  an  Innocent  man,</span><span>  and  you  have  no  need  to  justify  that</span><span>  Air.  Starke:  Why  does  not  plaintiff  ad-</span><span>  rait  be  is  an  innocent  man?  That  would</span><span>  end  the  difficulty.  As  the  order  stands,</span><span>  we  are  precluded  from  proving  his  inno</span><span>  cence,  but  plaintiff  could  proceed  to  prove</span><span>  him  guilty.  .  The  Archbishop  might  say,</span><span>  ""  Your  .facts  are  wrong.  The  man  was.</span><span>  guilty  of  the  charges  I  preferred  against</span><span>  him.""

Our  statement  Is  that</span><span>  Canon  Nash  was  Innocent,  and  our  com</span><span>  ment-is  based'  on  that.  .Should  not  the</span><span>  Jury  be.  asked—</span><span>  The  Cblef-  Jjistice:_-The  Jury  would  be</span><span>  misled.  ;  ;  '</span><span>  Mr.  Justice  Hlgglns  said  the  innocence</span><span>  or  guilt  of  Canon  Nash  was  not  material.</span><span>  Air.

Dear  Sirs,—  Mrs.  Waller,  of  Wheeler's</span><span>  .-Rill,  has  shown  roc  a  letter  she  has  re</span><span>  ceived  from  'your  firm  with  reference  to</span><span>  ;lber  youngest  daughter,  and  unknown  to</span><span>  her  I  am  replying  to  part  of.  it.

The</span><span>  'bachelor  referred  to  is  my  manager,  and</span><span>  Sf  I  had  children  that  I  wished-  to  leave</span><span>  in  chargo  of  'someone,  he  is  tuo  man  I</span><span>  would  select.  The  child  is  a  delicate  one;</span><span>  tiiat  in  appearance  looks  about  iriue  years</span><span>  i  old,  and  I  believe  sbo  is  twelve.  She  re-</span><span>  JL  .quires  all'  the  oiitdoor  life  she  can  get,  and</span><span>  -P.  has  a  pony  to'ride  to  and  fro,  lont  to  her</span><span>  a  friend  of  mine.  I  have  no  hesitation</span><span>  in  saying  that  i£  the  girl  were  taken  to</span><span>  4own,  and  from  her  mother,  she  would  not</span><span>  '  »  Siva  twelve  months.

The  fact  ap</span><span>  pears  to  be  that  so  sick  and  sorry  is</span><span>  the  average  >tepayer  that  hope  has  no</span><span>  place  in  the  sphere  of  local  government.</span><span>  Barnacle  ilcBumble  seems  tp  revel  in</span><span>  that  fact,  .because  it  is  the  basis  of  his</span><span>  existence,  the  breath  of  his  nostrils,  the</span><span>  .very  wine  of  his  log-rolling  life.  Hence,</span><span>  at  a  time  like  tiffs,  when,  far  and  wide,</span><span>  the  land  should  be  astir  with  municipal</span><span>  activity,  Instead  of  n  vigorous  and  deter</span><span>  mined  'assault  on  the  fastnesses  of  ene</span><span>  mies  of  progress,  organised  and  directed</span><span>  by  the  true  champions  of  the  people's</span><span>  Tights,  McBuipble  hijnself  is  displaying</span><span>  more  than  wonted  insolence,  and  is  out</span><span>  .%vith  the  jawbone  of  an  ass  to  slaughter</span><span>  'the  Philistines  who  dare  to  opppso  him.</span><span>  if</span><span>  And,  naturally  enough,  the  only  oppo</span><span>  sition,  so  -'ar  as  the  city  itself  is  con</span><span>  cerned,  is  directed  against  men  who</span><span>  '  stand  for  the  municipal  progress  of  the</span><span>  community,  and  against  whom,  therefore,</span><span>  the  reactionary  forces  hear  an  inveter</span><span>  ate  and  insatiable  grudge.  There  is  the</span><span>  (Merthyr  Ward,  as  a  striking  example  of</span><span>  this  chronic  conspiracy  against:  the  best</span><span>  interest  c  of  \)\t  people.  The  retiring</span><span>  alderman  of  that  ward  is  that  sturdy</span><span>  and  open-handed  democrat,  Wilson,</span><span>  whose  doing3  since  he  has  been  in  the</span><span>  jCity  Council  have  been  signally.  char</span><span>  acterised  by  honesty  and  integrity.  It</span><span>  was  he  who  «uwlcd  over  the  iniquities.  of</span><span>  that  tea  money  business.  That  was</span><span>  ..vrhen  he  had  heen  in  the  Council  for  only</span><span>  a  few  months.  Of  course,  he  had  to</span><span>  fight  the  whole  array  of  Barnacle</span><span>  jMeJJumblc,  but  he  faced  and  fought,  and</span><span>  t  drubbed  them  all.  Also,  he  aefc  to  work</span><span>  to  convert  the  Valley,  and  more  especi</span><span>  ally  .the  ivierthyr  portion  of  it,  from  ft</span><span>  -roiasmiflc  swamp  into  a  healthful,  liabi-</span><span>  table  area.  He  succeeded  in  his  task.</span><span>  ;  lAiid  so'  the  list  might  be  lengthened  to</span><span>  'cover  all  the  work  done  by  him.  Why</span><span>  .  as  it  that  McBumblq  is  after  his  muniei-</span><span>  pa!  ?ea)p?

Vic</span><span>  But  white  me  existing  miserable  sys-</span><span>  -  tcm,  with  its  rott  i  franchise,  continues,</span><span>  the  municipal  affairs  of  this  city—  and,</span><span>  .'indeed,  of  every,  local  governing  area</span><span>  throughout  Queensland  —  must  remain  in</span><span>  ..the  doldrums.  In'  great  progressive</span><span>  'cities,  such  as  those'  in  Continental  coun-</span><span>  '.'trics,  where  county  councils  are  regar</span><span>  ded  as  being  of  more  civic  Importance</span><span>  -than  Parliaments,  t)ie  very  finest  intel</span><span>  lects  in  the  land  are  attracted  to  the</span><span>  work  of  iooal  government.  Some  of  the</span><span>  .  leading  statesmen  in  Great  Britain  to-</span><span>  .'day  graduated  through  county  councils.</span><span>  1  JXhls  is  the  basis  of  reform  at  which  the</span><span>  Legislature  of  tiffs  country  must  aim  be-</span><span>  '  lore  any  efficacious  reform  in  our  local</span><span>  'governing  system  can  bp  possible.  As</span><span>  ""'matters  now  are,  the  Barnacle  &cBumble</span><span>  ""mob,  armed  with  tlm  weapon  Qf.mtric-</span><span>  'ted  franchise,  are  able  to  carry  nearly</span><span>  nil'  before  thcpi.  In'  the  amending  Act</span></p> <p><span>  piuqeff  during  last  session  of  parliament,</span><span>  some  pretence  ut  widening  the  franchise</span><span>  was  made.  It  was  only  o  pretence,  how</span><span>  ever,  for  the  sr.cred  rights  of  ""propputly""</span><span>  were  well  nnd  valiantly  represented  in</span><span>  both  branches  of  the  Legislature,  and</span><span>  more  particularly  by  the  baud  of  politi</span><span>  cal  helots  who  squat,  in  bloat  servility,</span><span>  behind  Kidston  and  his  team  of  political</span><span>  Marionette;.</span><span>  It  is  'most  remarkable,  however,  that</span><span>  a  large  number  of  men  engaged  in  local</span><span>  governing  work  still  cling  to  the  hoary</span><span>  fetich  which  excludes  universal  fran</span><span>  chise  in  connection  with  municipal  elec</span><span>  tions.  Their  wooden-headed  argument  is</span><span>  iiiat  only  ratepayers  should  have  the</span><span>  franchise,  because  that  is  consistent  with</span><span>  the  democratic  principle  of  no  represen</span><span>  tation  without  '  taxation.  The  fact  is</span><span>  that  it  Is  diametrically  opposed,  and  de</span><span>  liberately  destructive  of  that  sound  and</span><span>  heajthful  principle.  Does  not  every  land?</span><span>  lord  compute  Lhe  rent,  ,  which  he  de</span><span>  mands  for.  a  house,  on  the  basis  of  in-</span><span>  eludkig  rfttes?  Imirciorc,  though  jioyii</span><span>  nallv  he  pays  rates,  by  trotting  off  to</span><span>  the  'municipal  Alices  with  the  money,  has</span><span>  he  not  already  dragged  that  money  from</span><span>  hi3  tenant?  Who,  then,  but  the  tenant,</span><span>  actually  pays  rates?  .Take,  also,  the</span><span>  case  of  a  lodger.  U  not  a  due  percen-</span></p> <p><span>  tage  of  rate  mouey  included  m  tne</span><span>  charge  levjed  on  him  for  board  and  lodg</span><span>  ing  by  (he  proprietor  '  of  the  hashery.</span><span>  In  this  regard,  indeed,  the  lodger  is.  the</span><span>  consumer,  and,  always  and  ever,  the  con</span><span>  sumer  is  the  beast  of  burden  for  rates</span><span>  and  taxes.  For  just  as  the  landlord</span><span>  passes  on  the  rate  to  the  hashery-keeper,</span><span>  who  is  the  consumer  of  the  whole  of  'the</span><span>  Jiouso  room,  so  that  hashery-keeper  re</span><span>  passes  it  on  to  the  lodger,  who  is  the</span><span>  consumer  of  only  one  square  of  the  house</span><span>  room.  The  lodger  has  not  any  victim</span><span>  to  whom  to  pass  ou  the  levy,  so  he  Is</span><span>  stuck  ""with  it.  Why  then  should  he</span><span>  not  'have  the  municipal  franchise?</span><span>  Surely,  these  wooden-headed  municipal</span><span>  mugwumps  can  follow  that  logical</span><span>  .reasoning-..</span><span>  N  _</span><span>  However,  It'  if>  ah  tdimtly  dear  that</span><span>  until  the-  municipal  franchise  is  broad</span><span>  ened  on  the  absolutely  democratic  basis</span><span>  of  qdult  suffrage,-  municipal  mugwum-</span><span>  pery  will  oontiii..c  to  hold  sway  iu  local</span><span>  governing  matters,  and  Barn&cle</span><span>  McBunible  will  continue  to  lord  it  over</span><span>  the  smells  and  dust  of  the  neglected</span><span>  city.  Ratepayers  who  have  a  grain  of</span><span>  horse  sense,  therefore,  will  look  to  it</span><span>  that  those  men  whose  services  have  been</span><span>  yeoman  in  the  direction  of  democratis</span><span>  ing  wiunicippi  govornment—  ;men  of  the</span><span>  \Vtison  stamp—  are  not  pushed  aside  for</span><span>  f  resli  mugwumps  who  belong  to  the</span><span>  brood  -  McBupible.
