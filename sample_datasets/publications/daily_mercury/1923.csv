"<p><span>  THE  PAEY  MERCURY.</span></p> <p><span>  MONDAY,  -DECEMIBER  24.  1923.  -</span><span>  CHRISTMA  STIDE  .</span></p> <p><span>  One  of  the  most  pleasant  fealarcs</span><span>  cf  Christmastide  is  -that  it  offers  a</span><span>  brief  respite  from  the  toil:  common</span><span>  to  humanity  -  and  -'-creates  An  atmos</span><span>  phere  totally  different  to  any  other</span></p> <p><span>  season  of  the  year.  A  special  season</span><span>  'Of  rejoicing  from  time  Immemorial</span><span>  seems  to  have  '  prevailed  among  the</span><span>  peoples,  of  the  earth,  a  period  of</span><span>  feasting  and  pleasure  to  celebrate  a</span><span>  national  event  -  or""  national  customs,</span><span>  'With  Europeans  the  festival  is  as</span><span>  sociated  With'  the  'Christian.  Church,</span><span>  observed  4n  honor  of  -the  birth  of</span><span>  Jesus  Christ  Whose  message  was</span><span>  that  peace  and  goodwill  should  reign</span><span>  amongst1  men.  The  Christian-  festi</span><span>  val,  however,'  was  not  original,  but</span><span>  merely  a  diversion,  to  turn  the</span><span>  minds  of  the  early  Christians  ,  from</span><span>  the  heathen  ""festivals  prevalent  at  the</span><span>  time  that  .were  degrading  In  many</span><span>  details.  The  Saturnalia,  -the  festi</span><span>  val  of  ""  Saturn;  was  a  great  national</span><span>  event  with  the  Romans.  It  was</span><span>  celebrated  in  tbe  third  week  in  De</span><span>  cember,  and  lasted  from  five  to</span><span>  'seven  -'days,4  during  which  the,  schools</span><span>  were  closed,  no  war  was  declared  or</span><span>  battle  -fought,  distinctions  of  rank</span><span>  .were-  set  aside,  and  tbe  utmost  free</span><span>  dom  of  speech  was  allowed.  Gamb</span><span>  ling,  otherwise  illegal,  was  allowed.</span><span>  .All  classes  exchanged  gifts,  candles</span><span>  wire  burnt  and  -fires  kindled—  Eng</span><span>  lishmen  still  have  the  Yule  Log  .  or</span><span>  Christmas  Block  —  and  1  the  people</span><span>  give  themselves  up  to  general  joy</span><span>  and  mirth.  With  the  subs/ituiion  of</span><span>  Christianity  for  heathenism  the  '  ne</span><span>  cessity  of  destroying  'the1.  worst  feat</span><span>  ures  of  this  festival  became  obvious,</span><span>  and  tbe  date  of  the  Nativity  was</span><span>  chosen  by  the  Christians'  -for  doing</span><span>  so.  There  is  no  certainty  about  the</span><span>  26th  of  December  being  the  precise</span><span>  date  of  Christ's  birth.  Authorities</span><span>  mostly  ,  agree  that  it  could  not  have</span><span>  taken  place  at  that  time  of  the  year,</span><span>  and  (this  '  .  strengthens  the  opinion</span><span>  that  the  Christian  festival  was  in</span><span>  tended  to  supplant'  the  Saturnalia</span><span>  already  mentioned,  '  which  was-  held</span><span>  In  December.  .  There  need  be  no</span><span>  time  wasted  on  -this  point,  however,</span><span>  for,  as  one  writer  states,  communi</span><span>  ties  whi'ch  observe  the  day  lay  more</span><span>  stress.  on  the  memory  of  the  event  it</span><span>  represents  than  on  the  date  fixed  for</span><span>  the  celebration  .  Christmas  is  .  in</span><span>  dubitably  associated  with  .festivities</span><span>  common  to  birthday  celebrations  .  It</span><span>  is  a  period  of  rejoicing,  more  or  leas</span><span>  unrestrained,  -according  to  the  tem</span><span>  perament  of  '  the,  individual  or  'com</span><span>  munity.  The  ancient  Saturnalia  dif</span><span>  fers  -from  YuletiiJe  only  in  that  it</span><span>  was  disfigured  by  tbe  vice'  that;  was</span><span>  associated  with  heathen  celebrations.</span><span>  Tho  proceedings  of  the  festival  cS</span><span>  Satum  .read  like  the  present-day</span><span>  jChristjnas  'festival,,  /We;'  read;  /that</span></p> <p><span>  ""The  /schools  were  closed.  All</span><span>  classes  exchanged  gifts,  the  common</span><span>  est  being  wax  tapers  and  clay  dolls;</span><span>  these  dolls  were  -  given  to  children,</span><span>  and  the  makers  of  them  held  a  .  re</span><span>  gular  fair  at  the  time,""  That  sounds</span><span>  like  Christmas  shopping  of  the  pre</span><span>  sent  day,  does  it  -not?  Yet  it  was</span><span>  practiced  yearg  before  the  Nativity,</span><span>  the  event  Christians  now  celebrate</span><span>  annually,  and  shows  there  always  has</span><span>  been  good  in  mankind,  that  men  -felt</span><span>  it  desirable  to  have  a  season  of</span><span>  goodwill,  of  rest  from  the  cares  and</span><span>  struggles  of  daily  life  ""when  wars</span><span>  should  not  be  declared  or  battles</span><span>  fought,""  and,  if  more  prominence  is</span><span>  given  to  this  ancient  spirit'  to-day,</span><span>  if  the.spirit  of  tolerance  and  a  wider</span><span>  view  of  life  is  taken  -than,  in  'the</span><span>  ""dark  ages/  who  will  doubt  but  that  it</span><span>  marks  the  gradual  fulfilment  of  the</span><span>  prophetic  angelic  songburst  heard  by</span><span>  .shepherds,  '.'Glory  to  God  :  In  the</span><span>  hjghest,  and  on  earth  peace,  good</span><span>  will  toward,  men,""  Wie  join  in  the</span><span>  salutation  .that  is  offered  everywhere</span><span>  at  th@  present  tiriie;  and  wish  our</span><span>  readers,  .  .</span><span>  ..laLI  /A  .  iMeriy.

"<p><span>  The  Dcrily  Mercury</span></p> <p><span>  SATURDAY,  AIARCH  17,  1923.</span></p> <p><span>  the  cattle  market;</span></p> <p><span>  Any  slump  in  trade  that  affects</span><span>  our  primary  products  first  hits  the</span><span>  producer,  and-'-after  that  the  commun</span><span>  ity  at  large..  Some  times  it  is  re-</span></p> <p><span>  ported  that  the  cattle  men  are  hit,  or</span><span>  the-  sheep  men,  the  wheat  grower,</span><span>  dairymen,  oit  sugar,  grower.  (These</span><span>  primary  producers  at  .varying  times</span><span>  -r-lueklly  it  seldom  happens,  that  they</span><span>  all  suffer  at  the  same  time  —  are  badly</span><span>  affected  by  weather  conditions,  the</span><span>  markets,  or  'something  else.  No  class</span><span>  of  producer  suffers  alone  at  any  time,</span><span>  for  when  their  business  is  depressed</span><span>  scores  of  other  people,  workers,  -busi</span><span>  ness  men  -and  shippers,  suffer  also.</span><span>  The.  community,  therefore,  is  direct</span><span>  ly  .concerned-  in  tho  welfare  of  every</span><span>  primary  produict-'""in  .  tho  same  sense</span><span>  almost  as  a  shareholder  is  in  a  com</span><span>  pany,  or  at  least  members  are  in  any</span><span>  co-operative  concern.  At  ""the</span><span>  present  time  cattle  producers  are</span><span>  suffering  from  ia  very  ser  luus  de</span><span>  pression  j'n  tile  demand  for  stock.</span><span>  These  conditions  are  somewhat  un</span><span>  usual  and  therefore  could  not  be</span><span>  foreseen.  Weather  Conditions  have</span><span>  on  the  whole  been  favorable  for  a</span><span>  long-  time,1  and  nothing  lias  interven</span><span>  ed  to  put  a  check  on  icattle-  raising</span><span>  on  this  side  ""  of-,  the  world.  Tho</span><span>  trouble  is  due  chiefly  -to  the  export</span><span>  trade.  For  years  past  Queensland</span><span>  lias  depended  upon  its  (export  trade</span><span>  for  the  disposal  of  its  surplus  supply.</span><span>  There  was  always  the  London  market</span><span>  to  fall  back  upon  and  prior  to  the</span><span>  war  at  least  the  meat  companies  felt</span><span>  that  that  -market  could  be  used  profit</span><span>  ably  to  relieve  any  congestion  o£</span><span>  supplies  at  this  -end.  This  outlet  is</span><span>  no  longer  open  to  Australia,  as  iu</span><span>  pre-war  days.  'South  America  is  now</span><span>  a  formidable  opponent  of  Australia</span><span>  inasmuch  as  it-  can.  -supply  /most  of  tho</span><span>  foreign  jmeat  required  -by  .England,</span><span>  and  is  able  to  send  it  across  in  a</span><span>  chilled  state  in  four  -weeks,  whereas</span><span>  Australia  requires  four  months  to</span><span>  land  its  beef  in  London,  and  it  has</span><span>  to  be  frozen.  The  -market  prefers</span><span>  chilled  meat.'  It  is  also  stated  that</span><span>  South  American  beef  is  marketed  in</span><span>  a  more  excellent  condition  than  the</span><span>  Australian.  Another  disadvantage</span><span>  that  Australia  suffers;  from  is  that</span><span>  frozen  meat  is  sent  oyer  in  the  second</span><span>  half  of  tlie  year,  when  home  grown</span><span>  beef  is  plentiful.  The  -bulk  of  the</span><span>  Australian'  shipments  arrive  in  Eng</span><span>  land  between  July  and  December.</span><span>  Another  drawback  in-,tjie  competition</span><span>  -between  South  America  and  Austra?</span><span>  lia  is  the  difference  in  the  cost  of</span><span>  production.  South  American  rates</span><span>  are  much  lower,  than  the  Australian</span><span>  standard,  ;and  '.'the  combination  of</span><span>  cheaper  rates  in  tlie  pastures,  in  the</span><span>  killing  yards,  and  in.  the  shipment  of</span><span>  beef  to  London  tells  heavily  against</span><span>  Australia.  As  (showing  tlie  effect</span><span>  of  -  present  conditions;'  upon  .  the  Rattle</span><span>  industry  we  '  might  qucSte  from  the</span><span>  last  ""annual  report  of  the  Queensland</span><span>  Xatioual  Pastoral  Company,  which</span><span>  states:  ""During  tlie  year  we  sold</span><span>  9222  head'  of  cattle,  -practically  all</span><span>  fat  bullocks,  for  £40,533,  an  average</span><span>  cf  £4/7,  -110  per  head,  against  10.35S</span><span>  -head  for  £109;53G  for  the  preceding</span><span>  year,  an  average  of  £10/11/7,  and  for</span><span>  1920  we  sold  99911  at  an  average  of</span><span>  £13/3/9  per  head.  These  figures</span><span>  speak  for  themselves,  and  it  is</span><span>  easily  understandable  that  no  profit</span><span>  can  be  made  out  ofxattle  under  pre</span><span>  sent-day  conditions,  anil  until  there</span><span>  is  a  decided  general  improvement  in</span><span>  stock  values.  On  the  other  hand,</span><span>  wool  selling  conditions  were  as  good</span><span>  as  one  could  wish  -  and  compensated</span><span>  in  a  measure  for  the  low  meat  prices</span><span>  and  droughty  conditions  under  which</span><span>  -w-e  have  had  to  labor:  Since  1920</span></p> <p><span>  our  cattle  sales  have  dropped</span><span>  £S/1E/11  per  head,  and  £91,241  in</span><span>  volume.""  As  there  is  no  prospect</span><span>  of  ail  improvement  taking  place  with</span><span>  out  special  assistance,  it  is  claimed</span><span>  that,  Britain  should  give  preference</span><span>  to  British  grown  foodstuffs  a-s  against</span><span>  the  produce  of  such  cheap  foreign</span><span>  countries  as  South  America.  In  Eng</span><span>  land,  however,  there  is  the  same  ele</span><span>  ment  that  we  have  in  Victoria,</span><span>  which  talks  loudly  in  support  of</span><span>  Empire  trade  but  when  it  comes  to</span><span>  fostering  that  trade'  in;  the  only  pos</span><span>  sible  way  they  use  all  their  influence</span><span>  tp  prevent  the  Government  from  doing</span><span>  if!  English  freetraders  want  cheap</span><span>  foodstuffs  just  the  same  as  Victorians</span><span>  want  cheap  sugar,  -and  despite  their</span><span>  patriotic  protestations  they  do  not</span><span>  care  whether  it  is  produced  by  black</span><span>  or  foreign  labor,  (as  long  (as  tfliey</span><span>  get  it.  Unless  Great  Britain  does</span><span>  something  practical  in  the  .  direction</span><span>  of  encouraging  supplies  of  foodstuffs</span><span>  from  within  the  Empire  sources  of</span><span>  production  must  be  curtailed,  as  is</span><span>  now  threatening  in  the  case  of  the</span><span>  cattle  industry.  ....</span></p> ",Article,1923-03-17,"The Daily Mercury SATURDAY, MARCH 17, 1923.

A  good  fo>v</span><span>  birds  were  collected  but  of  the  few</span><span>  species  of  large  mammals  known  to</span><span>  exist  in  thut  aroa  we  saw  but'  throe  or</span><span>  four  individuals,  and  these  were  so</span><span>  elusive  that  we  seldom  had  more  than</span><span>  a  glimpse  of  them  as  they  dashed  away</span><span>  through  the  bush.  Nntives  who  had</span><span>  lived  there  all  their  lives  told  us  that</span><span>  they  seldom  suw  an  animal,  and  did</span><span>  not  depend  on  them  at  all  for  food.</span><span>  Sometimes  the  natives  are  short  of  food,</span><span>  but  this,  need  never  happen  if  they</span><span>  cared  to  cultivate  potatoeV  or,  plant</span><span>  coconnuts  oh  the  many  suitable  benches</span><span>  along  the  coast.</span><span>  A  Trip  Overland.</span><span>  The  absence  of  animals  in  the  Cape</span><span>  Grenville  district  made  it  necessary  for</span><span>  me  to  travel  inland  and  south  to  dis</span><span>  cover,  if  possible,  just  where  the  game-</span><span>  inhabited  country  was  to  be  found.  So.</span><span>  when  the  launch  arrived  to  convey  us</span><span>  back  to  Thursday  Island,  the  rest  of</span><span>  the  expedition  went  on  board,  and  I</span><span>  set  out  for  Moreton  telegraph  station,</span><span>  on  the,  western  side  of  the  Great  Di-</span><span>  1  viding  Range.  It  was  necessary  to  walk</span><span>  :  and  carry  's  pack  for  the  first  stage  of</span><span>  the  journey,  and  the  load  was  to  be</span><span>  reduced  to  a  mimimum.  Johnnie,  a</span><span>  native,  was  to  go  with  me  as  guide.</span><span>  In  the  hurry  to  get  the  party  away</span><span>  on  the  launch,  everything  was  bundled</span><span>  on  board,  and  the  serviceable  eating</span><span>  and  cooking  utensils  went  with  them,</span><span>  and  when  I  came  to  pack  my  gear  I</span><span>  found  that  I  should  have  to  make-shift</span><span>  with  one  or  two  old  cans  and  a  sheath-</span><span>  kni£e-  i!</span><span>  This,  of-  course,  was  no  unsurmount-</span><span>  able  difficulty,  but  for  a  white  man  lo</span><span>  be  without  knife,  fork,  plate,  and  spoon</span><span>  at  meals  in  front  of  a  native,  is  to</span><span>  lose  all:  dignity  from  the  native's  point</span><span>  of  view,  and  he  is  treated  thereafter</span><span>  with  studied  contempt  or  'ignored.</span><span>  These  conditions  pleased  me  rather  than</span><span>  .otherwise,  for  the  dignity  that  needs</span><span>  to  be  upheld  by  .the  dexterous  use  of</span><span>  table  utensils  may  well  be  foregone  for</span><span>  the  opportunity  to  study  the  natives'</span><span>  natural  'behaviour  and  not  his  acquired</span><span>  company  manners  that  are  adopted  from</span><span>  the  white'  men.  Johnnie  was  no  excep</span><span>  tion  to  the  rule,  and  showed  plainly  his</span><span>  opinion  of  me  after  our  first  meal  to</span><span>  gether.  :</span><span>  Stuck  in  the  Mud.</span><span>  O.ur  camp  had  been  on  the  south</span><span>  side  of  the  Olive  River,  and  from  there</span><span>  we  struck  out  in  a  west-by-northerly</span><span>  course  across  the  sandy  tree-covered</span><span>  River  that  runs  right  up  to  the  foot,</span><span>  of  the  Dividing  Range.  Beyond  the</span><span>  hills  towards  a  branch  of  the  Olive  :</span><span>  hills  near  the  coast  is  a  stretch  of</span><span>  flat,  swlunpy.  ground,  overgrown  with</span><span>  low  trees  and  pandanus  palms.  We</span><span>  skirted  'most'  of  the  wetter  .patches,</span><span>  but  there  was  one,  several  '  miles  long,</span><span>  but  not  '  very  wide,  that  Johnnie  ele.c-  .</span><span>  ted  to  cross.  This  was  the  only  bad</span><span>  patch  on  the  route,  so  he  said,  and</span><span>  here  the  mud  was  ""too  much,  plenty</span><span>  soft,  but  suppose  takem  off  -boot's,  you</span><span>  cross  all  right.""</span><span>  With  a  pack  of  some  GO  pounds,  and</span><span>  my  own  heavy  weight,  I  sank  deeper</span><span>  and  deeper  at  each  step,  in  ground</span><span>  that  joiin.nie  walked  over  with  com</span><span>  parative  ease.  The  .  more  I  hurried</span><span>  the  deeper  I  wont,  and  we  presently</span><span>  came  to  a  spot  that  seemed  bottom</span><span>  less.  v  '  '</span><span>  Unable  to.  extract  my  feet,  I  was</span><span>  slowly  sinking;  ""and  throwing  my  pack</span><span>  ahead,  and  leaning  as  far  forward  as</span><span>  'possible,  waited  in  that  position  until</span><span>  'Johnnie  could  pave  the  way  with  bro</span><span>  ken  bushes,  over  which  I  crawled  to  the</span><span>  harder  ground  beyond.'</span><span>  We  .were  a  sorry  spectacle  before</span><span>  we  reached  the  well-grassed  ground  on</span><span>  the  other  side  of  the  swamp.</span><span>  A  Blaekts  Camp.</span><span>  After  a  two  hours'  yyplk  \ye  came  t.o.</span><span>  the  Olive  River,  a,nd  enjoyed  a  bath</span><span>  and  a  swim,  and,  crossing  the  stream,</span><span>  we  followed  its  northern  bank  until</span><span>  'reaching  a  native  camping  place.  There</span><span>  were  four  families  of  natives  here,  and</span><span>  they  were  all  suffering  from  the  same</span><span>  type  of-  cold  that  Johnnie  had,  and</span><span>  which,  they  said,  they  bad  contyactifd'</span><span>  from  other  pp.  ti.ves  further  inland.</span><span>  They  had  beep  ;too  iib  Ld  hunt  for  'food</span><span>  during  the  last  two  or  three  days,  so</span><span>  they  said,  but  this  was  probably  a  story</span><span>  told  to  affect  my  expected  generosity.

The  surface  is</span><span>  snndy  .,unti)  the  Main  Range  is  reached,</span><span>  and  then  we  found  coarse  sandstone</span><span>  and  ironstone  boulders,  with  a  little  red</span><span>  soil  here  and  there.  The  timber  was</span><span>  mostly  ti-tree  and  bloodwood,  but  a  few</span><span>  ""gums""  were  seen  neartlie  bank  of</span><span>  the  river.  .</span><span>  During  the  greater  part  of  the  jour</span><span>  ney  we  were  in  open  country,  where</span><span>  the  grnss  hnd  been""  a  few  days  before</span><span>  three  or  four  fc'et  high,'  but  whieli  had</span><span>  now  disappeared  in  the  huge  fires  that</span><span>  had  swept  the  country  for  miles.  An</span><span>  occasional  patch  of  grass  had  escaped,</span><span>  but  Johnnie  never  failed!  to  drop  a</span><span>  match  into  this  as  we  passed,  arid  a</span><span>  trail  of  smoke'  and  roaring  flames  went</span><span>  off  to  leeward.  In  these  districts,  and</span><span>  about  the  time  of  the  year,  the  grass</span><span>  is  burnt  off,  annually,  and  in  a  few</span><span>  weeks,  o.ven  without  any  rain,  the  shoots</span><span>  nppear,  and  soon  the  blackened  ground</span><span>  is  covered  with  a  waving  mass  of</span><span>  green.  '</span><span>  We  ascended  the  range  by  the  river</span><span>  valley,  and  on  either,  side  were!  sand</span><span>  stone  ridges.  Johnnie  pointed  south  to</span><span>  a  'round-topped  peuk,  and'  said,  '.'Plenty</span><span>  lie  too  much  gold  stop  there:""  He  de</span><span>  clared  that  no  white  man.  -.had  seen  it,'</span><span>  but  I  am  led  to  believe  that  this  is  a</span><span>  stock  story  with  the  natives;</span><span>  Absence  of  Life.</span><span>  So  far  we  bad  seen  no  ,  animals,  and</span><span>  birds  were  just  as  scarce  as  they  were</span><span>  near  he  coast.  One  conspicuous  addi</span><span>  tion  to  their  number  was  the  southern</span><span>  jackass,  whose  raucous  laugh;ter  we  had</span><span>  not  heard  for  several  weeks,  its  place</span><span>  being  taken  by  the  curious  squawkings</span><span>  of  the  brightof-plumaged  northern  bird.</span><span>  It  was  not  until  passing  inland  for  oyer</span><span>  20  miles  that  I  heard'  the  familiar  laugh</span><span>  ing  sound,  and  it  was  comparatively</span><span>  rare  in  all  districts  visited  in  York</span><span>  Peninsula.</span><span>  We  camped  at  the  foot  of  a  steep</span><span>  hill  that  topped  the  range,  and  next</span><span>  morning  began  ;the  ascent.  Although</span><span>  our  altitude  was  never,  high,  it  seemed</span><span>  that-  we  climbed  ,  to  the  highest  part  of</span><span>  the.  r.idgc,  avoiding,  the  lower  passes.</span><span>  The  reason  for  this  was  .clear  when  ive</span><span>  Reached  the  .summit  and  coulil  sen</span><span>  through  the  tree  tops  that  we  had</span><span>  skirted  many  patches  of  thick  scrub,</span><span>  and  ,by  fpHojving;  ,fhe  ,  top  ..'of  the  ridge</span><span>  we  would  be  able  '  to  keep  in  '  well-</span><span>  grassed  country  most  of-  the  way.</span><span>  Slowly  descending,,  we  came  to  a  bet</span><span>  ter  class  of  soil,  and  soon  found  traces</span><span>  of  animal  life;  First  a  few  tracks  of</span><span>  kangaroos  were  ""seen,  and  .then  those  of  '</span><span>  wallabies,  and  towards  the  foot  :  of  the  j</span><span>  range  we  found  traces  of.  horses  and  I</span><span>  cattle.

It  would  have</span><span>  been  useless  to  throw  the  tea  away;</span><span>  since  the  next  boiling  would  have  been</span><span>  served  in  a  simi.lar  manner,  so  we  sipped,</span><span>  our  soupy  beverage  as  stoically  as  pos</span><span>  sible.:  I  have  'eaten  frogs'  legs  in</span><span>  France,  and  found  them  tasty,  but  the</span><span>  thought  of  drinking  frog  was  certainly</span><span>  nob  pleasant,  and  we  went  to  bed  rather</span><span>  thirsty  that  night.  Even  under  our</span><span>  blankets  we  were  not  free  fr.u  the</span><span>  pests,  ,  and  several  times  I  was  awakened</span><span>  by  a  slimy  body  alighting  heavily  on</span><span>  my  face.

Native  Diffidence,</span><span>  From  Lydia  Creek  we  went  to</span><span>  (several)  (other  water  cours'es,  but  in</span><span>  no  place  were  mammals  plentiful.  A</span><span>  few  tracks  could  be  seen,  and  an  oc</span><span>  casional  marsupial,  but  they  were  all</span><span>  exceptionally  timid.  It  was  not  until</span><span>  we  reached  the  home  paddocks  of  tlie</span><span>  station  .that  we  found  the  animals  and</span><span>  birds-  more  plentiful.

This  they  failed  to  do,  and  the</span><span>  fact  that  I  had  not  been  able  to  get</span><span>  a  single  specimen  from  the  natives</span><span>  puzzled  me,  until  oho  day,  towards  the</span><span>  end  of  my  trip,  my  guide  confessed</span><span>  that  the  ""bush""  natives  would  not  hunt</span><span>  for.  ,  me;  because,  although  I  had  offered</span><span>  them  any  amount  of  money  and  to</span><span>  bacco,  they  hid  heard  that  I  .wanted</span><span>  tiio  skins  and(.  skeletons  of  everything,</span><span>  and  '  when  '  I  had  'secured  all  the  walla</span><span>  bies  and  opossums  I  wanted,  I  would</span><span>  take  the  skin  'and  ,  bones  of  several</span><span>  natives.

Paint-</span><span>  .has  covered  most  of  the  rust,  but  in  the</span><span>  walls  of  '  the  room  I  occupied,  many</span><span>  h(oles  are  visible.  .  These  nail  holes</span><span>  were  the  means  of  giving  me  a  shock</span><span>  in  the  early  hours  of  the  morning,  and</span><span>  .had  it  not  been  for  the  fact  that  I  am</span><span>  an  abstainer,  I  might  have  attributed</span><span>  the  phenomenon  I  saw  to  other  sources.</span><span>  I  wakened  just  -after  duylight,  and.</span><span>  before  mo  on  the  wall  I  saw  ton</span><span>  shjadowy  witches  leaping  wildly,  and</span><span>  brandishing  a  broom,  while  an  elon</span><span>  gated  mammal  streaked  in  front.  My</span><span>  sleep-lulled  brain  wns  stnrtled  until  I</span><span>  heard  the  shouts,  and  realised  that  tbo</span><span>  nail-Koles  in  the  wall  had  converted  the</span><span>  room  into  a  camera  abscura,  and  by</span><span>  the  pin-hole  photographic  method  I  was</span><span>  seeing  ah  animated  shadowgraph,  mul</span><span>  tiplied  by  the  number  of  holes,  of  an</span><span>  old  nntive  woman  chasing  a  dog  that</span><span>  -had  stolen  the  breakfast  steak  from</span><span>  the  kitchen  table.</span><span>  Days  on  the  Coast.</span><span>  At  Coen  I  was  faced  with  the  long</span><span>  and  somewhat  uninteresting  ride  to</span><span>  Laura,  and  then  to  Cooktown  by  train,</span><span>  but  by.  good  fortune  I  heard  that  it</span><span>  might  be  possible  to  catch  a  boat  pass</span><span>  ing  (Flinders  Island,  and  decided  to</span><span>  ride  to  Port  Stewart,  and  by  arrange</span><span>  ment  with  the  owner  of  a  fleet  '  of</span><span>  beche-d'e-nier  ""fishing""  boats,  get  put</span><span>  on  board.  I  hurried  towards  the  coast,</span><span>  crossing  the  Great  Dividing  Range</span><span>  again  wiith  its  granite  outcrops  and</span><span>  round-topped  hills,  and  then,  across  the</span><span>  broad  flat  plain  to  Port  Stewart.  At</span><span>  Port.

We  camped  ashore-</span><span>  one  night,  and.  received  an  official.  visit</span><span>  from  King  Fred  (aborigine),  of  Lloyd's</span><span>  Bay,  and  several  neighboring  districts.</span><span>  King  Fred  was  dressed  in  khaki  shirt,</span><span>  trousers,  and  -wore  on  liis  head  a  towel</span><span>  rolled  .  and  twisted  to  form  a  crown.</span><span>  Suspended  from  a  chain  slung  round</span><span>  his  neck  was  a  crescent-shaped  brass-</span><span>  plate  proclaiming  the  area  of  his  do-</span><span>  'minions  and  his  native  name  and  tot'em.</span><span>  Ke  introduced  me  .  to  his  followers,  and</span><span>  suggested  that  I  reward  them'  with-  -to</span><span>  bacco.

Wiiisb  with  his  opinion  on  tho</span><span>  rival  merits  of  the  various  proposed</span></p> <p><span>  silos  for  tlie  bridge  over  the  Pioneer.</span><span>  Captain''  'Wliish,  we  :  arc  glad  to  say,</span><span>  takes  jnto  .consideration  not  .  only  'Hip</span><span>  natural  advantages  for  building  the</span><span>  bridge,  but  .the  requirements  of  the</span><span>  population  with  regard  to  facility  of</span><span>  approach  and  contralily  of  position.</span><span>  Taking  first  the  Sydney-street  site,  ha</span><span>  considers  it  would  require  a  longer</span><span>  bridge  than  .  elsewhere,  and  also  an</span><span>  extra  expense  would  have  to  be  in</span><span>  curred  in.  making  a  drawbridge  such</span><span>  as  would  allow  vessels  to  pass</span><span>  through;  the  read  on  the  opposite</span><span>  bank  would  have  to  be  made  a  con</span><span>  siderable  distance,  and  a  creek  to  be</span><span>  spanned  if  the  line  of  road  were  ex</span><span>  tended  to  the  northward;  as.  however</span><span>  the  greater  number  of  the  settlers  lie</span><span>  to  the  westward,  this  objection  would</span><span>  not  greatly  apply,  but  the  site  on  the</span></p> <p><span>  wliolo,-  he  considers,  is  hardly  suffi</span><span>  ciently  central.  The  next'  site  is</span><span>  across  by'  the'  island,  which  abuts  on</span><span>  very  low  ground  on  the  south  side,</span><span>  and  would  require  two  bridges  of  640</span><span>  and  -330  feet  respectively,  besides  cul</span><span>  verts  and  logging.  The  third  site,</span><span>  that  at  the  Rocks,  would  probably  be</span><span>  a-  very,  expensive  one,  owing  to  the</span><span>  impossibility  of  driving  piles,  in</span><span>  addition  to  which  it  is  just  below  a</span><span>  sharp  bend  of  the  river,  always  'a</span><span>  serious  objection,  as  in  such  cases,</span><span>  debris  is  very  likely  .to  accumulate  in</span><span>  flood  time  and  endanger  tlie  safety  of</span><span>  the  structure;  it  is  also  very  low</span><span>  land  on  tho  back  and  may  before  long</span><span>  bo  entirely  cut  off  from  the  south  side</span><span>  by  the  cutting  through  by  the  river</span><span>  of  a  neck  of  sandy  land  between  it</span><span>  ana  a  mangrove.  creek  that  flows  back</span></p> <p><span>  from  below.  The  JobjectiOa  to  Am-</span><span>  hurst's  Crossing,  are  that  it  is  not</span><span>  central  enough,  and  -/that  a  bridge</span><span>  there  would  be  practically  thrown</span><span>  away,'  as  the  crossing  is  one  of  the</span><span>  best  in  tiie.  river  and  almost  always</span><span>  available.  The  site  then  that  ap</span><span>  pears  to  best:.  meet  the  requirements</span><span>  of  the  district  as'  a  whole  is  that  at</span><span>  tlio  Hospital;  a  road  would  have,</span><span>  however,  to  be  made  through  portion</span><span>  of  Messrs.  Long's  land,  and  a  second</span><span>  bridge  thrown  over  the  creek  there.</span><span>  This.  would,  of  course,  add  to  the  ex</span><span>  pense,  but  Captain  Whisli  considers</span><span>  that  i't  would  be  regarded  as  part  of</span><span>  the  expense  to  be  necessarily  incur</span><span>  red  in  tlie  erection  of  a  bridge  at  this</span><span>  site.  As  otherwise  settlers  to  the</span><span>  north  and  easL  would  have  to  go  so</span><span>  far  round  that  the  same  objection  of</span><span>  its  not  being  sufficiently  cei'.il</span><span>  -would  apply  to  this  site  as  it  does  to-</span><span>  tha.t'at  Amhurst's  Crossing.</span><span>  The  proprietors  advise  that  the</span><span>  ""Daily  Mercury""  may  now  ho  read  in</span><span>  London  at  tlie  news  room  of  Messrs.</span><span>  Gordon  &  Gotch,  121  Holhoin  Hill,</span><span>  where  advifcisements  and  subserip-</span><span>  tions  for  same,  may  be  .received;  ,</span><span>  Advertisers  in-  this  week's  issue,  in</span><span>  clude.—  John  Duffy,  fancy,  bifcad  and</span><span>  biscuit  maker,  Sydney-street;  ,  P  J-</span><span>  Cronin,  anlneral  vvaters  and  cordial</span><span>  manufacturer,  I  Victoria-street  ;  .
