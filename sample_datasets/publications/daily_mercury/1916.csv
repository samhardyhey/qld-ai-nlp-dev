"<p><span>  The  Daily  Mercury-</span></p> <p><span>  !  WEDNESDAY,  JULY  26,  19IG.</span><span>  ""ALL  GOES  WELL  IN  THE  WEST.""</span></p> <p><span>  A  fortnight  ago  General  Sir  Doug</span><span>  las  Haig  reported  ""All  goes  well.""</span><span>  Although  the  Franco-British  advance</span><span>  has  not  been  pushed  since  that  first</span><span>  great  and  grand  rush  and  ground  is</span><span>  sometimes  lost  that  was  won  at  great</span></p> <p><span>  sacrifice,  the  cablegrams  hear  only</span><span>  .me  meaning,  that  the  offensive  is  be</span><span>  ing  prosecuted  with  tho  utmost  vig</span><span>  our,  and  despite  all  checks  all  is</span><span>  going  as  well  as  the  army  leaders</span><span>  could  expect.  The  German  state</span><span>  ment  that  the  British  advance  has</span><span>  been  checked  is  Slot  supported  by</span><span>  Jie  daily  happenings.  A  lull  in  the</span><span>  attack  does  not  imply  that  it  has</span><span>  been  stemmed.  As  one  writer  points</span><span>  out,  villages  cannot  be  taken  every</span><span>  day,  and  a  certain  amount  of  con</span><span>  solidation  has  to  take  place  before</span><span>  further  advances  are  attempted.  Dur</span><span>  ing  these  intervals  the  enemy  is  not</span><span>  asleep.  It  is  the  time  for  counter</span><span>  attack,  and  the  Germans  have  proved</span><span>  .itnes  out  of  numjjer  that  they  do  not</span><span>  value  human  life  when  they  are  de</span><span>  termined  to  win  back  any  lost</span><span>  .  ground.  What  seems  to  be  .'fairly-</span><span>  clear  is  that  the  German  second  line</span><span>  has  been  broken  and  is  in  such  grave</span><span>  peril  that  tho  Allies  may  at  any  time</span><span>  sweep  beyond  it  to  the  encounter  for</span><span>  ;.he  third  line  now  securely  held  by</span><span>  the  Germans.  Late  news  states  that</span><span>  the  Germans  are  hurrying  up  over</span><span>  300,000  troops  to  meet  the  Kaiser's</span><span>  ""contemptible  little  British  army,""</span><span>  and  the  public  may  rest  assured  that</span><span>  the  new  arrivals  will  give  a  good</span><span>  :  account  of  themselves  before  they</span><span>  j  are  overwhelmed  by  the  Allies.  Some</span><span>  speculation  has  been  caused  concern</span><span>  ing  the  size  of  Britain's  ""contempt</span><span>  ible  little  army,""  and  from  sources</span><span>  that  are  usually  recognised  to  be  au-</span><span>  horitative  it  would  appear  that  Brit</span><span>  ain  has  now  as  large  and  perhaps</span><span>  a  larger  army  in  France  than  the</span><span>  French.  Paris  ""Figaro,""  a  very  re</span><span>  liable  journal,  Recently  stated  .that</span><span>  Britain  has  in  two  years  produced</span><span>  .wo  armies  which  will  be  the  largest</span><span>  m  the  western  front  That  is  what</span><span>  the  late  Lord  Kitchener  succeeded</span><span>  j  in  doing  by  his  wonderful  organising</span><span>  abilities,  and  the  Empire  is  about  to</span><span>  eap  the  reward  of  his  labours.  For</span><span>  a  time  the  Empire  was  unable  to</span><span>  urn  out  the  armies  that  were  re</span><span>  quired  to  overcome  German  hordes</span><span>  that  were  trained  to  the  hour,  but</span><span>  eke  period  of  waiting  has  now  been</span><span>  overcome,  and  Britain's  resources  in</span><span>  men  and  material  can  he  pitted  with</span><span>  confidence  against  .'the  hordes  'that</span><span>  were  to  conquer  Europe  and  the</span><span>  world.  The  result  of  ""the  ,  ..Conflict</span><span>  since  Britain  assumed  the  offensive</span><span>  gives  abundant  hope  of  final  victory.</span><span>  The  Germans  were  powerfully  entren</span><span>  ched  in  their  first  line  of  defence.</span><span>  They  prepared  their  defences  in  the</span><span>  full  knowledge  that  a  British  offen</span><span>  sive  was  as  sure  to  come  as  the  sun</span><span>  was  to  rise;  they  knew  that  ""the</span><span>  day""  they  were  preparing  for  was</span><span>  as  certain  as  death,  and  they  made</span><span>  most  ample  preparation.  The  ela</span><span>  borate  defences  the  British  troops</span><span>  had  to  encounter  gives  an  idea  of</span><span>  what  these  defences  are  like,  but  they</span><span>  were  not  strong  enough  to  keep  the</span><span>  British  Tommies  out  when  they  were</span><span>  told  to  advance  to  the  capture.  What</span><span>  the  people  now  have  to  do  more  than</span><span>  anything  else  is  to  possess  their</span><span>  souls  in  patience.  The  Germans  are</span><span>  not  yet  beaten,  nor  have  our  troops</span></p> <p><span>  started  on  the  long-promised  joy</span><span>  visit  to  Berlin.  Tho  Rhine  is  still  a</span><span>  long  way  off,  indeed,  as  some  writers</span><span>  have  been  careful  to  point  out,  the</span><span>  British  advance  only  amounts'  to  a</span><span>  very  few  miles,  and  Brussels  is  still</span><span>  further  away  from  the  fighting  than</span><span>  Paris.  Still,  the  great  point  to  bear</span><span>  in  mind  is  that  the  British  have  joy</span><span>  fully  declared  that  they  encountered</span><span>  the  best  German  troops  and  -  have</span><span>  beaten  them,  and  they  know  that  they</span><span>  can  beat  them  again,  and  this  know</span><span>  ledge  is  equally  well  known  to  the</span><span>  Germans;  and  herein  lies  the  great</span><span>  value  of  the  offensive  as  far  as  it</span><span>  has  gone,  it  has  filled  the  Germans</span><span>  with  respect  for  '  Britain's  ""contempt</span><span>  ible  little  army,""  and  affected  their</span><span>  morale  to  such  an  extent  that  every</span><span>  fresh  advance  will  weaken  tl.em  at</span><span>  fighters  and  make  it  easier  for  the</span><span>  Allies  to  recover  the  ground  taken</span><span>  by  the  invaders  than  it  was  to  cap</span><span>  ture  the  almost  impregnable  first  line.</span><span>  Though  'the  Allies  have  a  long  way</span><span>  to  go,  Sir  Douglas  Haig's  heartening</span><span>  message  that  ""All  goes  well""  will  in-</span><span>  splre  confidence.</span></p> ",Article,1916-07-26,"The Daily Mercury.
