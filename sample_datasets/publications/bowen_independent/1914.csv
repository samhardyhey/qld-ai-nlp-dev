On  the  face</span><span>  '  of  this  it  would  seem  as  if  the  Catholic  min  ~</span><span>  ority  was  trying  to  infiiot  some.  gave</span><span>  ,wrong  on  the  Protestant  majority,  but</span><span>  when  we  examine  the  figures  closely,;  and</span><span>  find  that  Ulster  is  ropresen  ted  in  the  House</span><span>  of  Commons  by  17  Home  Eulers  and  16</span><span>  Unionists,  it  does  not  seem  feasible  that</span><span>  the  Catholic  minority  are  responsible:  for</span><span>  this  representation.  How  I  have  proved  to</span><span>  you'that  the  majority  of  people  in  Ulster  ;</span><span>  Protestants  and  Catholics  combined,  are  in</span><span>  favour  of  Home’Eule,  but  add  to  this  the</span><span>  overwhelming  majority  in  favour  of  Home</span><span>  Eule  in]the  other  Provinces  (your  corres</span><span>  pondent  has  failed  to  give  the  representa</span><span>  tion  of  the  different  Provinces  in  the  House</span><span>  of  Commons)  and  he  will  find  that  only</span><span>  about  one-sixth  of  the  people  of  Ireland</span><span>  ate  not  in  favour  of  Home  Eule,  and  let  ns</span><span>  imagine  any  Bill  in  Australia  having  to</span><span>  get  eloven-twolths  of  the  majority  before</span><span>  it  became  law.  Some  of  his  figures  also</span><span>  seem  to  me  to  be  out  of  gear,  In  Ulster  he</span><span>  gives  the  proportion  of  CathoUosas  42'2‘</span><span>  per  cent  and  the  Protestant  population</span><span>  only  47  per  cent,  to  try  and  make  his  case</span><span>  good,'  but  anyone  knows  that  the  people  of</span><span>  Ireland  are  nut  heathens,  and  any  person</span><span>  therefore  not  in  the  as  Catholics</span><span>  (with  the  Gxcoptiqn  of  a  fow  J  owe)  must  be</span><span>  Protestants,  either  classified  or  unclassified.</span><span>  Than  again  take  his  figures  of  two  (2)  of</span><span>  the  three  (3)  predominant  Catholie  Pro</span><span>  vinces  to  day,  as  compared  with  a</span><span>  decado  ago,  and  we  will  find  that  in  ..each'</span><span>  those  provinces  there  were  10  years  ago</span><span>  over  100  per  cent  of  Catholics  which  as</span><span>  proved  by  hypothesis  is  absurd,'  The  fig</span><span>  ures  arc—Connaught—os  per  cent  Homan</span><span>  Catholics;  decrease  during  last  decade</span><span>  ll'O  per  cent.

In  reply  to</span><span>  the  statement  that  an  equal  number  of</span><span>  Catholics  and  Protestants  roughly  is  go</span><span>  ing  strong  against  Home  Buie,  was  it  not,</span><span>  in  the  Protestant  seat  of  Berry  that  the</span><span>  latest  addition  to  tho  Home  Buie  Party  in</span><span>  the  House  of  Commons.

I  expect  it  is  seldom  you</span><span>  hear  from  Merinda,  so  I  will  give</span><span>  you  a  description  of  this  set</span><span>  tlement.  It  is  situated  on  the</span><span>  Don  water-course  at  the  Alligator</span><span>  Lagoon.  It  is  six  miles  from</span><span>  Bowen,  on  the  Ayr  line.  The</span><span>  works  kill  about  130  head  per  day.</span><span>  The  manager,  O.  J.  Marshall,  is  a</span><span>  good  sort,  and  they  tell  me  he  is  a</span><span>  N.S.  Wales  native.  The  chief  en</span><span>  gineer,  T.  G.  Jackson,  is  not  a  bad</span><span>  sort,'and  I  would-take  him  to  be  a</span><span>  Rockhampton  native.  The  firm,  I</span><span>  think,  is  Houlder  Bros.,  and  I  pro</span><span>  mise  you  that  if  they  are  in  any  way</span><span>  connected  with  the  owners  of  the</span><span>  Grange  line  of  steamers  they  are</span><span>  pretty  tight.  Taking  everything</span><span>  into  consideration,  every  person  on</span><span>  the  settlement,  from  boss,  to  gutty</span><span>  men.  are  very  friendly.</span><span>  .  The  settlement  possesses  two</span><span>  stores,  one  pub,  large  school  build</span><span>  ings,  and  last,  but  not  least,  an  up</span><span>  to-date  police  station.  The  school</span><span>  buildings  are  very  large  and  notice</span><span>  able.  You  must  take  into  consider</span><span>  ation  that  a  few  years  ago  the  slack</span><span>  seasons!  were  very  long  here,  and</span><span>  outdoor  work  very  scarce.</span><span>  Like  every  small  place  Merinda</span><span>  possesses  its  cliques,  and  our  clique</span><span>  is  confined  to  the  Butchers'  Union,</span><span>  or  what  I  would  call  the  Cookies’</span><span>  Trust,  for,  Mr  Editor,  it  is  nothing</span><span>  else,  and  mark  you,  when  Mr  An</span><span>  drew  Fisher  comes  along  he  will</span><span>  i  find  them  not  with  him,  but  Cooked,</span><span>  {They  run  everything  but  the  pub,</span><span>  ,  and  they  don’t  want  that—not  that</span><span>  I  they  are  to  be  blamed  on  that  ac</span><span>  count.

As  1  said  before,  we  have  a.</span><span>  pub  in  the  settlement,  and  Bung  is</span><span>  about  the  most  independent  chap  in</span><span>  |  the  place.  Such  is  due  to  the  fact</span><span>  |  that  Bowen  is  six  miles  away,  and</span><span>  I  if  you  don’t  like  his  beer—well,  you</span><span>  can  go  to  Bowen  and  get  other.</span><span>  I  Now,  Mr  Editor,  I  have  a  com</span><span>  plaint  to  make,  and  being  a  North</span><span>  erner,  I  don’t  mind  a  few  Sydney</span><span>  ites  coming  here  and  taking  away</span><span>  the  pickings,  both  from  the  butch</span><span>  ers!  floor  and  the  gut  department.</span><span>  Still,  I  must  object  to  nsn  like</span><span>  them,  drawing  between  £4  and  £6</span><span>  10s  a  week,  banging  on  to  the  lot</span><span>  and  trying  to  start  a  football  club  at</span><span>  our  expense,  or,  rather,  the  expense</span><span>  of  (he  married  people  of  Merinda.</span><span>  Then,  again,  do  you  think  mean</span><span>  ness  tends  to-  uplift  the  cause  of</span><span>  unionism,  for  all  these  men  are</span><span>  young,  able-bodied:  single  men,  who  |</span><span>  come  from  the  South,  They  want  I</span><span>  a  football  club.

That  they,  the  great</span><span>  Southern  mashers  are  condescend</span><span>  ing  enough  to  allow  their  lady  sym</span><span>  pathisers  to  go  from  bouse  to  house</span><span>  asking  or  begging  a  pound  of  but</span><span>  ter,  cake,  tea,  sugar,  or  biscuits,  etc,</span><span>  for  the  spread  to  be  given  at  the</span><span>  footballers’  dance  to  be  held  in  the</span><span>  School  of  Arts  at  Merinda-on  pay</span><span>  nlgbt.

"<p><span>  To  BUWKN  It  IYER  RACES</span><span>  BY  MOTOR  CAR.</span></p> <p><span>  On  Wednesday  morning  last</span><span>  Messrs  J.  Blaine,  J.  T.  Payne,  J.</span><span>  W.  Kirby,  and  W.  H.  Darwon  left</span><span>  town,for  Bowen  River  in  Mr  Me-</span></p> <p><span>  Briar’s  fine  Overland  Motor  Car,</span><span>  driven  by  the  owner.  When  such</span><span>  a  trip-was  first  mooted  it  was  the</span><span>  opinion  of  many  that  the  oar</span><span>  would  never  reach  its  destination</span><span>  and  wagers  were  made  on  the  re</span><span>  sult.  Among  the  doubtful  ones</span><span>  were  the  coach  drivers  who  knew</span><span>  the  bad  state  of  the  road  for  such</span><span>  an  undertaking.  Indications  oi</span><span>  the  previous  night  pointed  to  wet</span><span>  weather  light  showers  falling  on</span><span>  leaving  at  6  a.m.  and  continuing</span><span>  until  the.  sawmill  was  reached</span><span>  when  the  weather  cleared.  The</span><span>  little  band  of  motor  pioneers  bad</span><span>  grave  doubts  as  To  the  suooes  of</span><span>  the  trip  owing  to  the  showers  that</span><span>  had  fallen  but  these  were  dispelled</span><span>  after  the  Don  River  was  negotiated</span><span>  the  appearance  of  the  weather  hav</span><span>  ing  changed  for  the  better.  Leav</span><span>  ing  Mr  Blaine’s,  residence  at  5.55</span><span>  a.m,  a  good  run  was  made  to  An</span><span>  drews’crossing  of  the  Don  which</span><span>  was.  reached  at  6.35.  Here  the</span><span>  first  delay  occurred,  the  car  mak</span><span>  ing  good  headway  through  the  sand</span><span>  but  refusing  to  negotiate  the  water</span><span>  sticking  right  in  the  middip  of  it.</span><span>  Fortunately  the  distance  to  -  the</span><span>  other  side  was  short.  A  rope  was</span><span>  got  out  and  The  four  passengers</span><span>  whose  weight  '  totalled  about  57</span><span>  stone,  attached  themselves  to  it</span><span>  apd  after  one  had  missed  his  foot</span><span>  ing  and  came  down  on  the  stones  a</span><span>  grand  united  effort  by  men  and</span><span>  car  had  the  desired  effect,  after  a</span><span>  delay  of  I5  minutes.  A  good  run</span><span>  was  made  from  the  Don  to  Harriets</span><span>  Hotel  which  was  reached  at  y.50.</span><span>  After  enjoying  a  substantial  break</span><span>  fast  a  start  was  made  at  8.30,  the</span><span>  run  being  continuous  until  the  Bogie</span><span>  range  was  reached  where  a  slight</span><span>  delay  took  place  on  the  “pinch”</span><span>  shoulders  haying  to  be  put  to  the  car</span><span>  to  assist  on  this  really  bad  ascent;</span><span>  (road  party  wanted  here).  Eton</span><span>  Vale  was  reached  pt  10  a.m.,  the</span><span>  Bogie  Biver  being  crossed  in  10</span><span>  minutes  with  the  aid  of  canvas  and</span><span>  rope  and  a  strong  pull  or  two.</span><span>  After  a  nice  run  of  about  five  miles</span><span>  towards  Sandy  Creek  a  sound</span><span>  similar  to  the  explosion  of  a  pea</span><span>  rifle  bullet  denoted  that  a  tyre  had</span><span>  blown  out,  a  delay  of  10  minutes</span><span>  being  occasioned  in  putting  on  a</span><span>  new  one.  Another  delay  occurred</span><span>  at  the'first  Sandy  Creek  crossing</span><span>  through  the  party  not  being  aware</span><span>  of  a  deviation  in  the  road  to  avoid</span><span>  a  large  washout.  After  some  re</span><span>  connoitering  and  loss  of  time  the</span><span>  party-doubled  back  to  the  turn-off</span><span>  and  travelled  by  the  deviation</span><span>  (said  to  cost  £350  to  construct).</span><span>  The-  second  crossing  of  Sandy'</span><span>  Creek  caused  a  little,  trouble,  the</span><span>  team  having,  to  be  again  yoked  up.</span><span>  From  there  on  to  Strathmore  a  fine</span><span>  run  was  experienced,  that  station</span><span>  being  reached  at  1.30  p.m.  the  sur</span><span>  prise  of  the  inhabit  mts,  especially</span><span>  the  aboriginals,  being  great,  it  be</span><span>  ing  the  first  time  that'  a  -horseless</span><span>  carriage  had.  travelled  further  than</span><span>  the  Bpgie  on  this  road.  After  re</span><span>  galing  the  inner  man  a  start  was</span><span>  made  at  2.30  for  the  Bowen  River</span><span>  which  was  reached  in  good  time,</span><span>  and  a  halt  -made  in,  the  bed  7  the</span><span>  large  sand  banks  appearing  very</span><span>  formidable  objects.  Not  being</span><span>  able  to  obtain  horses  to  assist  the</span><span>  car  over  the  river  bipeds  had  to  be</span><span>  substituted,  a  muster  of  Bowenites,</span><span>  who  Were  Camped  on  the  opposite</span><span>  bank,  being  made.  So'  strong  was</span><span>  the  team  that  the  ropes  parted  and</span><span>  the  fall  of  Bowen’s  representatives</span><span>  was  great  including  as  it  did</span><span>  two  local  publicans',  a  photographer</span><span>  the  Press,  soft  drinks,  storekeeper,</span><span>  &0.,  &o.  A  few  long  and'strong</span><span>  pulls  saw  the  car  safely  over  the</span><span>  sand  and  away,  went  “Mao”  as</span><span>  pleased  as  punch,  up  the  steep</span><span>  grade  on  the  other  side-without  a</span><span>  halt.  -  The  distance  to  Harris’s</span><span>  Hotel,  by  cyclometer,  was  23</span><span>  miles  .  and  to  Strathmore  .63'#.  1</span><span>  miles.  Independent  of  the</span><span>  several  worxing  Shifts  at  the  differ</span><span>  ent  watercourses  the  trip  was  a</span><span>  very  'pleasant  one,  the  oar  being  a</span><span>  toy  in  the'clever  hands  of  Mr  Mc-</span><span>  Briar  and  only  ah  expert  cohid</span><span>  handle  it  so  successfully  over  -  bush</span><span>  roads  that  were  never  meant  for</span><span>  such  vehicles.  The  presence  of</span><span>  the.Car  at  the  Races  was  a  novelty</span><span>  and  was  _  greatly  appreciated,  the</span><span>  owner  being  kept  busy  for  two  days</span><span>  running  passengers  to  and  from</span><span>  the  racecourse  and  along  the  road</span><span>  to  Gap  Creek  By  the  aid  of  Mr</span><span>  W  Lynch,  who  assisted  to  get  the</span><span>  oar  over  with  a  couple  of  horses,  a</span><span>  start  was  made  on''  the  return</span><span>  journey  on  Friday  at  sundown  and</span><span>  the  run  made  to  Strathmore;  after</span><span>  lea’l  Leaving  Strathmore  at  6-30</span><span>  on  Saturday  morning  Table  Top</span><span>  was  reached  at  7-17  and  the  BOgie</span><span>  8-  the  car  negotiating  the'  river</span><span>  in  fine  style  in  minutes.  The</span><span>  Top’  of  the  range  was  reached  at</span><span>  9-  and  Harris’s  Hotel  at</span><span>  Notwithstanding  Hhe  early  hour</span><span>  Mrs  Harris  had  a  splendid  dinner</span><span>  prepared  for  the  motorists  which</span><span>  they  thoroughly  enjoyed,  making</span><span>  another  start  at  TO-5O  a  m.  A</span><span>  good  run  was  made  to  the  2-miie</span><span>  creek,  where  a  fine  mob  of  Havilah</span><span>  fats  was  passed  and  here  the  most</span><span>  serious  delay  of  the.  trip  was  met</span><span>  with,  there  being  a  large  amount</span><span>  of  drift  sand  washed  on  the  Bowen</span><span>  side  of  the  cutting  After  much</span><span>  manoevering  and  some  hard  graft</span><span>  the  motor  was  landed  on  the  top  of</span><span>  the  bank,-  half-an-hour  being  lost</span><span>  in  the  operation  The  “butter</span><span>  road”  being  very  rough  slow  pro</span><span>  gress  was  made  to  Pott’s  corner</span><span>  but  from  there  to  the  river  “Mao”</span><span>  opened  the  throttle  and  the  ear</span></p> <p><span>  fairly  flew  to  the  Don  which  was</span><span>  crossed  without  a  stoppage  and  the</span><span>  run  continued  right  into  town  which</span><span>  was  reached  at  r-15  p  m  The  dis></span><span>  tehees'  from  Strathmore  gate  were—</span><span>  Sandy  Creek  18#:  miles,  *  Bogie</span><span>  River  25#  miles'  Rosebank  Creek</span><span>  35  miles,  Harris’s  41  miles,  Bowen</span><span>  6.6#  miles  The  gentlemen  who</span><span>  made  the  trip  are  loud  in  their</span><span>  praises  of  Mr  Mcßriar’s  ability  as  a</span><span>  driver  and  are  of  the  opinion'  that</span><span>  with  a  little  attention  to  the</span><span>  roads'  motoring  to  ;the  Bowen</span><span>  River;  would  not  be  a  very</span><span>  tough  proposition</span></p> ",Article,1914-06-09,To BUWKN It IYER RACES BY MOTOR CAR.,192507582,2,2,"{'score': '117.00199', 'value': 'very relevant'}","On Wednesday morning last Messrs J.
