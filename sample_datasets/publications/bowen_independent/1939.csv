W.  RUSSELL,</span><span>  Mayor.</span></p> <p><span>  Dear  Sir.  —I  n  your  issue  of  the  5th</span><span>  April  appears  a  letter  over  the  signa</span><span>  ture  of  Dr.  Delamothe,  one  of  the</span><span>  Mayoral  candidates,  regarding  the  lay-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  of  pipes  under  bitumen  roadways</span><span>  and  stating  that  already  one  road  pro-,</span><span>  pared  for  bitumen  spraying  had  been</span><span>  dug  np  for  the  purpose  of  repairing  a</span><span>  leak  in  a  water  pipe.  Investigation  of</span><span>  this  statement  shows  the  necessity  for</span><span>  any  person,  before  criticising  the  ac</span><span>  tions  of  a  Council,  to  inquire  in  th«</span><span>  proper  quarter  as  to  what  Is  actually</span><span>  being  done.  In  this  particular  instance</span><span>  what  happened  was  that  a  quantify  of</span><span>  clayey  soil,  considered  to  be  unsuit</span><span>  able  for  good  road  formation  had  been</span><span>  deposited  in  the  road  In  one  spot,  and</span><span>  the  foreman  upon  inspection  had  or</span><span>  dered  it  to  he  dug  out  and  the  proper</span><span>  gravel  put  in  its  place.  Therefore  the</span><span>  question  of  a  leaky  water  pipe  does</span><span>  not  come  into  the  argument.</span><span>  Regarding  the  dilliculty  experienced</span><span>  by  every  Local  Authority  in  connec</span><span>  tion  with  water  mains  and  the  modern</span><span>  types  of  roadways  many  cities  through</span><span>  out  the  world  are  now  adopting  the</span><span>  expensive  method  of  laying  water</span><span>  mains  tinder  the  footpath  on  each  side</span><span>  of  the  road,  but  such  a  method  is  ob</span><span>  viously  far  beyond  the  llnancial  re</span><span>  sources  of  most  towns  in  Australia,  lot</span><span>  alone  Bowen.

The  position  of  house  »cr</span><span>  vice  pipes  unfortunately  could  not  lie</span><span>  overcome  and  they,  must  go  under  the</span><span>  bitumen,  but  plumbers,  when  carrying</span><span>  out  repairs  to  these  pipes  must  make</span><span>  good  all  damage  to  the  roads  and  the</span><span>  cost  to  the  Council  is  nil.</span><span>  If  anyone  can  invent  an  economical</span><span>  method  of  conveying  water  from  one</span><span>  side  of  tlie  road  to  the  other  to  serve</span><span>  householders  wlihout  going  under  the</span><span>  road,  he  will  confer  a  blessing  on  all</span><span>  witter  authorities.</span><span>  Dr  Delamothe  says  something  about</span><span>  a  “time-honoured  and  hewhlskered</span><span>  idea”  for  an  outgoing  Council  to  save</span><span>  much  of  its  money  for  a  final  splurge</span><span>  in  the  last  few  weeks  of  its  life.

During  the  whole  time  Tom</span><span>  has  represented  us  in  season  and  out</span><span>  of  season  his  first  consideration  has</span><span>  been  to  put  an  extra  penny  in  the</span><span>  pockets  of  winegrowers  ns  such  and</span><span>  with  what  results  (which  after  all  is</span><span>  what  counts  with  us)  :  He  has  put  hun</span><span>  dreds  of  thousands  of  pounds  in  the</span><span>  winegrowers’  pockets.

Some  of  this</span><span>  -talk  has  been  constructive,  and  some</span><span>  very  definitely  just  the  opposite.  -With</span><span>  in  the  lastiiew  months,  quite  an  un</span><span>  necessary;  amount  of  prejudice  .  also</span><span>  has  come-  to  the  fore  with  players  in</span><span>  the  Town,  who  could  bo  useful  Bands</span><span>  men.  Some  plead  oiio  thing  and  some</span><span>  another  as;a  reason  for  staying  away</span><span>  from  practices  ana  public  perform</span><span>  ances.  Most  of  the  trouble  with  thesj</span><span>  people  really  is,  that  they  are  not  pre-,</span><span>  pared  tojdo  .the  ground  work  first.,</span><span>  Thev  .exnecl:  (qjje.

There.  is  another  class</span><span>  (thank  Heaven)  that  is  the  backbone</span><span>  of  the  Band.;  This  class  is  the  true</span><span>  Bandsman.  He  is  .there  when  he  is</span><span>  wanted.  Any  ’Conductor  knows  this</span><span>  man’s  value  to  his  Band.  For  the</span><span>  whole-hearted  support  and  co-opera</span><span>  tion  that  I  have  received  from  these</span><span>  Bandsmen,  I  feel  that  I  would  like  to</span><span>  publicly  thank  them  for  helping  to</span><span>  make  a  pleasant  recreation  out  of  a</span><span>  thankless  job,.such  as  mine  was:  and</span><span>  at-  times,.  I  hope  they  felt  with  me.  a</span><span>  certain  pride  in  the  knowledge  that</span><span>  we  could,  and-did,  when  called  upon,</span><span>  rise""  above  bur  .obstacles  and  give  a</span><span>  really  creditable  public  performance.</span><span>  They.'have-.tried,  with  me,  to  keep  the</span><span>  Band  alive’lilfd-  a  public--  asset,  ami</span><span>  they  agree  also  that  the.  time  has</span><span>  come  to  refer  the  whole  matter  to  the</span><span>  public  for  anyexpression  of  opinion,  if</span><span>  it,  really  Inis,  one,-  and  go  into  recess</span><span>  indefinitely;  to  reorganise  if  mid  who  l  ,</span><span>  sufficient'support  is  offering.  If  the</span><span>  Public  of  Bowen  want  a  Band,  then</span><span>  they  must  be  prepared  to  give  it  mor</span><span>  al  as  well;  as'financial  support.  These</span><span>  two  factors  -represent,  to  a  Band,  what</span><span>  food  and'warmth  are  to  us  as  individ</span><span>  uals.  Without  either,  we  go  under.  So</span><span>  I  would  suggest  ■  that  you  consider</span><span>  without  prejudice,  whether  you  want</span><span>  a  Band  or  not.  If  you  consider  that</span><span>  the  Town  should  have  a  Band,  then  1</span><span>  would  suggest  that  you  try  some  action</span><span>  first;-and  when  this  bears  fruit,  a</span><span>  little  talking.’  will  be  pardonable.  Any</span><span>  constructive  expression  of  opinion  re</span><span>  garding  the  Band’s  existence  will,  I  am</span><span>  sure,  bo  appreciated  by  those  who</span><span>  have  voluntarily  accepted  the  manage</span><span>  ment  of  it’silf  fairs,  and  these  columns</span><span>  would  be  a  good  place  to  express  that</span><span>  opinion.</span></p> ",Article,1939-07-12,"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THE BOWEN TOWN BAND.

I  have</span><span>  worked  on.  bijilflings  in  North  Queens</span><span>  land  for-the  past  thirty  years,  some  of</span><span>  which  were  very”'big  jobs.  I  have</span><span>  never  had  :  the  sack  off  a  building  in</span><span>  my.life.  I  will  deal  with  my  work  on</span><span>  (he  baths  later  In-this  letter.

Had'  thOy  been  given  a  cor</span><span>  rect.  Tend  they  wduld  have  given  a</span><span>  decent  account  of  themselves.  No,</span><span>  Mr.  Elector,  there  is  no  share  of  the</span><span>  blame  to  be  plaejsd  on  the  shoulders</span><span>  of  the  labourers  J:  for  that  disgraceful</span><span>  £12,500  muddle.</span><span>  Now  for  .the  ..part  that,  I  played  in</span><span>  .the  band,  When  I  was  first  picked  up</span><span>  for:  the  job  as  .bricklayer,.  I  protested</span><span>  to  tlie  foreman  regarding  the  material</span><span>  lie  called  bricks...  They  were  concrete</span><span>  slabs  measuring,  20in.  ,x  iOin,  x  4in„.</span><span>  which  would  have,  been  O.K.  had  they</span><span>  been  properly  made.  When  I  began</span><span>  to  work  them  discovered  that  they</span><span>  were  without  .exception  Tin.  to  lin,</span><span>  out  of  square,  and  varying  in  thick</span><span>  ness  from  B|.  to  4i  inches.</span><span>  I  was  told  to'  mnke  a-struck  work</span><span>  job  inside  andl,outside,  which  was  an</span><span>  impossibility,  without  having  to  cut</span><span>  almost  every  brick.  The  most  inex</span><span>  perienced  perspu:  will  readily  see  that</span><span>  the  cutting  of  jail  those  concrete  slabs</span><span>  must  entail  a  tremendous  amount  of</span><span>  uunnecessary  work.  However,  I  car</span><span>  ried  on  for  sixuhours  and  then  threw</span><span>  the,  job  in  -disgust.  Nine  or  ten'days</span><span>  later,  while  ip  company  with  another</span><span>  man,  ’tlte..Engin^i!.'.BtWPe9:y,  :  il>e..  and</span><span>  said  “Wle  are-in-a,  difficulty  regarding</span><span>  the  brickwork  at  the  baths.”  He  then</span><span>  asked  me  to.reconsider  my  decision.  I</span><span>  pointed  out  to  iiim  how  unsatisfactory</span><span>  it  was  for  me  to  work  with  badly  made</span><span>  concrete,  bricks.  He  replied  “I  know</span><span>  it  is  not  a  good  job,  but  you  are  the</span><span>  only  man  we;  know  l  of  here,  to  do  the</span><span>  work.  If  you  agree  you  :  need  not  cut  all</span><span>  of  the.  bricks,  as  it.  will.be  a-plastered</span><span>  job.  All  you  need  do  Is,  fill  the  joints.”</span><span>  Uiider  those  conditions  I  agreed  to  do</span><span>  the  brickwork;</span><span>  I  re-commenced  the  following  morn</span><span>  ing  and  finished  the  whole  of  the</span><span>  brickwork  in  five  weeks.  To  give  you</span><span>  an  Idea  of  the  amount  of  work,  I  will</span><span>  give  you  the;  dimensions  of  the  build</span><span>  ing.  There  were  two  walls  front  and</span><span>  back  93ft.  x  Sft.  Oln.  each,  and  five</span><span>  cross  walls,  including  the  two  ends,'</span><span>  each  20ft.  x'S£b.'  ;  6ln.—a  fairly  large</span><span>  building.  The  amount  of  money  I  re</span><span>  ceived  for  that  work  was  less  than</span><span>  £35.  I  received  the  bare  award  rates.</span><span>  Another  misleading  statement  was</span><span>  made  by  Alderman  Michael  regarding</span><span>  a  door  that  had  been  missed,  and  had</span><span>  to  bo  cut  out  of  the  solid  concrete</span><span>  brick  wall.  The  :  facts  -  are  simply</span><span>  these.  A  door  on  the  S.B.  corner  of</span><span>  the  building  was  missed  until  the  wall</span><span>  was  up  two  course,  when  it  was  notic</span><span>  ed.  After  a  consultation  with  the</span><span>  foreman  it  was.  decided  to  leave  the</span><span>  two  course  intact,  but  to  set  back</span><span>  from  here,  was  -done.  However,</span><span>  the  mistake  entailed  the  cutting  out</span><span>  of  four  bricks,  and  was  rectified  at  a</span><span>  cost,  of  about)  1  1/-,:’.which,  is  a  very</span><span>  small  percentage'  of  the  £T,500  deficit.</span><span>  Another  misleading  statement  was</span><span>  made  by  ,  He  said</span><span>  the  reason  the  offices  were  put  up  in</span><span>  concrete  was  on,  account  of  their  in</span><span>  ability  to  secure  a  competent  brick</span><span>  layer,  Tlie  real  facts  are  as  I  have</span><span>  already  pointed  out,  was  their  inability</span><span>  to  make  a  reasonably  good  concrete</span><span>  slab  for  the-work.  .If  such  was  not</span><span>  the  case,  why  did  the  Council  import</span><span>  from  Jlackay  some  thousands  of  con</span><span>  crete  slabs  measuring  iSin.  x  181n.  x</span><span>  2in.  to  pave  the  ■  walks  around  the</span><span>  swimming  pools..  The  whole  of  the</span><span>  material  to  make  those  slabs  is  avail</span><span>  able  in  this  district.  The  foregoing  is</span><span>  an  inexcusable  waste  of  public  money,</span><span>  Lawlor  was  a  member  of  the  Works</span><span>  Committee  that  sanctioned  it.</span><span>  I  have  no  hesitation  in  saying  that</span><span>  there  is  no  body,  of  men  in  Queensland</span><span>  that  would  attempt  an  undertaking</span><span>  like  -Bowen>  Baths-with-sueh  a  jerry</span><span>  builder’s  working  plant  as  the  Bowen</span><span>  Council  had.  .</span><span>  Having  disposed  of  th,-  complaints</span><span>  already  made,  t  now  intend  to  deal</span><span>  briefly  with  sum-  of  the  faults  that</span><span>  Council  members  arul'Vl-.eii-  .-ifib-ers  do</span><span>  not  make  public.</span><span>  The  first  is  when  the  exeavaikm  -m.</span><span>  1  finished,  and  :  na'embnubio-.ar  v>  icci</span></p> <p><span>  high  was  completed.  Some  wag  woke</span><span>  up  that  they  had  forgotten-  to  instnl</span><span>  a  line  of  pipes  at  the  bottom  of  em</span><span>  bankment,  with  the  result  that  the</span><span>  embankment  had  to  be  excavated  and</span><span>  ttie  pipes  Installed,  an  item  which</span><span>  caused  at  least  £lOO  loss.  I  ask  you,</span><span>  Mr  Elector,  should  that  loss  be  attrib</span><span>  uted  to  the  labourers  or  bosses.</span><span>  The  next  Is  the  mistake  in  the  scum</span><span>  gutter'at  top  of  the  big  pool.  It  ap</span><span>  pears  that  the  engineer  and  his  fore</span><span>  man  made,  a  mistake  in  the  levels,  a</span><span>  mistake  that  cost  about  £3OO  to  cor</span><span>  rect.  The  responsibility  for  that  loss</span><span>  must  be  accepted  by  the  persons  men</span><span>  tioned  and  the  Wbrks  Committee  on</span><span>  account  of  their  neglecting  to  check</span><span>  up  on  the  work.</span><span>  ;  There  are  other  items  I-  intend  to</span><span>  refer'to  in  a  future  letter.

The  sand  which  lie  refers</span><span>  to  is  a  fine  decomposed  granite  gravel</span><span>  with  a  small  percentage  of  iron  in  it.</span><span>  which  helps  to  compact  the  gravel  and</span><span>  make  it  practically  a  natural  cement.</span><span>  It,  is  very  clean  in  wet  weather  and</span><span>  does  not.  pick  up  on  the  'wheels  of  ve</span><span>  hicles,  nnd  once  it.  is  properly  set  does</span><span>  not  score  to  any  extent.

If  four  fifths  of  a</span><span>  certain  sum  of  money  is  spent  in  thirty</span><span>  five  months,  how  can  the  remaining</span><span>  one-fifth  be  spent  in  one  month,,  when</span><span>  less  labour  is  employed  weekly  than  in</span><span>  the  thirty-five  months?

L.TONES,</span><span>  Secretary,  Bowen  Consolidated  Branch</span><span>  Q.  C,  E.  Union,  Scottville.</span></p> <p><span>  Dear  Sir,—The  dispute  arose  at  Bo</span><span>  wen  Consolidated  coal  Mine  over  the</span><span>  employment  of  a  boy.  For  a  number  of</span><span>  years  past,  a  list  has  been  in  operation</span></p> <p><span></span><span>  at  this  Colliery.  The  Manager  has  al-.</span><span>  ways  recognised  this  list.,  until  the  oc</span><span>  curence  of  this  Dispute,  when  he  said,</span><span>  he  definitely  would  not  recognise  any</span><span>  list  and  would  give  employment  to</span><span>  whoever  he  wished.  The  Brandi  objec</span><span>  ted  to  tills  procedure  as  the  manager</span><span>  was  showing  favouritism  to  the  indiv</span><span>  iduals  he  Intended,  employing.  As  a  re</span><span>  sult  of  our  objection,  we  have  been</span><span>  locked  out  by  the  Management  who  in</span><span>  tends  starving  ns  into  submission.  We</span><span>  have,  always  been  willing  and  ready  to</span><span>  go  back  to  work  under  pre-stoppage</span><span>  conditions,  but  have  never  been  given</span><span>  tlie  chance.  Humour  is  very  rife  in</span><span>  tbls  District,  that  the  members  of  this</span><span>  Mine  do  not  want  to  go  hack  to  work,</span><span>  so  therefore,  we  the  members  of  the</span><span>  Branch  wish  to  contradict  these  rum</span><span>  ours.  In-  a  phone  conversation  between</span><span>  myself,  aha  the  Chairman  of  Directors</span><span>  I  -informed  .bleu  -.that  we  had  always</span><span>  been  prepared  to,  resume  work  under</span><span>  pre-stoppage  conditions:  but  he  did  not</span><span>  seem  to  understand  what  pre-stoppage</span><span>  conditions  were:  as  lie  said  if  we  went</span><span>  back  to  work  tomorrow  the  Manager</span><span>  would  still  be  able  to  employ  the  boy</span><span>  in  dispute,  but  I  informed  him  that</span><span>  that  was  not  pre-stoppage  conditions',</span><span>  but  he  was  unable  to  see  this.  I  ex</span><span>  plained  that  we  were  prepared  to  go</span><span>  back  to  work  and  that  the  Manager</span><span>  employ  no  new  labour  pending  the  de</span><span>  cision,  of  the  Arbitration  Court,  but  he</span><span>  ruled  otherwise,  and  as  a  result  we  are</span><span>  still  idle.  -  The  hoy  who  is,  first  on  the</span><span>  list  has  been  practically  victimised,  as</span><span>  we  wanted  the  Manager  to  give  the</span><span>  boy  a  month’s  trial  and  if  he  did  not</span><span>  suit  or  could  uotiflo  the  work  we  would</span><span>  raiseruo:  objections  to  him  putting  him</span><span>  off  and  allowing;  him  to  take  his  place</span><span>  at  the  bottom  of  the  list,  we  even  of</span><span>  fered  to  give  the.  Manager  a  statement</span><span>  in  writing  to  that  effect,  but  he  would</span><span>  not  accept'the  offer,  as  he  contends</span><span>  the  boy  is  lazy  anj  incompetent.  This</span><span>  is  rather  a  remarkable  statement  to</span><span>  make  when  he  has  never  seen  the  boy</span><span>  working.  The  boy  he  is  desirous  of</span><span>  starting  is  second  on  the  list  and  was</span><span>  in  employment  prior  to  the  ‘  dispute.</span><span>  This  boy  has  given  the  Manager  Ids  as</span><span>  surance  that  ho  is  not  desirous  of  tak</span><span>  ing  a  job  at  the  Mine  until  the  other</span><span>  boy  is  found  employment  there,  but</span><span>  the  Manager  is  not  prepared  to  accept</span><span>  this  either,  demonstrating  that  he  is</span><span>  trying  to  starve  us  into  submission.  On</span><span>  the  last  occasion  i  that  the  Committee</span><span>  visited  at  the  office,  ami</span><span>  informed  hiui'of  the  desire  of  the  boj</span><span>  hot  to  accept'the  position  until  the</span><span>  other  boy  was  started,  he  told  us  tc</span><span>  clear  to  Hell  and  not  to  come  back  un</span><span>  til,  we  were.'prepared  to  give  Idm  his</span><span>  own  way  in  the  matter.</span></p> ",Article,1939-07-28,"LETTER TO THE EDITOR Scottville N.Q., 24/7/39.

"<p><span>  Bowen  Chamber  of  Commerce.</span></p> <p><span>  ANNUAL  REPORT</span><span>  FOR  THE  YEAR  ENDED  30TH  SEPTEMBER,  1939.</span><span>  TO  THE  MEMBERS,</span></p> <p><span>  R.  A.  KELSEY.</span><span>  President.</span></p> <p><span>  I  have  pleasure  in  presenting  our  annual  report  in  respect  of  the</span><span>  year  ended  30th  September.  1939.  Since  I  last  so  addressed  you  there  has</span><span>  been  a  grunt,  change  in  world  affairs.  Germany's  continued  ruthless</span><span>  aggression  has  at  last  resulted  in  what  we  all  hoped  would  be  avoided—</span></p> <p><span>  war.  With  other  British  dominions  wo  are  supporting  the  Mother  Country</span><span>  ■and  her  Ally—France,  in  this  struggle  for  world  freedom.  All  our  re</span><span>  sources  in  men.  ships  and  produce  are  being:  marshalled  for  the  defence  of</span><span>  Australia  and  assistance  to  Great  Britain.  There  is  so  far,  1  am  thankful</span><span>  to  say,  no  direct  threat  of  Invasion  of  Australia,  but  what  the  future  may</span><span>  hold  in  store  for  our  country  is  unpredictable  and  so  our  Federal  Govern</span><span>  ment.  is  wisely  providing  against  all  possible  contingencies  by  building  up</span><span>  a  strong  army  and  air  force.</span><span>  Whilst  we  are  ail  sanguine  as  to  the  ultimate  result  of  this  struggle</span><span>  we  also  realise  that  before  the  end  is  reached  great  sacrifices  will  have</span><span>  been  endured  at  home  and  abroad.  The  position  Is  faced  with  a  spirit</span><span>  and  determination  to  rid  the  world  of  the  tyranny  of  Nazism  and  to</span><span>  restore  to  those  victims  of  stark  and  traitorous  aggression  in  Europe  their</span><span>  lost  independence.</span><span>  This  resolution  has  a  common  inspiration  throughout  the  British  Empire</span><span>  whose  j)eopio  will  realise  the  wonderful  patience  and  self  control  exercis</span><span>  ed  by  tlio  Mother  Country  in  efforts  to  find  peaceful  solutions  of  inter</span><span>  national  problems  as  opposed  to  brute  force.  Bike  the  last  this  war  is</span><span>  none  of  our  seeking  but  since  we  are  forced  to  defend  ourselves  against</span><span>  the-throat  of  world  domination  it  is  unlikely  that  any  pence  will  be  reach</span><span>  ed  until  that,  threat  is  completely  eliminated.  It  Is  good  to  note  that  in</span><span>  these  efforts  we  have  the  moral  and,  in.  many  cases,  the  active  support  of</span><span>  most  nations  throughout  the  world.</span><span>  I  feel  it  is  fit  as  a  preamble  to  our  annual  report  to  make  the  foregoing</span><span>  few  observations  on  conditions  so  vitally  affecting  our  social,  commercial</span><span>  and  economic  well  being,</span><span>  Tlie  comprehensive  list,  of  subjects  attracting  the  attention  of  the</span><span>  Chamber  throughout  the  year  is  a  reflection  of  the  expansion  and  -prosper</span><span>  ity  of  our  district  and  is  such  as  to  inspire  confidence  in  the  future.</span><span>  FARMING.</span><span>  ..Although  the  rainfall  for  the  year  was  on  the  light  side,  showing  a</span><span>  total  of  only  1942  points  for  the  ten  'months  ended  October,  the  man  on</span><span>  the-  hind  enjoyed  a  fairly  prosiierous  season.  Production  was  lighter  com</span><span>  pared  to  the  previous  season,  but  tills  was  well  offsetted  by  better  market</span><span>  ing,  conditions.  film  following  figures  of  exports  were  kindly  supplied  by</span><span>  our-two  local  organisations.  For  the  nine  months  ended  September  the</span><span>  Bowyn  Fruit.  Export  Company  exported  813.-171  packages  of  tomatoes,</span><span>  cucumbers,  pineapples,  pumpkins,  etc.,  as  compared  to  239,187  for  the</span><span>  corresponding  period  of  last  yea)  -  ,  while  the  relative  figures  for  the</span><span>  Committee  of  Direction  were  93,170  packages  compared  to  120,405  for  the</span><span>  preceding  period.</span><span>  COAL.</span><span>  For  the  year  ended  30th  .Tune  1039,  the  Bowen  Coalfield  produced</span><span>  2171015  tons  of  coal  made  up  from  158.412  tons  from  the  Bowen  State  Mine</span><span>  and""sB;oo3  tons  from  the  Bowen  Consolidated  Colliery,  Employment  in</span><span>  these  two  collieries;  is  provided  for  upwards  of  380  men.  The  Bowen  Coke</span><span>  Works,  operated  by  the  Government,  treats  approximately  .50,000  ■</span><span>  tons  of  coal  annually  for  a  return  of  around  (M  l  per  cent  of  coke.  Prin</span><span>  cipal  consumers-are  the  Mount  Isa  Company  and  the  State  Smulturs  v  ....</span><span>  salt.  -  V  v</span><span>  Following  a  .harvest  of  9,000  tons  for  the  1938  season,  the  Bowen</span><span>  Salt,  Company  had  over  18000  tons  of  salt  in  its  storage  sheds.  There  is</span><span>  abundance  of  salt  already  available  for  lids  season’s  harvest  but  the</span><span>  actual  tonnage  garnered  will  depend  upon  the  extent  of  stora'ge-room</span><span>  available,.  This  Company  has  been  paying  an  annual  dividend  of  7  per</span><span>  cent  on  ifs  Capital.</span><span>  BOWEN  FREEZING  WORKS.</span><span>  These  Works  at  date  of  fids  report  are  still  o|>erating  and  will</span><span>  probably  continue  for  another  month  When  it  is  estimated  about  3(1.500</span><span>  .  head  of  cattle  will  have  been  treated  compared  with  31,100  head  for  the</span><span>  1938  season.</span><span>  .  MAIN.  ROADS.</span><span>  Construction  lias  been  continued  on  the  road  between  Bowen  and</span><span>  Home  Hill  and  good  fra  tile  conditions  are  now  in  evidence  over  most  of</span><span>  the  route.  It  is  estimated  that  this  road  will  lie  completed  in  about  18</span><span>  months.  Nothing  so  far  has  been  done  on  flic  road  between-  Bowen  and</span><span>  Proserpine  which  Is  in  a  deplorable  condition.  It  is  understood  that  the</span><span>  Main  Roads  Commission  has  this  section  listed  for  attention  in  the  near</span><span>  future.  Road  conditions  between  Bowen  and  the  Bowen  Coalfield  remain</span><span>  laid.  It  is  likely  that:  (Tie  road  recently  constructed  to  the  Upper  Don  will</span><span>  he  utilised  as  a  section  of  n  now  route  via  Mossvale  to  Collinsville  which</span><span>  will  greatly  Improve  travelling  conditions.  Tills  road  no  doubt  will  even</span><span>  tually  serve  as'a  feeder  to  the  Inland  road  from  Brisbane  to  Charters</span><span>  Towers  now  listed  for  construction  for  defence  purposes,</span><span>  AERODROME.</span><span>  The  gravelling  of  runways  on  the  aerodrome  permits  of  landings  in  alt</span><span>  weathers.  Following  the  substitution  of  ""Douglas”  for  -  “Stinson”'  aircraft</span><span>  on  the  northern  service  Bowen  was  deprived  of  its  daily  service  but  a</span><span>  change  back  to  “Stinson”  machines  has  restored  this  service,  and  we  are</span><span>  again  enjoying  a  mail  and  passenger  service  north  and  south  daily.</span><span>  PUBLIC  BATHS.</span><span>  The  original  estimate  of  £BOOO  for  our  baths  was  found  to  be</span><span>  inadequate  and  a  further  loan  of  £2OOO  was  obtained.  This  too  proved</span><span>  insufficient  and  construction  has  been  at:  a  standstill  for  some  time  pend</span><span>  ing  the  result  of  representation  for  another  loan  of  £1250.  It  has  been</span><span>  announced  this  further  amount  lias  been  granted  and  so  it  is  probable</span><span>  construction  will  be  resumed  at  a  early  date.</span><span>  GENERAL.  .</span><span>  Attention  was  devoted  to  matters  relating  to  postal,  railway,  school</span><span>  and  other  services  during  the  year.  '</span><span>  Consideration  was  given  to  the  possibility  of  a  factory  being  established</span><span>  here  for  the  processing  of  fruit  and  vegetables.  The  jiroduction  of  oil</span><span>  from  coal  to  till  a  national  need  in  time,  of  war  was  again  advocated</span><span>  Representations  outlining  the  facilities  offering  at  Bowen  in  respect  of</span><span>  the  establishment,  of  works  in  North  Queensland  for  manufacture  of</span><span>  superphosphate  fertiliser  were  made  to  Mount  Isa  Mines  Limited  which</span><span>  company  was  considering  the  question  of  undertaking  such  a  project.</span><span>  In  submitting  resolutions  for  debate  at  the  annual  Conference  of</span><span>  Queensland  Chambers,  the  Chamber  advocated  taxation  on  u  wealth</span><span>  scale  for  the  upkeep  of  hospitals  in  preference  to  the  present  inequitable</span><span>  (method  of  land  taxation.  A  resolution  dealing  with  the  tendency  to</span><span>  segregation  of  our  alien  population.  Advocacy  of  the  more  general  use  of</span><span>  pulverised  coal  In  lieu  of  oil.  Excessive  charges  in  respect  of  postal  and</span><span>  telephone  services  and  recommendations  for  expediting  the  construction</span><span>  of  the  Pacific  highway.  Unfortunately,  on  account  of  the  outbreak  of  war,</span><span>  it  was  deemed  advisable  to  abandon  the  conference  on  this  occasion.</span><span>  In  concluding  tills  report,  I  desire  to  (hank  our  State  member,  Mr.</span><span>  E,  J.  Rlordan  and  our  Federal  member,  Mr.  G.  Martens,  for  attention  to</span><span>  matters  submitted  to  them  from  time  to  time.

"<p><span>  IS  SHARK  FISHING</span><span>  WORTH  WHILE?</span></p> <p><span>  AND  THAT  ROARING  SHARK.</span></p> <p><span>  (By  NORMAN  CALDWELL)</span></p> <p><span>  I  was  very  interested  to  read  in  the</span><span>  “Independent”  of  the  catch  made,  when</span><span>  fishing  at  Bald  Hills.  by  Messrs.  Doug.</span><span>  and  Ray  jensen  and  Roy  Smith.  I</span></p> <p><span></span><span>  .Was  a  shark,  but  n  stranger  to  tin:</span><span>  Hi  roe  anglers.  As  a  rule  most,  sharks</span><span>  aro  easily  identified.  The  tiger.by  its</span><span>  faint  body  stripes,  the-whaler  by  the</span><span>  large  triangular  serrated  teeth,  and'</span><span>  half-inoop.  shaped  jaw.  The  school</span><span>  shark  by  its  black  lipped  fins,  and  the</span><span>  hammerhead.,  as  the  name  denotes,  by</span><span>  (be  peculiar  shape  of  the  bead.</span><span>  The,  shark  that  I  llrst  mentioned</span><span>  certainly  claims,  -  relationship,  with</span><span>  Xelrrodes  Concolor  Ogilvii,  a  fairly</span><span>  rare  •  species.  During  the  last  six</span><span>  years.  I  have  only  captured  four  off</span><span>  Grassy  .Island.  1  cannot  claim,  though,</span><span>  to  have  heard  them  make  a  loud  noise</span><span>  equal  In  volume  (o  a  man’s  shout,  but</span><span>  they  certainly  did  groan  /  and  spurt</span><span>  water  from  the.mouth,  something  ho</span><span>  respectable  shark  would  do.  There  is</span><span>  always  something  fascinating  about</span><span>  .shark  fishing.  .  Scientists  claim  that</span><span>  sharks  are  the  oldest  known  fish.</span><span>  That,  in  the  early  history  of  the  world,</span><span>  they  belonged  to  the  land.  The  pec</span><span>  toral  tins  once  were  forelegs,  and  the</span><span>  anal  dm;,  hind  legs.  Maybe,  but  now</span><span>  the  tanners  have  renlieed  the-value,</span><span>  of  .  shark  hides  for  leather,  and  cliem</span><span>  'shark  will  'gradually  be  classed'  ns  a</span><span>  money-maker  in  the  future.  The  flesh</span><span>  when  dehydrated  has  a  protein  content</span><span>  of  SB,t)  per  cent.  This  alone  makes  it.</span><span>  a  wonderful  food  asset  for  pig  and</span><span>  cattle  farmers.  The  Chinese  buy  the</span><span>  (Ins—for  soup.  My  hook  “Fangs  of</span><span>  of  the  Sea,’’  gives  the  value  of  a  odd</span><span>  lb.  whaler  shark,  after  deducting</span><span>  working  expenses,  as  £2/7/0.  And</span><span>  whaler  sharks  are  common  in  Barrier</span><span>  Beef  waters,  but  one  must  realise  flatt</span><span>  a  lot  has  to  be  done  with  the  shark  to</span><span>  make  it.  a'marketable  product.  It.  is</span><span>  no  use  starting  to  catch  sharks  unless</span><span>  one  has  (1)  the  cheapest  method  of</span><span>  treatment;  (2)  the  markets  where  the</span><span>  by-products  can  be  sold.  I  have  re</span><span>  ceived  .many  letters  from  men  who</span><span>  have  the  idea  that,  once  a  shark  is</span><span>  caught  it  can  bo  converted  into  ready</span><span>  cash  at  once.  It  cannot.  Several  pro</span><span>  cesses  have  to  be  gone  through.  (I)</span><span>  The  tins  removed.  (2)  The  hide  care</span><span>  fully  cut  away.  (3)  The  livers  re</span><span>  served  for  rendering  into  oil.  and  the</span><span>  (lesh  put  aside  for  drying,  leaving  the</span><span>  offal  and  spare  parts  '.for■■'the  fertiliser</span><span>  plant.  And  this  can  only  he  done  by</span><span>  experts.  So  unless  one  Inis  snllicienl</span><span>  capital  and  the  right  plant,  f  do  not</span><span>  ;  advise  fishermen  to  calch  sharks  for</span><span>  profit.</span><span>  The  hide  itself  is  somewhat  a  prob</span><span>  lem.  It  is  covered  with  minute  chalky</span><span>  mounds.  These  have  to  be  removed  by</span><span>  an  acid  process  before  the  hides  can</span><span>  he  tanned.  Tins  alone  puts  shark</span><span>  leather  out  of  the  reach  of  the  ordin</span><span>  ary  fisherman.  Tim  oil,  which  is</span><span>  heavily  impregnated  with  stearin,  is</span><span>  filtered  by  a  special  process,  but  the</span><span>  stearin  must  be  out  of  the  oil  before</span><span>  sales  can  eventuate.</span><span>  Kveu  (ho  ling  have  a  special  treat</span><span>  ment,  but  they  fetch  a  good  price  in</span><span>  Ghlna,  where  they  are  considered  a</span><span>  delicacy.</span><span>  Netting  or  meshing,  is  the  only  prov</span><span>  en  way  for  catching  sharks  in  large</span><span>  numbers,  apd  New  South  Wales  waters</span><span>  have  yielded  ns  many  as  210  sharks,</span><span>  lu  one  night,  and  in  two  nets.</span><span>  Great  Barrier  Beef  waters  can  do</span><span>  better  than  that.

Coun</span><span>  cillors  Bishop  and  6.  Pott  seem  to  be</span><span>  the  complainants.

ScottvlUe,  2/8/38.</span><span>  To  the  Editor,</span><span>  Bowen  Independent,</span><span>  Dear  Sir,—.  With  further  reference</span><span>  to  the  dispute  at  Consolidated  Colliery,</span><span>  Scottville,  I  wish  to  state  that  on  the</span><span>  Ist  August,  a  Union  Official  from  the</span><span>  South  arrived  on  the  field,  to  gain</span><span>  first  hand  information-  ana  if  possible</span><span>  effect  a  settlement.  At  a  meeting  it</span><span>  was  decided  that  the  local  committee</span><span>  accompany  the  Union  official  for  Inter</span><span>  view  with  manager.  This  official  point</span><span>  ed  out  to  him  that  the  men  were,  and</span><span>  always  have  been  willing  to  resume</span><span>  work  on  pre-stoppage  conditions,  and</span><span>  that  he,  the  manager,  was  committing</span><span>  a  breach  of  Clause  57  of  the  Award  by</span><span>  not  opening  the  Mine;  The  official</span><span>  then  rea&lt;x  of  the  Award  which  is  as</span><span>  follows:  ""When  a  dispute  occurs  at</span><span>  any  colliery  which  cannot  be  settled  by</span><span>  the  Manager,  Overman,  and  Scrutin</span><span>  eers,  work  shall  proceed  under  the  con</span><span>  ditions  prevailing  before  the  dispute</span><span>  occurred,  and  the  dispute  shall  immed</span><span>  iately  be  referred  to  the  Conciliation</span><span>  Board.  The  Manager  then  said  that</span><span>  Mr.  Conway,  Manager  of  .  the  State</span><span>  Mine,  told  him  he  takes  men  from  the</span><span>  list  for  employment  only  if  they  suit</span><span>  him.  The  local  committee,  emphatic</span><span>  ally  denied  this  statement  and  chal</span><span>  lenged  the  manager  to  prove  It.  The</span><span>  Manager  then  asked  the  committee,  if</span><span>  the  matter  went  to  Court  would  they</span><span>  abide  by  its  decision.  The  Committee</span><span>  considered  this  question,  not  only</span><span>  cheeky  and  insolent  but  rather  comical</span><span>  seeing  that  he  is  reserving  the  right  to</span><span>  break  the  Court’s  ruling  by  not  .obey</span><span>  ing  Clause  57.  However  the  committee</span><span>  pointed  out  that  if  the  Court  gave  a</span><span>  decision,  it  also  had  the  necessary  pow</span><span>  er  to  enforce  its  decision  being  carried</span><span>  out.  Also  they  showed  him  a  cutting</span><span>  taken  from  the  “Queensland  Times,”</span><span>  an  Ipswich  paper,  which  circulates  -  in</span><span>  the  largest  coal  mining  district  in</span><span>  Queensland.  It  reads:  ""Mr.  Thomas,</span><span>  Secretary  of  Colliery  Proprietors’  As</span><span>  sociation,  notified  the  Union,  that  he</span><span>  had  given  instructions  to  the  Consol</span><span>  idated  Company,  to  resume  work,  on</span><span>  pre-stoppage  conditions,  and  dispute</span><span>  would  be  referred  to  the  Court.”  The</span><span>  Manager.then  seemed  to  get  quite  up</span><span>  set,  waving  his  hands  about  he  said,</span><span>  “Run  away  I  won’t  listen  to  any  more,</span><span>  the  mine  will  only  open  on  ray  condi</span><span>  tions,  I  am  not  worrying,  our  custom</span><span>  ers  are  getting  all  the  coal  they  re</span><span>  quire  elsewhere.""  It  will  be  seen  that</span><span>  quire  elsewhere.'’  It  will  be  ,  seen</span><span>  therefore  that  the  management  has</span><span>  adopted  an  arrogant,  aggravating  atti</span><span>  tude  towards  us.  We  are  determined</span><span>  to  resist  such  methods  ns  these  and</span><span>  have  the  backing  of  the  organised</span><span>  workers  both  morally  and  financially</span><span>  throughout  North  Queensland.</span></p> ",Article,1939-08-07,"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR August 5th, 1939.

"<p><span>  OUR  MEMBER.</span></p> <p><span>  ROBES  OF  OFFICE  NOT  NEEDED</span><span>  IN  A  DEMOCRACY.</span></p> <p><span>  Speaking  in  the  Legislative  Assem</span><span>  bly  on  August  31,  our  Member  (Mr.</span><span>  E.  J.  Riordan)  gave  the  following</span><span>  address:</span></p> <p><span></span><span>  ail-.  RIORDAN:  I  wish  to  offer  my</span><span>  congratulations  to  you,  Mr.  Speaker,'</span><span>  on  your  elevation,  to  the  Speakership,</span><span>  l  am  pleased  that  up  to  the  present,  at</span><span>  least,  you  have  discarded  the  robes  of</span><span>  ofllce.  I  have  no  doubt  that  you  will</span><span>  carry  out  the  duties  attaching  to  your</span><span>  position  with  just  ns  much  dignity</span><span>  without  those  loose,  flowing  robes.  As</span><span>  the  lion,  member  for  South  Brisbane</span><span>  said,  when  conducting  you  into  the</span><span>  chair,  it  is  not  the  clothes  that  make</span><span>  the  man.  The  wearing  of  robes  of</span><span>  ofllce  may  be  all  right  in  other  parts</span><span>  of  the  world,  where  pomp  and  dignity</span><span>  must  be  displayed,  but  they  are  alto</span><span>  gether  unnecessary  in  a  democratic</span><span>  country  like  Australia.  If  the  explan</span><span>  ation  of  their  absence  is  not  that  your</span><span>  tailor  is  slow  on  the  job,  I  hope  that</span><span>  you  will  continue  in  your  present  re</span><span>  solve,  and  not  wear  the  robes  that</span><span>  have  been  Worn  by  previous  occupants</span><span>  of  the  chair.  ""</span><span>  I  also  desire  to  congratulate  the</span><span>  mover  and  seconder  of  the  Address  in</span><span>  Reply  on  their  speeches.  The  hon.</span><span>  member  for  Charters  Towers  had  pre</span><span>  vious  experience  in  this  House,  but</span><span>  the  hon  member  for  Townsville  was</span><span>  making  his  debut.  Both  hon.  members</span><span>  made  very  excellent  contributions  to</span><span>  this  debate.  It  is  only  we  members</span><span>  who  have  been  in  this  House  for  but</span><span>  a  short  period  who  can  appreciate  the</span><span>  ordeal  of  making  a  maiden  speech.</span><span>  TRIBUTE  TO  “MOSSY”  HYNES.</span><span>  Since  the  first  session  of  this  Par</span><span>  liament  we  have  lost  three  very  fine</span><span>  members  In  the  late  Mr.  “Mossy”</span><span>  Hynes,  the  hon.  member  for  Towns</span><span>  ville;  the  late  Mr.  W.  J.  .Wellington,</span><span>  the  hon.  member  for.  Charters  Towers;</span><span>  and  the  late  Mr.  G.  Pollock,  the  hon.</span><span>  member  for  Gregory.  As  to  Mr.  Hynes,</span><span>  I  am  sure  that  both  sides  regret  his</span><span>  passing.  He  was  kindly  to  a  fault.  He</span><span>  could  always  see  the  other  fellow’s</span><span>  point  of  view.  I  know  of  no  man  who</span><span>  as  more  capable,  or  who  exercised</span><span>  more,  kindly  instincts  in  discharging</span><span>  •the  onerous  duties  of  his  ofllce.  We</span><span>  ou  this  side  regret  the  passing  of  a</span><span>  great  mate.  When  the  history  of  the</span><span>  Labour  Party  in  this  State  comes  to</span><span>  be  written  we  know  that  his  name  will</span><span>  figure  prominently  in  it.</span><span>  The  late  Mr.  Wellington  was  n  man</span><span>  who  hud  battled  hard  and  successfully</span><span>  for  the  people  whom  he  represented</span><span>  for  such  a  long  period  in  this  Cham</span><span>  ber.  Before  he  entered  Parliament</span><span>  he  was  an  organiser  for  various  local</span><span>  branch  unions.  He  could  always  be</span><span>  relied  on  to  put  forward  the  best  argu</span><span>  ments  in  the  interests  of  those  whom</span><span>  he  represented.  He  was  never  found</span><span>  wanting  in  .  his  duty.  He  was  a  man</span><span>  who  had  been  victimised  for  his.  opin</span><span>  ions  in  days  when  it  was  a  crime  to</span><span>  be  a  Labour  man.</span><span>  The  late  Mr.  Pollock  carried  out  his</span><span>  duties  in.  this  House  with  great  dis</span><span>  tinction  to  himself  and  Parliament.  I</span><span>  regret  very  much  that  certain  people</span><span>  have  seen  fit  when  travelling  through</span><span>  this  State  to  speak  disparagingly  of</span><span>  him  and  to  drag  his  name  in  the  dirt.</span><span>  Of  course,  suck  conduct  is  In  Weep</span><span>  ing  with  the  policy  of  persons  who  are</span><span>  prone  to  besmirch  the  names  of  those</span><span>  who  cannot  defend  themselves.  ..If  the</span><span>  late  Mr.  Pollock  had  been  living  those</span><span>  people  would  have  spoken  favourably</span><span>  of  him,  but  with  their  tongues  in  their</span><span>  cheeks.  I  hesitate  to  allude  to  such  a</span><span>  matter,  but  it  is  very  uncharitable  to</span><span>  see  a  person  attacked  when  it  is  not</span><span>  possible  for  him  to  defend  himself.</span><span>  NEGLECTED  BOWEN.</span><span>  During  the  recess  the  hon.  member</span><span>  for  East  Toowoomba,  who  appears  to</span><span>  he  the  travelling  official  or  unofficial</span><span>  organiser  of  the  Country  Party,  visit</span><span>  ed  various  electorates  in  North</span><span>  Queensland,  including  the  Bowen  elec</span><span>  torate.  The  Bowen  ""Independent""  re</span><span>  ports  the  lion,  member  ns  saying  much</span><span>  about  tile  neglect  of  Bowen  by  past</span><span>  Governments.  He  has  also  repeated</span><span>  that  statement  in  this  House.  He-fur</span><span>  thor  stated  that  Townsville  should</span><span>  never  have  been  chosen  as  a  settle</span><span>  ment.  That  remark  has  also  been  sup</span><span>  ported  by  a  Mr.  Collinson  In  an  ad</span><span>  dress  before  the  Historical  Society.</span><span>  The  hon.  member  for  East  Toowoomba</span><span>  also  said  that  the  Great  Northern</span><span>  Railway  should  never  have  started  at</span><span>  Townsville.  When  he  speaks  on  these</span><span>  matters  he  must  not  forget  that</span><span>  Townsville  was  established  and  the</span><span>  G.N.R.  constructed  from  that  town  by</span><span>  a  political  party  of  the  same  colour</span><span>  as  himself.</span><span>  According  to  a  report  that  appeared</span><span>  in  the  Bowen  paper,  the  hon.  member</span><span>  for  East  Toowoomba  said  that  he  was</span><span>  leaving  by  his  private  rail  conch  at  2</span><span>  o'clock  in  the  morning.  I  am  pleased</span><span>  to  know  that,  country  members  arc</span><span>  able  to  travel  to  their  electorates  in</span><span>  comfort.  The  next  time  I  have  to  visit</span><span>  my  electorate  I  shall'  apply  to‘the'Min</span><span>  ister-for  a  rail  conch,  too.  T  know  the</span><span>  privilege'has  not  been  extended  to  the</span><span>  leader  of  the  Opposition.  It  was  only</span><span>  at  election  time  that  the  hon.  member</span><span>  for  West  Moreton  was  granted  that</span><span>  privilege.  I  do  not  know  of  any.  other</span><span>  occasion  on  which  lie  obtained  that</span><span>  privilege,  but  it  there  were  other  oc</span><span>  casions,  the  fact  wlll  'lehd  support  to</span></p> <p><span></span><span>  the  argument  :  that  nil  country  mem</span><span>  bers  should  receive  the  privilege,  too.</span><span>  If  ""the  Lender  of  the  Opposition  has</span><span>  not  enjoyed  tliiivprlvllege,  he  should</span><span>  make  application  for  it  unless  he  ex</span><span>  pects'  the  hoh;!  member  to  usurp  his</span><span>  position  1  as  leader  of  the  Country  Party</span><span>  and  :!  Leader  of  Opposition.</span><span>  ""FOSSILISED  CITIZENS.”</span><span>  The  hon,  member  for  East  Too</span><span>  woomba  may  well  .be  surprised  that</span><span>  the  Bowen  rawlay  station  had  been</span><span>  shifted  two  miles  out  of  the  town.  I</span><span>  mention  for  the  ,  information  of  the</span><span>  hon.  member  that  the  people  who  en</span><span>  tertained  him  while  he  was  in  Bowen</span><span>  —some  old  and  respected  citizens,  fos</span><span>  silised  members  of  the  Chamber  of</span><span>  Commerce—rare  the  people  who  are  re</span><span>  sponsible  for  the  shifting  of  that  sta</span><span>  tion.  I  have  that  on  the  word  of  the</span><span>  former  Commissioner  for  Railways,</span><span>  the  late  J.  W.  Davidson.  He  told  me</span><span>  that  a  deputation  of  citizens  waited</span><span>  upon  him  and  said  they  thought  it</span><span>  necessary  ,  to  remove  the  station  to  n</span><span>  place  that  would  be  the  most  central</span><span>  part  of  the  town  when  it  developed</span><span>  as  they  thought  It  would.  That  was</span><span>  In  the  days  when  ;wc  had  dreams  of</span><span>  a  North  Queensland  iron  and  steel</span><span>  works  in;  BowenV  1  That  project  could</span><span>  have  been  carried  into  effect  If  the</span><span>  money  had  been  made  available  when</span><span>  It  was  applled  for  by  the  then-  Premier,</span><span>  1  Mr.  B.  G.  Theodore,  and  It  would  now</span><span>  have  been  a  great  1  national  asset  —  es</span><span>  pecially  when  we  cannot  fill  orders  for</span><span>  .iron  and  steel  from  overseas.</span><span>  TIDE’  BOWEN  STEEL  WORKS.</span><span>  Of  course,  .  It  may  be  argued  that</span><span>  this  is  a  time  of  crises,  when  there  is</span><span>  an  abnormal  demand  for  these  pro</span><span>  ducts,  but  it.  would  have  been  a  great</span><span>  asset  at  any  time.  Mr.  Theodore  show</span><span>  ed  great  vision  and  foresight  when  he</span><span>  made  the  suggestion  that  the  Govern</span><span>  ment  borrow  £5,000,000  or  £6,000,000</span><span>  for  the  establishment  of  an  iron  and</span><span>  steel  works  at  Bowen.  Vested  interests</span><span>  made  It  impossible  for  Mr.,  Theodore</span><span>  to  borrow  that  money.  It  may  be  said</span><span>  that  is  past  history,  but  it  is  well</span><span>  worth  repeating  that  if  we  had  an  iron</span><span>  and  steel  works  in  Bowen  today  we</span><span>  should  have  a  population  in  and</span><span>  around  Bowen  of  30,000  or  40,000</span><span>  people.  In  support  of  that  statement</span><span>  I  mention  the  fact  that  the  iron  and</span><span>  steel  works  at  Newcastle  gives  employ</span><span>  ment,  directly  and  Indirectly  to  approx</span><span>  imately,  25,000  people.  Even  if  there</span><span>  had  been  a  loss  during  the  stages  of</span><span>  development—a  loss  that  has  occurred-</span><span>  In  other  industries  till  they  reached</span><span>  a  productive  stage—it  would  now  have</span><span>  been  a  very  profitable  industry.</span><span>  Profits  do  not;  count  for  everything</span><span>  with  me.  After  all  is  said  and  done,</span><span>  it  Is  the  duty  of  every  hon.  member  to</span><span>  do  the  best  he  can,.first  for  Australia</span><span>  and  next  for  QdfSiislahd.  There  is  a</span><span>  great  awakening  Iti  this  State  and  in</span><span>  Australia  to  our  resposibllities  and  the</span><span>  need  for  developing  this  country.  If</span><span>  we-are  going  to  be  hamstrung  by  little</span><span>  Australians  who  have  no  regard  for</span><span>  the  development  of  this  State,  the</span><span>  quicker  we  get  it  over  and  the  quicker</span><span>  democracy  disappears  the  better.  A</span><span>  democracy  can  be  maintained  only  by</span><span>  giving  to  each  and  'every  person  with</span><span>  in  it  the  right  to  work  and  live  decent</span><span>  ly.  If  we  full  to  do-4hls,  we  can  ex</span><span>  pect  other  forms  of  government  to  be</span><span>  substituted.  No  doubt,  hon.  members</span><span>  opposite  regard  my  remarka  as  the  ut</span><span>  terances  of  a  Communist,  but  that  is</span><span>  not  so.  They  are  made  by  nn  Austra</span><span>  lian  with  an  Australian  outlook.</span><span>  DEVELOPMENT  of  state  mine</span><span>  NEEDED;'</span><span>  On  the  proposal  -  to  ,establish  iron</span><span>  works  at  Bowen  the  Bowen  Harbour</span><span>  Board  was  committed  to  the  expendi</span><span>  ture  of  approximately  £200,000  for  the</span><span>  construction  Of  a  new,  wharf  and  coal</span><span>  transporter.  On  the  :  abandonment  of</span><span>  that  proposal.lt  was-left  with  these  on</span><span>  its  hands  and  it  was  then  suggested</span><span>  that,  ns  there  were  large  coal  deposits</span><span>  at  Collinsville,  60  miles  away,  endeav</span><span>  ours  should  be  made  :to  Increase  the</span><span>  export  trade  in  coal.  Yet,  deapite  /  tlie</span><span>  unlimited  supply  of  coal  in  the  neigh</span><span>  bourhood,.  Bowen  is  actually  today  in</span><span>  the  position  of  being  unable  to  fill</span><span>  local  orders.  Owlng  to  lack  of  devel</span><span>  opment  in  the  mines.  If  a  strike  or</span><span>  stoppage  takes  place  ;-in  any  one,  or</span><span>  j  dors  for  coal  go  to  Newcastle,  outside</span><span>  the  State.  ;.The  sooner  ;we'get  down  to</span><span>  bedrock  and  'the  .sooner’  the-Govern</span><span>  ment  set  aside  money'for  the  develop</span><span>  ment.  of  the  mine,  so  that  a  greater</span><span>  number  of  miners  can  .  be  'employed,</span><span>  and  thus  make  it  possible'  to  meet  j</span><span>  emergency  orders,  the;  better  for</span><span>  Queensland.  The  Stage  has  been</span><span>  reached  In  the  Bowen  pren'.at  which</span><span>  no  greater  quantity  of.  coal  cau  bo</span><span>  produced,  owing  to  lack  of  develop</span><span>  ment.</span><span>  MEAT  QUOTA  SHOULD  BE</span><span>  INCREASED.</span><span>  The  commission  on  transport  recom</span><span>  mended  that  £llO,OOO  be  written  off</span><span>  the  debt  of  the  Bowen  Harbour  Board.</span><span>  That  would  relieve  ..the,  ;  Board,  but,</span><span>  unfortunately,  It  is.  making  applica</span><span>  tion  for  a  loan  for-(dredging  and  ex</span><span>  tending  wharves  to  accommodate  the</span><span>  modern  motor,  vessels'that  come  to</span><span>  Queensland  to  -  lift  chilled  and  frozen</span><span>  beef  for  overseas.  The  present</span><span>  wharves  are  Inadequate.  I  have  pre</span><span>  viously  pointed  out  that  there-  is  n</span><span>  saving  of  18  to  20  days  In  the  trans</span><span>  port  of  chilled  beef  overseas  if  boats</span><span>  go  through  the  Torres  Strait.  The</span></p> <p><span>  Unit  consideration  of  tills  State  Parlia</span><span>  ment  should  be  the  development  of</span><span>  Queensland,  and  one  factor  would  be</span><span>  an  increase  in  the  overseas  trade  in</span><span>  chilled  beef.  As  ""part  of  the  British</span><span>  Kmpirc  we  should  be  able  to  retain,  if</span><span>  not  increase,  our  present  quota,  night</span><span>  ly.  there  should  be  an  increase  and</span><span>  not  a  decrease  in  the  quota.</span><span>  Mr.  Muller:  We  are  nut  lining  our</span><span>  quota.</span><span>  Mr.  XtIOIIDAN:  As  the  hon.  inember</span><span>  has  pointed  out,  we  are  not  tilling  our</span><span>  own  quota,  but-an  extension  would</span><span>  mean  greater  wealth  to  the  State  of</span><span>  Queensland,  and  consequently  nddl-'</span><span>  tlonal  employment  and  a  higher  stan</span><span>  dard  of  living  for  our  people.  These</span><span>  are  matters  that  concern  us  as  Queens</span><span>  landers  and  Australians.</span><span>  GRIM  RECOLLECTIONS  OF</span><span>  RELIEF.</span><span>  Without  appearing  to  be  sarcastic</span><span>  and  with  no  desire  to  ridicule  anoth</span><span>  er’s  point  of  view,  X  take  exception  to</span><span>  some  of  the  comments  on  unemploy</span><span>  ment  made  by  Opposition  members  in</span><span>  this  debate..  What  is  the,good  of  go</span><span>  ing  back  Into  the  past?  We  must  look</span><span>  to  the  future  and  see  whether  we  can</span><span>  do  greater  things  for  the  people  who</span><span>  are  in  the  unenviable  position  of  being</span><span>  unemployed  in  this  State.  Each  and</span><span>  every  hon.  member  opposite  who  has</span><span>  spoken  has  said:  ""What  are  you  doing</span><span>  about  the  unemployed?  You  stole</span><span>  £220,000  from  the  people  of  the  State.</span><span>  You  have  made  it  possible  in  that  way</span><span>  to  have  a  surplus  of  £14,000.”  What</span><span>  does  all  that  matter?  That  has  all</span><span>  gone.  Let  us  look  to  the  future  and</span><span>  see  if  we  can  build  up  something  that</span><span>  is  better  for  the  people  who  are  In  the</span><span>  unenviable  position  of  being  without</span><span>  work.</span><span>  I  do  not  want  to  go  back  into  the</span><span>  past,  because  I  have  some  very  grim</span><span>  recollections'  of  it.  1  liave  been  unem</span><span>  ployed'and  on  relief  work.  I  can  re</span><span>  member  the  Introduction  of  the  relief</span><span>  scheme  by  the  Moore  Government.  I</span><span>  suppose  at  that  time  they  thought</span><span>  that  it  was  a  measure  that  would  bet</span><span>  ter  the'  conditions  of  the  people,  who</span><span>  were  receiving  nothing  then.  They</span><span>  proposed  that  a  man  who  had  a  wife</span><span>  and  two  children  should  go  to  work</span><span>  for  two  days  a  week  and  receive  £1</span><span>  for  the  work  he  did.  The  criticism  of</span><span>  hon.  members  opposite  today  and  for</span><span>  the  past  week  has  been  of.the  condi</span><span>  ■  tioiiy  that  now  exist.

"<p><span>  THE  PRESS  BALL</span></p> <p><span>  EXCEEDS  PREVIOUS  SUCCESS.</span></p> <p><span>  The  1939  Press  Ball  took  place  on</span><span>  Friday  night  and  once  again  hit  a  high</span><span>  note  of  enjoyment  for  the  large  at</span><span>  tendance.  Unlike  most  ball  functions,</span></p> <p><span>  </span><span>  there  was  a  full  attendance  early  in</span><span>  the  night,  so  that  before  9  p.m.  the</span><span>  fun  was  under  way.  It  continued  un</span><span>  ceasingly  until  the  small  hours,  with</span><span>  two  orchestras  keeping  the  dancing</span><span>  continuous  and  lively.</span><span>  The  decorating  of  the  hall  was  car</span><span>  ried  out  in  the  black  and  white  colours</span><span>  of  the  press,  and  the  red  and  gold  of</span><span>  the  Ambulance,  a  very  good  effect  be</span><span>  ing  achieved  with  a  myriad  streamers</span><span>  descending  from  the  ceiling,  and  in  a</span><span>  fancy  pattern  on  the  walls.  Vari</span><span>  coloured  balloons  added  to  the  gaiety</span><span>  of  the  scene.  An  unusual  feature,  was</span><span>  the  great  sign  suspended  over  the</span><span>  stage,  which  proclaimed  in  large  glit</span><span>  tering  silver  letters  Unit  this  was  the</span><span>  ‘Press  Ball  1939.”</span><span>  The  lavish  distribution  of  novelties</span><span>  at  frequent  intervals,  dancing  competi</span><span>  tions,  and  the-new-crazy  dances  kept</span><span>  everyone  in  very  good  mood  through</span><span>  out,  and  several  twilight  waltzs  were</span><span>  very  popular.  Interest  was  keen  in</span><span>  the  Old  Time  Waltz  competition,  as</span><span>  the  contestants  in  that  graceful  dance</span><span>  were  thinned  down  to  the  winners,  Mr.</span><span>  George  Weekes  and  Miss  Pat  Conser</span><span>  dyne,  who  well  deserved  the  prize.</span><span>  The  judges  found  the  decision  hard</span><span>  to  arrive  at  in  the  Foxtrot  Competi</span><span>  tion,  and  finally  awarded  a  tie  to  Mr.</span><span>  and  Mrs.  T.  Donohue  and  Mr.  Forder</span><span>  add  .  Miss  .less  Cordes,  both  couples</span><span>  dancing  extremely  well  before,  an  ad</span><span>  miring  crowd.</span><span>  The  Crazy  Dances:  which  have  swept</span><span>  the  world  have  found  many  devotees</span><span>  in  Bowen,  and  this  was  the  first  ball</span><span>  at  which  they  were  all  featured.  The</span><span>  star  item  was  the  Most  Humorous</span><span>  Lambeth  Walk,  and  everybody  joined</span><span>  in  what  was  the  most  laughable  Lam</span><span>  beth  Walk  ever  staged  locally.  Knees</span><span>  were  slapped  harder,  and  the  “Oi’s”</span><span>  rose  louder  than  ever.  The  prize</span><span>  went  to  the  pianortiming  and  wise</span><span>  cracking  Mr.  Bill  Cullum  and  his  part</span><span>  ner  Miss  Kath.  Burns.  Their’s  was</span><span>  an  epic  effort.</span><span>  The  strains  of  “Neath  the  Spreading</span><span>  Chestnut  Tree”  brought  the  crowd  to</span><span>  their  feet  for  this  new  dance,  and  they</span><span>  loved  it.  This  action  song  about  the</span><span>  goings-on  under  a  certain  chestnut</span><span>  tree  gained  a  permanent  place  in  our</span><span>  dance  programmes.  Another  new  but</span><span>  not  quite,  so  crazy  dance  in  the  Palais</span><span>  Glide  was  next  introduced,  and  proved</span><span>  just  as  popular.</span><span>  Interest  was  very  keen  in  the  Swell</span><span>  of  the  Ball  Competition,  and  canvass</span><span>  ing  for  votes  for  Lost  principal</span><span>  candidates  went  on  until  the  voting</span><span>  closed.  The  wlpne£prOyed  to-be  .Kick</span><span>  (“Siiiicho”)  Woods,  5  the  jfiivojirite,  who</span><span>  netted  88  votes,  with  the  runner-up  a</span><span>  Merinda  candidatei’in  Mcrvyn  Perkins,</span><span>  who,gained  78  votes;'Third  place  went</span><span>  to  Glen  (“Buster"")  Horan  with  51.</span><span>  Mr.  Woods,  his  face  matching  his  hair</span><span>  in  colour,  was  taken  protesting!}'  to</span><span>  tiie  stage  to  be  decorated  with  a  pale</span><span>  blue  sash,  'suitably  inscribed,  and  a</span><span>  silver  loving  cup.

The  supper',  room  was  tastefully</span><span>  decorated  in  the  Ambulance  colours,  a</span><span>  tribute  to  tiie  lady  workers  responsible</span><span>  for  the  dainties,  and  to  the  efficient</span><span>  humanitarian  organisation  in  whoso</span><span>  aid  the  Ball,  was  devoted.</span><span>  With  the  coming  of  midnight  there</span><span>  was  a  continuous  demand  “Where  is</span><span>  Ihe  “Nightie”  -  '  and’when  that  scandal</span><span>  sheet  did  arrive  there.was  a  stampede</span><span>  to  obtain  copies.  Everyone.  had  con</span><span>  tributed  to  its  spicy  'columns,  each</span><span>  person  at  the  ball  having  been  given</span><span>  a  card  on  which  a  Vieht  par  was  to  he</span><span>  written  about  best  friends—the  kind</span><span>  of  thing  your  best,  friend  usually  does</span><span>  not  tell  you.
