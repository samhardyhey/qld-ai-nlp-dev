On  Monday,  3rd  inst.,  about</span><span>  7  o’clock,  before  leaving  for  my  farm,</span><span>  I  asked  my  wife  to  telephone  to  Mr</span><span>  'Massy  (Secretary)  about  10  o’clock</span><span>  and  advise  him  that  I  would  be  at</span><span>  the  office  to  sign  any  cheques  and</span><span>  arrange  any  necessary  business  at</span><span>  4  o’clock  that  day.

After  I  had  sent  a  consign</span><span>  ment  away  I  left  for  that  place  by</span><span>  horseback  at  3  o’clock  on  Friday.</span><span>  Before  going  I  sent  a  letter  to  the</span><span>  Secretary,  advising  him  it  would  be</span><span>  necessary  to  postpone  the  meeting,</span><span>  also  sent  word  to  both  Vice-Presi</span><span>  dqnts  to  that  effect.  I  knew  the</span><span>  Q.F.I.T.  meeting  was  being  held  oh</span><span>  the  Bth  also.  The  letter  to  the</span><span>  Secretary  was  missorted  into  an</span><span>  other  box,  and  not  handed  in  until</span><span>  the  following  day,  Saturday,  at  12</span><span>  o’clock.  I  have  been  told  by  a</span><span>  member  that  one  -'  Vice-President</span><span>  telephoned  my  request  to  the  Secre</span><span>  tary  to  postpone  the  meeting.  .

It  was</span><span>  not  intended  to  admit  other</span><span>  than  members  of  the  Associa</span><span>  tion  but  they  gradually  drifted</span><span>  ip  until  there  was  a  fair  num</span><span>  ber  of  non-members  present,</span><span>  including  many  Labour  ,  sup</span><span>  porters,  some  of.  whom  occas</span><span>  ionally  fired  a  shot  at  the</span><span>  speaker,  who  handled  inter-/</span><span>  jectors  cleverly.

Even</span><span>  tually  Mr  Kent,  after  an  ap-  •</span><span>  peal  for  fair  play  had  been</span><span>  made,  managed  to  say  a  few,</span><span>  words  but  was  unable  to  pro</span><span>  perly  explain  mattersowing  to</span><span>  the  continued  interruptions  of</span><span>  prominent  members  and  the</span><span>  meeting  broke  up  in  disorder.</span><span>  Mr  Kent  claims  that  Mr</span><span>  Mann’s  nomination  was  not  in</span><span>  order  and  threatens,  if  he  is</span><span>  not  given  a  fair  hearing  to</span><span>  come  out  as  an  independent</span><span>  candidate.

Mr</span><span>  Kent,  when  Chairman  of  the  Asso</span><span>  ciation,  became  a  candidate  in  the</span><span>  recent  local  plebiscite,  and  was  de</span><span>  feated  by  Mr  John  Mann.  When</span><span>  the  Chairman  of  a  Local  Authority</span><span>  becomes  a  candidate  for  a  seat  bn</span><span>  the  Local  Authority  concered,  he</span><span>  ceases  to  hold  office  as  Chairman.</span><span>  When  a  Chairman  of  an  Association</span><span>  such  as  the  Bowen  Producers  and</span><span>  National  Political  Association  be</span><span>  comes  a  candidate  for  a  plebiscite,</span><span>  it  is  usual  for  the  Chairman  to  cease</span><span>  to  hold  office  as  Chairman.  Long</span><span>  useage  is  a  law  sufficient.  By  corn</span><span>  mom  usage,  then,  Mr  Kent  should</span><span>  have  ceased  to  hold  office  as  Chair</span><span>  man,  but  he  has  not  yet  had  the  or</span><span>  dinary  common  decency  to  resign</span><span>  the  position.  From  the  time  he  ;</span><span>  became  a  candidate  in  the  recent</span><span>  plebiscite,  any  business  transacted</span><span>  by  him  as  Chairman  was  illegal:</span><span>  Of  how  much  value  then,  was  the</span><span>  advertisement  referred  to  as  having  ;</span><span>  been  inserted  by  him,  other  than</span><span>  the  amount  of  excitement  and</span><span>  amusement  afforded  to  the  members</span><span>  of  the.  Association,  at  his  expense</span><span>  and  to  the  detriment  of  }he  objects</span><span>  of  an  Association,  of  which  he</span><span>  claims  to  be  the  father  (a  bad  fath-;</span><span>  er  surely).  Mr  Kent  misconstrues</span><span>  the  reading  of  Rule  8  to  suit  his</span><span>  own  ends  and  disregards  his  Solici</span><span>  tor’s  correct  interpretation  of  the</span><span>  the  same,  which,  in  effect,  is</span><span>  (hat  '  the  Secretary  shall  convene</span><span>  meetings,  He  had  no  justification</span><span>  for  attempting  to  use  Mr  Mann’s</span><span>  meeting  as  a  means  to  give  vent  to</span><span>  his  own  miserable  feelings  of  jeal</span><span>  ousy.  or  a  place  at  which  to  ad</span><span>  versely  criticise  Mr  Mann’s  candid</span><span>  ature  for  the  forthcoming  general</span><span>  plebiscite.  He  claimed  the  right  to</span><span>  preside  at  the  meeting  and  disgrace</span><span>  fully  prostituted  the  position.  The</span><span>  aftermath,  in  the  street,  in-so-far-as</span><span>  Mr  Kent  was  concerned,  was  de</span><span>  plorable,  so  much  that  a  limb  of  the</span><span>  la\y  gave  him  paternal  advice.  He</span><span>  claims’  that  Mt  Mann’s  nomination,</span><span>  is  not  in  order,  but  has  not  yet</span><span>  thought  fit  to  refer  the  matter  to</span><span>  the  Association’s  .Executive  for</span><span>  remedy.

"<p><span>  MR.  KENT’S  MEETING.</span></p> <p><span></span><span>  A  fairly  large  and  representa</span><span>  tive  audience  attended  a  pub</span><span>  lic  meeting  called  by  Mr  GK</span><span>  E.  Keht  on  Thursday  last,  in</span></p> <p><span></span><span>  the  School;  of  Arts;  Several</span><span>  ladies  being  in  the  audience,</span><span>  no  ddubti  haclk  soothing  effect,</span><span>  as  the  general  expectation  was</span><span>  that  the  meeting  would  be  of</span><span>  a  very  lively  nature.</span><span>  His  Worship  the  Mayor  who</span><span>  occupied  the  Chair,  briefly  in</span><span>  troduced.  Mr  Kent  to  the.</span><span>  meeting  .and  asked  the  add*</span><span>  ience  for  a  fair  hearing.</span><span>  ■Mr-Kent  said  lie  was  there</span><span>  to  .try  and  place  the  -  present</span><span>  political  upheaval  clearly  be</span><span>  fore  the  .audience,.  The  'far</span><span>  mers  position  today  whs  de</span><span>  plorable,  shipments  had  been</span><span>  sent  down  by'  boats,  and  had</span><span>  been  reshipped  and  'delayed.!  n</span><span>  transit  until  finally  they  reach</span><span>  edcport'Xin  anjjklnaQstr,  useless</span><span>  condition.  The  ■  loss  to  the</span><span>  Bowen  producer  was  rapidly</span><span>  accumulating.  The  reason</span><span>  being  that  Labour  and  capital</span><span>  were  at  daggers  drawn  and  be</span><span>  tween  them  they  were  pulling</span><span>  the  unfortunate  producer  to</span><span>  pieces.  In  his  opinion  Mr</span><span>  Swayne  was  the  only  real  pro</span><span>  ducers  representative  in  the</span><span>  parliament.  The  only  remedy</span><span>  $OlB  ip  t-j  return  -men  who  had</span><span>  the  confidence  of  both  labour</span><span>  and  capital.  Bowen  growers</span><span>  were  ,  losing  out  £lO,OOO  a</span><span>  month.  And  tbej  r  farmers</span><span>  were  the.  men  who  had  made</span><span>  Bowen.  He  wasn’t  there  to</span><span>  judge  tbe,x  Unions  ;  but  he</span><span>  thought  that  both  they  and</span><span>  the  shipping  companies  were</span><span>  going  too  far.  Mr  Mann  had</span><span>  said  in  the  BoVen  speech</span><span>  “produce,  produce,  produce,”</span><span>  but  what  was  the  use-  of</span><span>  producing  w  hen  ■-  th  e  i  r</span><span>  Seduce  was  allowed  to  rot,</span><span>  e  (Mr  Mann)  lyad  said  could</span><span>  a  man  be  b  lame  d;  for  chan  gin  g</span><span>  bis  politics.’’  Mr  Kent  said</span><span>  a'farnM’;  be  blathed  for</span><span>  getting,  a  ;  -  new  plough  dr  a</span><span>  new  man  ?  Mr  Long  (Jnr.)</span><span>  had  said  -  at  a  meeting</span><span>  that  there  was  nothing  new  in</span><span>  Bowen,  but.  the  farmers  would</span><span>  show,  that  there  was.  The</span><span>  producer.'  was  the  only  man</span><span>  who  could  end  the  strike.  He</span><span>  had  grown;  as  many  as  89C</span><span>  eases  in  one  week  in  Bowen.</span><span>  Did  the  lumpers  need  those</span><span>  cases  ?  Did  the  shipping  com</span><span>  panies  want  the  m  ?  He</span><span>  was  one  of  the  b  i  g  g  e  st</span><span>  producers  in  Bowen  and  for</span><span>  the  last  1  seventeen  years</span><span>  had  ■  never  ''  looked,  back.</span><span>  Had  he  no  right  to  come  and</span><span>  £peak  to  them  as  a  producer  ?</span><span>  Personally  he  was  independent</span><span>  of  anyone  but  he  asked  for  the</span><span>  sympathy  of  the  audience  for</span><span>  the  small  farmer,  the  man  who</span><span>  was  being  ruined  to-day.  It</span><span>  j  had  been  said  that  the  labour</span><span>  [party  were  following  their</span><span>  passions  -rather  than  their,</span><span>  brains.  Hadn’t  the  same</span><span>  thing  been  seen  here  in  Bowen  p</span><span>  At  the.last  National  Producers’</span><span>  Association  meeting  the  man</span><span>  who'  had  at  the  previous  meet</span><span>  ing  tabled  a  motion  asking</span><span>  him'  .(Mr  Kent)""  to  resign—-and</span><span>  who'  was  a'  cti  ng.  eh  air  man</span><span>  had;  fled,  from  the,  room  before</span><span>  he  had  time  to  move  it!  The</span><span>  speaker  referred  at  length  to  a</span><span>  speech  made  by  Mr  Willis</span><span>  which  appeared  in  the  “Towns-'</span><span>  ville  Bulletin”  which  he.  ad</span><span>  vised,  alhpresent  to  read.  5  He</span><span>  also  referred  to  different  union</span><span>  communities'  who  had  tried</span><span>  farming  on  co-operative  lines  in</span><span>  certain  centres  such  as  Bar</span><span>  ealdine.  Unfortunately  the</span><span>  good-men  had  had  to  carry  the</span><span>  wasters  on  their  back  and  the</span><span>  idea,  had-failed.  We  were  not</span><span>  all  built-on  one  pattern,  brains</span><span>  must  win  in  the  end,  but  we</span><span>  wanted  justice.-  True  demo</span><span>  cracy  must  win.  The  labour</span><span>  unions’  desire  to  control  the</span><span>  industrieswf  the  country  must</span><span>  lead  to  industrial  upheaval.</span><span>  Tens  of  thousands  of  union</span><span>  men  were  beginning  to  realise</span><span>  that  the'  good  men  were  carry</span><span>  ing  tbe  slacker  on  their  back.</span><span>  That  was  true  here  in  Bowen</span><span>  too.  The  ...  cultivation  '  was</span><span>  being  keph  down.  He  said  he</span><span>  had  started  for  6/-  a  week'and</span><span>  now  he  was  paying  any  of  his</span><span>  men  more  than  that  a  day.</span><span>  He  again  advised  all  his  hear</span><span>  ers  to  read  Mr  Willis’  speech.</span><span>  Look  at  the  industrial  upheave</span><span>  al-to-day.  ■  The  labour  party</span><span>  had  got  into  power  and  we  see  I</span><span>  them  making  into  all  sbrts  of</span></p> <p><span></span><span>  expenditure.  We  see  another</span><span>  £23,000  put  to  credit  of  Bowen</span><span>  railway—another  sop  to  keep</span><span>  us  quiet—the  Labour  govern</span><span>  ment  had  got  drunk  with:suc</span><span>  cess.  What  would  do</span><span>  i£  he  got  a  cheque  of  £l,OOO  ?</span><span>  (Laughter).  He’d  say  “come</span><span>  on  boys,  we’ll  have  a  glorious</span><span>  bust  up”,  and  they  would'  all</span><span>  go  on  a  bender  ;*  it  was  the</span><span>  same  with  the  labour  party</span><span>  but  there  would  be  a  to-mor</span><span>  row.  The  question  might  be</span><span>  asked  why  had  he  come  out  in</span><span>  to  politics  H  It  whs  because</span><span>  he  wanted  to  better  the  posi</span><span>  tion  of  tbe  struggling  farmer.</span><span>  (Laughter)  They</span><span>  might  laugh  but  he  was  the</span><span>  1  man  Avho'hadistarted-the  farm</span><span>  ers  umbh  here.  He  still  held</span><span>  the  position  of  chairman  of</span><span>  and  Nat*</span><span>  'donal;Eol>tiGali;Associatioh;  in</span><span>  spite  of  Mr  Massy.  He  had</span><span>  ;been;asked  to  -  sign  a  paper</span><span>  once  by  Mr  Anderson,  as  Mr</span><span>  [  Bide  had  said  he  (Mi*  Kent)</span><span>  W.ould.sigu,anything.  But  did</span><span>  lili  ?  Akk  Mr  MUSsy  if  he</span><span>  would  sign  .the  :  paper  he  (Mr-</span><span>  Massyj  wanted  him  to.  (laugh</span><span>  ter.)  If  he  :  got  justice'  he</span><span>  might  sign  that  paper  but  not</span><span>  otherwise.  He  was  ah  inde</span><span>  pendent  man  and  didh’t  care  a</span><span>  snap  of  the  fingers</span><span>  fp  r  anyone.  M  r  Ken  t</span><span>  then  went  back  a  few  years</span><span>  and  ifiehtrdned  thingsi  that  be  1</span><span>  had  done  one  gentlemen  in</span><span>  ;  thb  hhHiehhei  felling;  fiimi""  that</span><span>  if  he  continued-to  refer  to  his</span><span>  private  affairs  from  a.  public</span><span>  platform  he  would  -kidfe-  I  liiith’</span><span>  off  it,  Mr  Kent  said  he  only</span><span>  ihstauced</span><span>  show  that  he  was  a  good  towns</span><span>  man.  'He  was  a  nationalist</span><span>  and  wanted  to  see  the  town</span><span>  ‘prosper;  He  would  like  !  to  re</span><span>  fer  to  one  lie  .that  had  been</span><span>  circulated.  He  had  been  ac</span><span>  cused  of  putting  Mr  T.  Reed’s</span><span>  wife  name:on  the  roll,  but  the</span><span>  Mrs  Reid  that  he  had  put  on</span><span>  was  a  tenant  of  his  and  her</span><span>  initial  was  the  same.  The  old!</span><span>  days  of  politics  had  gone  and</span><span>  a  man  now  should  vote  for  the</span><span>  one  he  thought  best  for  the</span><span>  town.  He  wished  to  say  that</span><span>  if  Mr  Mann  stood  for  Bowen</span><span>  that  he  would  vote  for  Mr  Col</span><span>  lins.  He  endorsed  the  plat</span><span>  form  of  the  Tamers’  Union.</span><span>  The  people  of  Bowen,  needed</span><span>  ships  to,  carry  their  produce.</span><span>  No  man  in  Bowen  to-day</span><span>  could  say  when  the  next  boat</span><span>  would  call  in-tp  carry  produce,</span><span>  south.  The  producer  wanted</span><span>  the  registration  of  agents  ;  he</span><span>  instanced  a  case  where  his  own</span><span>  tomatoes  had  been.sold  for  2/6</span><span>  and.tlien  resold  for  6/6;  where</span><span>  did  he  come  in  ?  He  congrat</span><span>  ulated  the  present  government</span><span>  on  trying  to  bring  put  the</span><span>  Producers  1  Act..  It  showed</span><span>  they  had  some  heart  for  the</span><span>  farmer.  But  the  Labour  Govr</span><span>  ernment’s  first  consideration</span><span>  was  for  the  unions,  -who  had</span><span>  put  them  into  power,  and  after</span><span>  that  the  farmer.  His;  sym</span><span>  pathy  was  with  neither  the</span><span>  union  or  the  shippihg  compan</span><span>  ies  but  with  the  farmer.,  The</span><span>  farmer  was  doing  his  Lit  for</span><span>  the  man  at  the  firdrit  by</span><span>  iug  him  and  he  thoughtithat</span><span>  the  farmer  was  th'e  last  naan</span><span>  who  should  go.</span><span>  The  'chairman  then  called</span><span>  for  questions  and  none  being</span><span>  forthcoming  he  thanked  ;the</span><span>  audience  for  the  very  patient</span><span>  way  they  had  listened  to  Mr</span><span>  Kent  and  asked  the  audience</span><span>  to  show  their  appreciation  in</span><span>  the  usual  way,  which  they  did.</span><span>  Mr  Kent  thanked  the  aud</span><span>  ience  for  the  manner  in  which</span><span>  they  had  listened  to  him  and</span><span>  also  for  their  applause  and</span><span>  called  for  the',  usual  vote  of</span><span>  thanks  to  the  chair.</span></p> <p><span>  s  who'  was  touringi</span><span>  'through  the  country  in  a  motor-oari</span><span>  saw,  walking  ahead  of  him,  a  man!</span><span>  followed  by  a  dog.
