"<p><span>  SUNRISE  ROAD  LOAN.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Editor,  'Nambour  Chronicle.'</span></p> <p><span>  Sir,  —  In  further  -and  final  reply  to</span><span>  Mr.  Lanharn,  I  would  point  out  that</span><span>  had  the.  'old  woman.'  :?-  hi  terms</span><span>  himself,  given  full  f;tc!s  .;ml  not-  try  I</span><span>  lo  mislead  the  public,  I  should  not</span><span>  have  thought  it  my  duty  to  wake  hin.</span><span>  up.  He  ha.s  evidently  been  asleep</span><span>  again,  to  wake  up  and  find  out  the</span></p> <p><span>  Council  wanted  to  borrow  £1,000  for</span><span>  the  Sunrise  Road.  It  is  over  two</span><span>  years  since  the  Council  first  moved  in</span><span>  this  matter,  and  this  is  the  second</span><span>  time  they  advertised  the-  fact  of  their</span><span>  intention  to  borrow.  Is  it  any  won</span><span>  der  they  are  short  of  money?  By</span><span>  their  bungling  business  methods  we</span><span>  are  going  to  be  the  losers  of  a  little</span><span>  less  than  £1,000  expenditure  on  this</span><span>  road,  owing  to  the  changed  conditions,</span><span>  and  the  wet  season  will  no  doubt  take</span><span>  its  toll  also.  Had  this  roa'd  been  for</span><span>  the  direct  benefit  and  convenience  of</span><span>  No.  2  Division  I  venture  to  say  it</span><span>  would  have  been  completed  18  months</span><span>  or  two  years  ago!  And  they  would</span><span>  want  us  to  help  to  pay  for  it,  like  the</span><span>  Montville  people  are  paying  for  t.'ie</span><span>  Maroochydore  Road.  We  will  be</span><span>  happy  to  pay  for  this  Sunrise  Road,</span><span>  and  pleased  to  see  Nambour  motorists</span><span>  using  it,  to  go  to  the  iinest  seaside</span><span>  resort,  on  the  North  Coast.  Mr.  Lan</span><span>  ham  considers  I  am  ignorant  when  I</span><span>  say  the  Town  Hall,  electric  light,</span><span>  Maplclon  tramway,  Buderim  tramway,</span><span>  Coolurn  road.  Gawthorn's  bridge,  Yan</span><span>  dlna  bridge  and  road  (he  forget  the</span><span>  Maroochydore  road)  are  No.  'I  conveni</span><span>  ences.  I  leave  it  to  your  readers'  in</span><span>  telligence  to  judge  for  themselves,</span><span>  epecially  when  they  know  it  is  onlv  a</span><span>  matter  of  time,  when  they  will  ask  No.</span><span>  1  Division  to  help  to  pay  for  them.  1</span><span>  did  not  ask  him  to  start  the  corres</span><span>  pondence,  but  when  he  docs  he  must</span><span>  take  what  is  coming  to  him.  Readers</span><span>  will  note  how  iie  overlooked  the  full</span><span>  facts  and  questions  I  asked  him  in  my</span><span>  last  letter,  or  did  he  consider  lie  had</span><span>  burnt  his  fingers.  I  am  prepared  to</span><span>  take  his  word  that  his  rates  ur  paid</span><span>  to  December  31.  1932;  readers  cm  do</span><span>  so  also  if  they  wish.  In  my  opinion</span><span>  Mr.  Lanhum's  figures  arc  no  more-  re</span><span>  liable  than  those  over  the  signature</span><span>  oC  'Finance'  in  your  last  issue,  when</span><span>  In-  says  ponem!  rales  levied  for  No.  2</span><span>  £1.71*;  rates  received  January  to  Oc</span><span>  tober  £3,5  i5.

This  season  the</span><span>  Country  Advisory  Board  of  tiie  Q.CA.</span><span>  was  out  to  secure  a  larger  number  of</span><span>  players  from  the.  country  associations</span><span>  for  Country  Wee.k.  Country  cricketers</span><span>  had  a  chance  to  get.  into  these  competi</span><span>  tions,  and  from  which  selection  was</span><span>  possible  for  interstate  honours.  It</span><span>  was  fully  recognised  that  the  Q.CA.</span><span>  'inni  '  ttr  look  more  lo  the  country  for</span><span>  their  future  players  in  big  cricket.</span><span>  The  experience  gained  by  tiiose  so</span><span>  chosen  was  helpful,  and  that  experi</span><span>  ence  could  bc-taken  back  to  their  asso</span><span>  ciations.  Players  had  therefore  a</span><span>  ehance  to  work  Iheir  way  into  inter</span><span>  state  teams  as  well  as  into  Test  cricket</span><span>  The  'spade'  work  had  already  com</span><span>  menced  for  this  season.  The  Q.CA.</span><span>  was  planning  to  bring  36  players  to</span><span>  Brisbane  for  Country  Week  this  sea</span><span>  .son,  as  against  2-5  the  previous  f.aason.</span><span>  By  a  small  margin  the  players  from</span><span>  Ibis  association  were  unsuccessful  in</span><span>  getting  into  Country  Week  las!-  year.</span><span>  For  a  team  on  tour  this  year  the  Q.CA.</span><span>  had  allocated  £100.  In  legard  to  ;he</span><span>  grant,  Mr.  Allen  said  that  £300  hart</span><span>  been  made  available  to  thirteen  asso</span><span>  ciations,  and  that  grant  was  ear</span><span>  marked  for  ground  improvements.  He</span><span>  hoped  that  tiie  association  would  give</span><span>  earnest  consideration  to  Ihe  provision</span><span>  of  turf  wickets,  so  that  players  from</span><span>  the  country  would  not  be  at  a  dis</span><span>  advantage  when  they  came  on  lo  wic1</span><span>  kefs  in  Ihe  city.  Turf  wickets  were</span><span>  essential,  and  the  playing  areas  as  far</span><span>  as  possible  should  be  placed  in  first</span><span>  class  condition.  A  move  In  the  direc</span><span>  tion  of  turf  wickets  would  be  appre</span><span>  ciated  not.  only  by  the  players,  but  also</span><span>  by  headimarters  in  Brisbane.

She  remembered</span><span>  the  daily  dose  of  Kruschen  which</span><span>  she  had  taken  for  many  years.  And</span><span>  she  knew  that  one  of  the  things  that</span><span>  Kruschen  did  with  absolute  thorough</span><span>  ness  was  to  keep  the  blood-stream</span><span>  free  from  impurities.  She  wrote</span><span>  this  soon  after  her  return  home  :  —</span><span>  '  I  a™  an  old  woman  over  71.  I</span><span>  have  taken  Kruschqn  Salts  for  a</span><span>  number  of  years,  and  find  they  keep</span><span>  me  fit  and  well.  I  had  operations</span><span>  last  May  for  tonsilitis  and  appendi</span><span>  citis.  I  was  only  away  a  fortnight</span><span>  and  two  days  —  which  is  a  very  quick</span><span>  recovery  for  an  old  woman,  I  reckon.</span><span>  Clean  blood  was  the  reason  for  it,</span><span>  they  told  me,  and  I  give  Kruschen</span><span>  Salts  the  credit  for  that.  I  recom</span><span>  mend  them  wherever  I  go.'  —  E.  R.</span><span>  The  six  salts  in  Kruschen  persuade</span><span>  the  organs  of  elimination  —  liver,</span><span>  kidneys  and  bowels  —  to  function  as</span><span>  they  should  —  often  for  the  first  tune</span><span>  in  then?  lives.  Instead  of  being</span><span>  clogged,  the  intestines  are  clean  and</span></p> <p><span>  clear.  Instead  of  liver  and  kidneys</span><span>  being  sluggish,  they  are  active  and</span><span>  efficient.  New,  healthy  blood  goes</span><span>  coursing  through  the  veins  —  carry-</span><span>  ing  health  and  strength  and  energy</span><span>  to  every  part  of  the  body.</span><span>  And  Kruschen's  gentle  but  positive</span><span>  action  is  more  than  merely  purify</span><span>  ing  —  it  has  a  direct  tonic  effect  upon</span><span>  your  blood,  too,  and  through  your</span><span>  blood-stream  upon  every  fibre  of  your</span><span>  body  —  fills  you  with  a  bracing  sense</span><span>  of  energetic  fitness.  A  refreshed  '</span><span>  and  invigorated  blood-stream  will</span><span>  pull  you  up  to  a  health  level  where</span><span>  you  can  laugh  at  the  idea  of  head</span><span>  aches,  lassitude,  depression  and  the</span><span>  6core  of  minor  ailments  that  keep</span><span>  so  many  people  below  par.

H.  Macy  and  Co.,  in  his  book,  'The  Road^to  Good  |</span><span>  Advertising.  Mr.  Collins  calls  the  newspaper,  'The  one</span><span>  dominant  advertising  medium.  It  has  always  been  the</span><span>  best  advertising  medium  we  can  possibly  employ.  It</span><span>  will  continue  to  be  for  a  long  time.  I  am  constantly  being</span><span>  attacked  by  direct-mail  advertisers  and  others  for  this</span><span>  point  of  view.  If  I  am  wrong,  then  nearly  every  other</span><span>  store  in  America  is  wrong,  with  hardly  an  exception,  ;</span><span>  they  all  spend  by  far  the  greatest  portion  of  their</span><span>  advertising  money  in  the  newspaper.  And  a  quarter  of  a</span><span>  million  merchants  in  the  United  States  can't  be  wrong.'</span><span>  The  right  kind  of  advertising,  Mr.  Collins  writes,</span><span>  could  end  the  hoarding  that  is  held  responsible  for  the</span><span>  continued  slump.</span><span>  'On  the  one  hand,  as  I  have  said,  we  have  an  over</span><span>  abundance  of  goods.  On  the  other  hand  we  have  a</span><span>  massive  reservoir  of  inactive  consumer  purchasing-  ;</span><span>  ability  in  our  banks.  Between  the  two  lies  a  frame  of</span><span>  mind.  That  frame  of  mind  is,  without  qualification,  ;</span><span>  advertising's  responsibility.  Advertising  could  easily</span><span>  change  that  frame  of  mind,  but  we  who  write  advertising</span><span>  have  written  the  wrong  kind.  We  have  fallen  down  on</span><span>  the  job.  We  have.  failed  both  to  understand  that  frame</span><span>  of  mind  as  it  exists  and  we  have  failed  to  direct  it  into</span><span>  a  buying  mood.</span><span>  'It  is  a  blunder  to  allow  newspaper  and  magazine</span><span>  advertising  lineage  to  materially  decrease  as  pessimism</span><span>  mounts.  If  we  subscribe  to  the  thesis  that  buying  is</span><span>  essential  at  this  time,  then  this  is  decidedly  not  the  time</span><span>  to  curtail  our  promotional  activities.  The  stores  that</span><span>  have  continued  the  intelligent,  sound,  aggressive  adver</span><span>  tising  campaigns  have  fared  better  of  late  than  those</span><span>  stores  which  have  curtailed  too  rigidly.  If  we  budget</span><span>  ourselves  to  a  considerable  reduction  in  sales,'  he  adds,</span><span>  'we  can  always  accomplish  our  end.

H.  Macy  and  Co.,  in  his  book,  'The  Road  to  Good</span><span>  Advertising.  Mr.  Collins  calls  the  newspaper,  'The  one</span><span>  dominant  advertising  medium.  It  has  always  been  the</span><span>  best  advertising  medium  we  can  possibly  employ.  It</span><span>  will  continue  to  be  for  a  long  time.  I  am  constantly  being</span><span>  ?  attacked  by  direct-mail  advertisers  and  others  for  this</span><span>  point  of  view.  If  I  am  wrong,  then  nearly  every  other</span><span>  store  in  America  is  wrong.  With  hardly  an  exception,</span><span>  they  all  spend  by  far-  the  greatest  portion  of  their</span><span>  advertising  money  in  the  newspaper.  And  a  quarter  of  a</span><span>  million  merchants  in  the  United  States  can't  be  wrong.'</span><span>  The  right  kind  of  advertising,  Mr.  Collins  writes,</span><span>  could  end  the  hoarding  that  is  held  responsible  for  the</span><span>  continued  slump.</span><span>  'On  the  one  hand,  as  I  have  said,  we  have  an  over</span><span>  abundance  of  goods.  On  the  other  hand  we  have  a</span><span>  massive  reservoir  of  inactive  consumer  purchasing</span><span>  ability  in  our  banks.  Between  the  two  lies  a  frame  of</span><span>  mind.  That  frame  of  mind  is,  without  qualification,</span><span>  advertising's  responsibility.  Advertising  could  easily</span><span>  change  that  frame  of  mind,  but  we  who  write  advertising</span><span>  have  written  the  wrong  kind.  We  have  fallen  down  on</span><span>  the  job.  We  have  failed  both  to  understand  that  frame</span><span>  of  mind  as  it  exists  and  we  have  failed  io  direct  it  into</span><span>  a  buying  mood.</span><span>  'It  is  a  blunder  to  allow  newspaper  and  magazine</span><span>  advertising  lineage-  to  materially  decrease  as  pessimism</span><span>  mounts.  If  we  subscribe  to  the  thesis  that  buying  is</span><span>  P  ?  essential  at  this  time,  then  this  is  decidedly  not  the  time</span><span>  to  curtail  our  promotional  activities.  The  stores  that</span><span>  have  continued  the  intelligent,  sound,  aggressive  adver</span><span>  tising  campaigns  have  fared  better  of  late  than  those</span><span>  stores  which  have  curtailed  too  rigidly.  If  we  budget</span><span>  ourselves  to  a  considerable  reduction  in  sales,'  he  adds,</span><span>  'we  can  always  accomplish  our  end.

H.  Macy  and  Co.,  in  his  book,  'The  Road  to  Good</span><span>  Advertising.  Mr.  Collins  calls  the  newspaper,  'The  one</span><span>  dominant  advertising  medium.  It  has  always  been  the</span><span>  best  advertising  medium  we  can  possibly  employ.  It</span><span>  will  continue  to  be  for  a  long  time.  I  am  constantly  being</span><span>  attacked  by  direct-maii  advertisers  and  others  for  this</span><span>  point  of  view.  If  I  am  wrong,  then  nearly  every  other</span><span>  store  in  America  is  wrong,  with  hardly  an  exception,</span><span>  they  all  spend  by  far  the  greatest  portion  of  their</span><span>  advertising  money  in  the  newspaper.  And  a  quarter  of  a</span><span>  million  merchants  in  the  United  States  can't  be  wrong.'</span><span>  The  right  kind  of  advertising,  Mr.  Collins  writes,</span><span>  could  end  the  hoarding  that  is  held  responsible  for  the</span><span>  4  continued  slump.</span><span>  I  'On  the  one  hand,  as  I  have  said,  we  have  an  over</span><span>  abundance  of  goods.  On  the  other  hand  we  have  a</span><span>  massive  reservoir  of  inactive  consumer  purchasing</span><span>  ability  in  our  banks.  Between  the  two  lies  a  frame  of</span><span>  mind.  That  frame  of  mind  is,  without  qualification,</span><span>  advertising's  responsibility.  Advertising  could  easily</span><span>  change  that  frame  of  mind,  but  we  who  write  advertising</span><span>  have  written  the  wrong  kind.  We  have  fallen  down  on</span><span>  the  job.  We  have  failed  both  to  understand  that  frame</span><span>  of  mind  as  it  exists  and  we  have  failed  to  direct  it  into</span><span>  a  buying  mood.</span><span>  'It  is  a  blunder  to  allow  newspaper  and  magazine</span><span>  advertising  lineage  to  materially  decrease  as  pessimism</span><span>  mounts.  If  we  subscribe  to  the  thesis  that  buying  is</span><span>  essential  at  this  time,  then  this  is  decidedly  not  the  time</span><span>  to  curtail  our  promotional  activities.  The  stores  that</span><span>  have  continued  the  intelligent,  sound,  aggressive  adver</span><span>  tising  campaigns  have  fared  better  of  late  than  those</span><span>  stores  which  have  curtailed  too  rigidly.
