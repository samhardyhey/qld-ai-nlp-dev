'The  Board  had</span><span>  carried  this  out  very  satisfactorily,'</span><span>  added  Mr.  Daley.</span><span>  CHAIRMAN'S  ADDRESS.</span><span>  The  year  under  review  has  given</span><span>  much  concern  and  worry  to  all  dairy</span><span>  farmers  in  Maleny  district.  A  district</span><span>  noted  for  its  reliable  and  regular  rain</span><span>  fall,  the  year  just  passed  has  been  an</span><span>  abnormally  dry  one,  and  not  only  has</span><span>  butter  Deduction  been  reduced  to  only</span><span>  70  per  cent,  of  the  previous  year,  but</span><span>  scarcity  of  pasture  has  left  many  dairy</span><span>  herds  very  low  in  condition  to  face</span><span>  what  appears  to  be  another  dry  season.</span><span>  It  is  safe  to  estimate  that  through</span><span>  the  low  production  of  cream,  purchase</span><span>  of  fodder  for  cattle,  pigs  and  calves,</span><span>  and  the  lesser  number  of  pigs  fattened</span><span>  as  baconers,  that  Maleny  district,  com</span><span>  prising  260  suppliers,  has  between</span><span>  £30,000  and  £40,000  less  money  in  cir</span><span>  culation  than  the  previous  year.</span><span>  Fortunately,  the  butter  market  in  the</span><span>  United  Kingdom  showed  an  improve</span><span>  ment  during  the  year,  and  at  present</span><span>  the  market  is  higher  than  it  has  been</span><span>  for  several  years,  being  quoted  at  126/-.</span><span>  It  must  be  apparent  to  all  who  have</span><span>  considered  the  export  butter  market,</span><span>  how  greatly  we  are  dependent  on  the</span><span>  United  Kingdom  market  for  the  sale</span><span>  of  practically  all  of  our  export  butter.</span><span>  The  purchasing  power  of  the  popu</span><span>  lation  in  the  United  Kingdom  has  been</span><span>  greatly  improved,  due,  to  a  large  ex</span><span>  tent,  to  the  vast  expenditure  on  arma</span><span>  ments  and  the  reduction  of  the  number</span><span>  of  unemployed.  The  increased  pur</span><span>  chasing  power  of  the  British  public  is</span><span>  illustrated  by  the  fact  that  although</span><span>  the  prices  ruling  on  the  London  Pro</span><span>  vision  Exchange  was  11  per  cent,  above</span><span>  the  previous  year,  the  United  Kingdom</span><span>  consumption  of  imported  butter  de</span><span>  clined  by  less  than  2  per  cent.  The</span><span>  average  net  United  Kingdom  con</span><span>  sumption  of  imported  butter  is  approx</span><span>  imately  9,200  tons  weekly.</span><span>  Our  co-operative  selling  organisation</span><span>  in  the  United  Kingdom  known  as  Em</span><span>  pire  Dairies  Ltd.  has  had  a  most  suc</span><span>  cessful  year,  arid  the  monetary  turn</span><span>  over  for  the  year  ending  March,  1937,</span><span>  exceeded  £6,000,000  sterling  (being  £6,</span><span>  715,612).</span><span>  Branches  are  now  firmly  established</span><span>  at  Liverpool,  Manchester,  Glasgow,</span><span>  Nottingham,  Bristol,  Cardiff,  Birming</span><span>  ham  and  Newcastle-on-Tyne.</span><span>  It  is  gratifying  to  note  that  another</span><span>  substantial  rebate  in  cash  has  been  re</span><span>  ceived  from  our  co-op,  selling  organisa</span><span>  tion  in  London,  amounting  this  year</span><span>  to  £229.</span><span>  Since  last  October  the  Butter  Board</span><span>  decided  to  take  control  of  the  sale  of</span><span>  butter  on  the  Brisbane  market,  and</span><span>  has  been  successful  in  securing  for  the</span><span>  Butter  Associations  a  substantial  cash</span><span>  rebate  with  their  pat  butter  operations.</span><span>  The  Dairy  Produce  Export  Board</span><span>  continued  to  regulate  shipments  of  but</span><span>  ter  to  the  United  Kingdom,  this  tend</span><span>  ing  to  maintain  the  market  at  a  more</span><span>  uniform  level.</span><span>  Dealing  with  the  monthly  pays  dur</span><span>  ing  the  year  and  those  of  recent</span><span>  months  in  particular,  the  chairman</span><span>  'said  that  the  directors  had  given  every</span><span>  consideration  to  this  matter,  and  taken</span><span>  a  particularly  broader  view  than  actual</span><span>  principle  of  the  matter.  These  pays</span><span>  had  really  been  in  excess  of  actual</span><span>  marketing  value.  His  view  of  this  sys</span><span>  tem  was  that  the  directors  were  keep</span><span>  ing  the  suppliers  together  and  felt  sure</span><span>  that  they  had  done  the  right  thing</span><span>  (Hear,  hear).  As  far  as  a  uniform</span><span>  system  of  payment  to  suppliers</span><span>  throughout  the  North  Coast  by  Maleny</span><span>  and  neighbouring  factories  was  con</span><span>  cerned,  Mr.  Daley  added  that  Maleny.</span><span>  Association  was  ever  ready  to  meet</span><span>  directors  of  other  factories  to  arrive  at</span><span>  some  amicable  decision  in  regard  to</span><span>  a  uniform  price  to  suppliers,  but  to</span><span>  date  it  had  not  been  successful.  They</span><span>  had  one  or  two  suppliers  who  delivered</span><span>  to  Maleny  factory  and  received  defer</span><span>  red  payment,  and  then  immediately</span><span>  supplied  to  other  factories  to  secure  a</span><span>  better  price.  .</span><span>  Mr.  A.  C.  K.  Cooke:  They  ought  to</span><span>  be  ashamed  of  themselves.</span><span>  The  chairman  said  that  Maleny</span><span>  directors  were  always  ready  to  meet</span><span>  other  associations  to  arrive  at  a  more</span><span>  equitable  pay.  _  ,</span><span>  Dealing  with  the  Inspector  of  But</span><span>  ter  Factories'  report  of  March,  WdT,</span><span>  in  which  he  reported  that  the  build</span><span>  ings  at  the  factory  were  dilapidated,</span><span>  Mr.  Daley  reviewed  the  action  of  the</span><span>  directors  arid  interviews  with  the  in</span><span>  spector,  Director  of  Marketing  (Mr.</span><span>  Heers).  and  lastly,  the  Minister  for</span><span>  Agriculture  (Mr.  P.  W.  Bulcock).  He</span><span>  had  explained  the  position  and  asked</span><span>  that  any  action  to  enforce  the  build</span><span>  ing  of  a  new  factory  be  deferred  for</span><span>  a  period  of  five  years.  He  had  em</span><span>  phasised  that  only  260  suppliers  would</span><span>  be  called  upon  to  pay  for  the  factory</span><span>  Continuing,  the  chairman  said  tnat</span><span>  the  quality  of  the  factory's  product</span><span>  had  not  been  affected,  and  as  an  ex</span><span>  ample  he  stated  that  1490  boxes  of</span><span>  butter  had  been  sold  on  the  Brisbane</span><span>  market  for  local  consumption.  He  had</span><span>  been  informed  by  Mr.  Bulcock  that  he</span><span>  (Mr.  Bulcock)  was  not  prepared  to</span><span>  express  an  opinion  until  he  had  seen</span><span>  the  plant  for  himself.  Mr.  Bulcock</span><span>  had  subsequently  inspected  the  fac</span><span>  tory.  'This  morning,'  said  Mr.</span><span>  Daley,  'I  communicated  with  Mr.  Bul</span><span>  ccck  and  he  replied  that  if  this  sea</span><span>  son  proves  adverse,  or  if  the  conditions</span><span>  for  a  period  immediately  preceding  the</span><span>  end  of  the  financial  year  .proves  ad</span><span>  verse,  he  certainly  would  not  insist  on</span><span>  building  immediately,  but  would  give</span><span>  a  further  extension  of  time.'</span><span>  Referring  to  the  produce  supply  sec</span><span>  tion  of  the  factory,  Mr.  Daley  said  that</span><span>  this  section  was  handled,  admirably</span><span>  throughout  the  season.  Only  a  profit</span><span>  cf  £200  was  made  from  this  section,</span><span>  and  they  were  able  to  give  concessions</span><span>  to  farmers.</span><span>  Mr.  Evans  asked  if  the  produce  was</span><span>  purchased  from  one  firm  only.</span><span>  The  chairman:  No.  We  buy  from</span><span>  several  firms.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  W.  Aplin  jnr.  said  he  did  .not</span><span>  agree  with  the  chairman.  He  cited</span><span>  an  instance  where  he  could  buy  barb</span><span>  wire  at  2/6  cheaper  and  cement  1/3</span><span>  per  bag  cheaper  than  that  supplied  by</span><span>  Maleny  factory.</span><span>  In  reply  to  a  suggestion  regarding</span><span>  the  scrapping  of  the  F.C.D.  Co.,  the</span><span>  chairman  informed  the  meeting  that</span><span>  any  supplier  who  had  shares  in  the</span><span>  P.C.D.  Co.  and  desired  to  cash  in,  the</span><span>  P.C.D.  would  pay  £1  for  every  share</span><span>  available.  He  was  very  conversant</span><span>  with  F.C.D.  matters,  and  he  was  aurte</span><span>  confident  that  shares  would  further</span><span>  improve.  He  contended  that  market</span><span>  ing  conditions  overseas  required  great</span><span>  er  consideration  than  ever  before.  Re</span><span>  plying  to  a  further  remark  relative  tc</span><span>  the  shares  in  the  F.C.D.  Co.  coming:</span><span>  out  of  the  cream  can,  the  chairman,</span><span>  said  that  the  increase  in  shares  had</span><span>  come  about  by  rebates.  Prior  to  the</span><span>  formation  of  the  F.C.D.  the  suppliers</span><span>  were  prepared  to  pay  the  proprietary</span><span>  man  without  murmur.</span><span>  After  further  questions,  regarding:</span><span>  items  in  the  balance  sheet,  the  chair</span><span>  man  formally  moved  the  adoption  of</span><span>  the  report  and  balance  sheet.</span><span>  Mr.  Harch  seconded  and  the  mo</span><span>  tion  was  carried.</span><span>  MOTION  TO  RESCIND</span><span>  RESOLUTION  FOR  PAYMENT  OF</span><span>  DIVIDEND  ON  CAPITAL.</span><span>  Mr.  R.  V.  D.  Cox,  upon  notice,</span><span>  formally  moved  that  a  resolution  re</span><span>  corded  in  the  minutes  of  a  general</span><span>  meeting  of  shareholders  Field  on'  .the</span><span>  29th  March  1913  (as  follow,  viz:  'Tfciat</span><span>  in  future  provision  be  made  for  a  5</span><span>  per  cent,  dividend  on  the  paid-up</span><span>  capital'),  be  and  is  hereby  rescindeti.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Cox  said  that  this  resolution</span><span>  had  been  moved  over  20  years  ago,</span><span>  and  quite  a  lot  had  happened  since</span><span>  that  time.  Under  the  Income  Tax</span><span>  Assessment  Act  they  were  assessed,  at</span><span>  4/-  in  the  £  for  ircome  tax,  involving</span><span>  an  amount  of  £80.  He  thought  it  wiser</span><span>  to  keep  the  money  in  the  district.  It</span><span>  was  considered  advisable  for  suppliers</span><span>  who  held  a  surplus  over  the  minimum</span><span>  number  of  shares  to  support  the  re</span><span>  solution.</span><span>  Mr.  C.  A.  Harch  seconded  the  re</span><span>  solution.</span><span>  Mr.  Daley  said  the  resolution  was</span><span>  most  unfair.  It  was  simply  a  resolu</span><span>  tion  refusing  to  pay  the  man  who  had</span><span>  put  his  capital-  into  the  association  5</span><span>  per  cent,  for  his  investment.</span><span>  In  reply,  Mr.  Cox  said  that  the  mo</span><span>  tion  was  simply  one  to  rescind  a  resolu</span><span>  tion  of  1913.  The  directors  still  had</span><span>  the  power  to  recommend  a  dividend</span><span>  from  time  to  time.</span><span>  The  motion  was  lost.  Twenty  share</span><span>  holders  voted  in  the  affirmative  and  32</span><span>  recorded  in  the  negative.</span><span>  APPOINTMENT  OF  AUDITOR.</span><span>  On  the  resolution  by  Messrs.  W.</span><span>  Aplin  Snr.  and  Porter,  Mr.  Wm.  M.</span><span>  Holloway  was  re-elected  auditor.  Mr.</span><span>  Holloway  briefly  returned  thanks.</span><span>  NEW  FACTORY  PROPOSAL.</span><span>  On  the  motion  of  Mr.  A.  C.  K.  Cooke,</span><span>  the  meeting  decided  that  debenture</span><span>  holders  be  paid  up  in  full,  at  the  dis</span><span>  cretion  of  the  directors,  and  that  the</span><span>  Minister  for  Agirculture  be  thanked</span><span>  for  his  sympathetic  attitude  towards</span><span>  an  extension  of  time  in  regard  to  the</span><span>  new  factory  proposal.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Cooke  said  he  understood  the</span><span>  directors  would  give  consideration  to</span><span>  plans  etc.,  and  finance.</span><span>  *  Mr.  W.  Aplin  Snr.,  moved,  'That  the</span><span>  suppliers  of  this  Association  view  with</span><span>  consternation  the  proposal  to  immedi</span><span>  ately  proceed  with  the  erection  of  a</span><span>  new  factory,  and  insist  that  full  ad</span><span>  vantage  be  taken  of  Mr.  Bulcock's  offer</span><span>  of  the  5th  July  last;  that  before  call</span><span>  ing  tenders  expert  advice  be  obtained</span><span>  as  to  plant  and  materials,  suitable  site,</span><span>  water  problem,  etc.,  and  also,  that  be</span><span>  fore  finalising  matters  approval  of  sup</span><span>  pliers  be  sought.</span><span>  Mr.  W.  R.  King  seconded.</span><span>  Mr.  E.  Thynne  moved  an  amendment</span><span>  that  it  be  an  instruction  to  the  board</span><span>  of  directors  that  they  employ  a  quali</span><span>  fied  architect  to  draw  up  plans  and</span><span>  specifications  for  the  proposed  factory,</span><span>  and  further,  they  submit  the  plans  and</span><span>  specifications  to  a  special  meeting  of</span><span>  shareholders  to  be  called  on  31st  May,</span><span>  1938.</span><span>  Mr.  Lovegrove  seconded.</span><span>  Mr.  J.

He  refused  to  in</span><span>  clude  the  suggestion  in  the  amendment.</span><span>  The  amendment  was  lost  and  the</span><span>  motion  declared  carried.</span><span>  Mr.  Grigor  moved  that  an  estimate</span><span>  be  obtained  for  bringing  the  present</span><span>  factory  up  to  the  reauired  standard,</span><span>  and  'to  comply  with  Government</span><span>  regulations.</span><span>  ?
