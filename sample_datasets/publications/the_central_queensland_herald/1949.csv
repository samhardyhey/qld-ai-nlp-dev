Its  scale  was  14.5</span><span>  miles  to  the  inch,  and  the</span><span>  area  was  the  ""settled  part  ol</span><span>  the  colony  south  of  Cape  Pal-</span><span>  marston,  including  parts  of  the</span><span>  Leichhardt  and  Maranoa  dis-</span></p> <p><span>  tricts.""  Many  of  the  data  used</span><span>  were  from  official  sources,</span><span>  and  having  regard  to  the</span><span>  times  and  crude  facilities,  the</span><span>  map  was  ""reasonably  accur-</span><span>  ate""</span></p> <p><span>  This  map  was  followed  in</span><span>  1863  by  one  of  the  whole  of</span><span>  Queensland,  which  was  Litho-</span></p> <p><span>  graphed  by  Thos.  Ham  and:</span><span>  Co,  and  published  by  J.  W.</span><span>  Buxton.  Its  scale  was  41  1/4</span><span>  miles  to  the  inch  and  It  set</span><span>  out  the  principal  pastoral  dis-</span><span>  tricts,  as  well  as  the  explor-</span><span>  ing  routes  of  Landsborough,</span><span>  Walker,  Burke  and  Wills  and</span></p> <p><span>  Kennedy.  It  will  probably</span><span>  never  be  known  why  it  did  not</span><span>  show  Leichhardt's  wanderings.</span></p> <p><span>  The  third  map  was  publish-</span><span>  ed  in  1871  by  the  Government.</span><span>  The  scale  was  about  24  miles</span><span>  to  an  Inch,  the  .compilation</span><span>  was  by  Thos.  Ham,  the  en-</span><span>  graving  by  Wm.  Knight,  and</span><span>  ""everything  considered,  this</span><span>  was  an  excellent  production.""</span><span>  A  map  showing  the  pastoral</span><span>  runs  southwards  from  Broad-</span><span>  sound  as  far  west  as  Long-</span><span>  reach  and  Thargomindah  was</span><span>  brought  out  by  the  Govern-</span><span>  ment  in  1872,  the  scale  being</span><span>  12  miles  to  the  inch.  The</span><span>  next  map,  prepared  for  the</span><span>  Educational  Department  in</span><span>  1877,  was  of  the  whole  State,</span><span>  on  a  scale  of  27  miles  to  the</span><span>  inch,  and  was  used  in  its  or-</span><span>  iginal  and  reduced  form  ""for</span><span>  various  useful  purposes""  for</span><span>  many  years.</span></p> <p><span>  A  16-mile  to  the  inch  map</span><span>  of  the  whole  State  was  pub-</span><span>  lished  in  1881,  and  ""showed</span><span>  most  of  the  main  features  in</span><span>  approximately  correct  posi-</span><span>  tions.""  But  with  surveys  ex-</span><span>  tending  as  settlement  expand-</span><span>  ed  maps  of  this  nature  were</span><span>  soon  out  of  date,  so  that  in</span><span>  1883  a  complete  reconstruc-</span><span>  tion  of  the  State  map  was</span><span>  contemplated.  This  was  ne-</span><span>  cessary  in  order  to  fix  accur-</span></p> <p><span>  ately  the  western  part  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  State  with  the  South  Austra-</span><span>  lian  boundary,  to  which  end</span><span>  the  positions  of  Boulia,  Black-</span><span>  all  and  Roma  were  determin-</span></p> <p><span>  ed  astronomically.  Unfortun-</span><span>  ately,  Nemesis  overtook  the</span><span>  unbalanced  land  boom  tha</span><span>  bad  raged  for  years  before</span><span>  anything  could  be  started,  and</span><span>  other  than  a  vote  of  Â£500  to</span><span>  engrave  the  1881  map  little</span><span>  was  done.  But  the  engraving</span><span>  was  never  done,  because  photo-</span><span>  graphy  was  so  developed  that</span></p> <p><span>  maps  ""practically  as  good  as</span><span>  engravings  could  be  produced</span><span>  at  far  less  cost,  and  can,  be</span><span>  .more  easily  revised  and  im-</span><span>  proved.""</span></p> <p><span>  By  1882  the  financial  storm</span><span>  was  abating,  and  the  syste-</span><span>  matic  compilation  of  maps  was</span><span>  inaugurated.  It  was  arranged</span><span>  for  all  maps  to  be  drawn  on</span><span>  the  same  projection,  uniformly</span><span>  divided  into  sheets  on  a  stan-</span><span>  dard  scale  of  2  miles  to  an</span><span>  inch,  and  from  this  photo-</span><span>  graphic  reductions  to  4  miles,</span></p> <p><span>  8  miles  and  16  miles  to  an</span><span>  inch  were  readily  obtained.</span><span>  But  owing  to  staff  shortages,</span><span>  this  project  did  not  get  past</span><span>  the  planning  stage,  and  to  keep</span><span>  pace  with  growing  demands</span><span>  the  1881  map  was  ""thoroughly</span><span>  revised,  extended  to  include</span><span>  New  Guinea  and  an  inset  map</span><span>  of  Australasia""  and  published</span><span>  in  1894.  A  school  map</span><span>  ""very  complete  for  educational</span><span>  purposes""  was  published  in</span><span>  1883.  It  was  on  a  scale  of</span><span>  27  miles  to  an  inch,  and  was</span><span>  printed  in  colours  on  four</span><span>  sheets,  the  3250  complete  maps</span><span>  occupying  65  days  in  printing</span><span>  alone.</span></p> <p><span>  By  now  the  1883  reconstruc-</span></p> <p><span>  tion  plan  was  taking</span><span>  shape,  and  the  production  of</span><span>  accurate  maps  for  a  large</span><span>  State  the  size  of  Queensland</span><span>  was  progressing  steadily.</span><span>  World  War  11  so  near  to  our</span><span>  door  gave  us  the  magnificent</span><span>  military  maps  which  it  is  a</span><span>  sheer  delight  to  read,  and  a</span><span>  veritable  Cook's  tour  to  study</span><span>  The  pioneering  days  of  map</span><span>  making  are  now  but  a  distant</span><span>  memory;  but  as  we  have  seen</span><span>  they  had  their  riddles,  their</span><span>  tribulations  and  also  their</span><span>  triumphs.</span></p> <p><span>  WORLD  FOOD  AND  SOIL  FERTILITY</span></p> <p><span>  IT  Is  not  safe  to  generalise</span><span>  about  so  diverse  a  problem</span></p> <p><span>  as  feeding  a  world.

The  Governments  seem</span><span>  to  be  quite  satisfied  with</span><span>  filling  up  the  vast  empty  spaces</span><span>  of  former  munitions  factories</span><span>  at  Bocklea  and  Fisherman's</span><span>  Bend  with  private  firms.  There</span><span>  was  nothing  to  prevent  many</span><span>  of  these  new  industries  open</span><span>  ing  up  in  country  towns  like</span><span>  Townsville  and  Rcckhampton,</span><span>  if  the  Governments  hud  raised</span><span>  the  question  with  the  firms</span><span>  and  had  offered  them  special</span><span>  Inducements  to  go  outside  the</span><span>  capitals.'</span></p> <p><span>  -  Last  fiscal  year  the  State</span><span>  Statistician  reports  Queensland</span><span>  industry  turned  out  work</span><span>  valued  at  Â£125,000,000-an  in</span><span>  crease  of  25  per.  cent  above  the</span><span>  previous  record  year.

He  points  out</span><span>  that  more  than  half  of  all  the</span><span>  State's  industry  is  centred  in</span><span>  Brisbane.  Only  7  per  cent  is</span><span>  in  Central  Queensland  and  20</span><span>  per  cent  each  in  the  Southern</span><span>  and  Northern  Divisions.  Com</span><span>  menting  on  these  statistics  the</span><span>  Brisbane  ""Courier-Mail,""  which</span><span>  can  hardly  be  regarded  t  an</span><span>  ardent  advocate  of  taking  any</span><span>  thing  away  from  the  metro</span><span>  polis,  says  editorially:  '""Hiis</span><span>  unhealthy  centralisation  can</span><span>  be  blamed  in  part  on  the  Gov</span></p> <p><span>  ernment's  differential  railway</span><span>  rates  which,  favour  Brisbane</span><span>  and  place  country  manufac</span><span>  turers  at  a  serious  disadvant</span></p> <p><span>  age  '.If  rates,  were  adjusted  to</span></p> <p><span>  encourage  decentralisation  it</span><span>  would  greatly  benefit  the  State</span></p> <p><span>  as  a  whole.""</span></p> <p><span>  That  is  something  of  an  ad</span><span>  mission  from  that  source,  and</span><span>  it  seems  to  be  shared  by  other</span><span>  journalists.

Now  that  there</span><span>  is  a  sign  of  awakening,  what</span><span>  measure  of  aid  is  the  South</span><span>  disposed  to  give?  Something</span><span>  more,  it  is  to  be  hoped,  than</span><span>  the  advice  of  the  president  of</span><span>  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  to</span><span>  develop  our  land  and  mineral</span><span>  resources  and  provldfe  more</span><span>  amenities  to  attract  popula</span><span>  tion.  We  must  not  expect  to</span><span>  go  to  the  Government  for</span><span>  everything;  there  has  already</span><span>  been  too  strong*  a  tendency  in</span><span>  that  direction.  But  there  re</span><span>  quires  to  be  a  radical  change</span><span>  in  matters  for  which  the  Gov</span><span>  ernments  can  be  held  rerpons.</span><span>  ible.</span></p> <p><span>  FINDING  PLACES  FOR  THE  DISPLACED.</span></p> <p><span>  rptHE  Minister  for  Migration</span></p> <p><span>  has  issued  a  statement  set</span><span>  ting  out  the  manner  in  which</span><span>  displaced  persons  from  Eur</span><span>  ope  are  being  absorbed  into</span><span>  Australian  industry.  This</span><span>  shows  that  more  than  50  per</span><span>  cent  of  all  D.P's.  brought  out</span><span>  thus  far  are  working  in</span><span>  ccyntry  areas-on  road  awl</span><span>  railway  construction,  farming,</span><span>  water  storage1,  afforestation,</span><span>  timber  getting  ""and  other  es</span><span>  sential  jobs  foT  which  suffi</span><span>  cient  Australian  labour  is  not</span><span>  offering.""  Of  more  than  20,000</span><span>  such  persons,  14,529  are  thus</span><span>  employed,  of  whom  NSW  has</span><span>  4359,  South  Australia  3586,</span><span>  Victoria  3217,  Tasmania  1811,</span><span>  Westralia  1090  and  Queensland</span><span>  -the  most  dependent  of  all</span><span>  the  States  on  rural  industry</span><span>  brings  up  the  rear  with  937.</span></p> <p><span>  A  survey  of  the  contribu</span><span>  tion  displaced  persons  labour</span><span>  is  making  to  rural  areas  shows</span><span>  that  2001  are  employed  on</span><span>  railway  construction,  mostly  in</span><span>  the  country,  1506  on  water</span><span>  storage  and  reticulation,  414</span><span>  on  road  construction  and</span><span>  maintenance  in  outlying  areas,</span><span>  781  on  afforestation,  and'  959</span><span>  on  timber  getting  and  milling.</span><span>  Fruit  and  vegetable  produc</span><span>  tion  gives  occupation  to  116</span><span>  permanently,  and  714  season</span><span>  ally.  There  are  430  employed  in</span><span>  dairying  and  in  the  pig  farm</span><span>  ing,  wheat,  poultry,  sugar  and</span><span>  pastoral  industries.  The  con</span><span>  tribution  of  these  people  to  the</span><span>  solution  of  Australia's  labour</span><span>  problem  has  been  a  notable</span><span>  one,  says  Mr  Calwell.  They</span><span>  have  been  particularly  valu</span><span>  able  in  industries  which,  be</span><span>  cause  of  arduous  work  or  iso</span><span>  lated  localities,  could  not  at</span><span>  tract  and  hold  sufficient  Aus</span></p> <p><span>  tralian  labour</span></p> <p><span>  In  all  cases  the  new  settlers</span><span>  are  adapting  themselves  well</span><span>  to  their  work,  and  their  ser</span><span>  vices  have  been  applauded  by</span><span>  employers.  Not  the  least  of  the*</span><span>  advantages  is  that  country</span><span>  centres  enjoy  extra  spending</span><span>  power  in  their  communities,</span><span>  whilst  the  infusion  of  people</span><span>  with  a  background  of  culture</span><span>  is  bound  to  bring  many  bene</span><span>  fits.  The  Minister  says  tfie</span><span>  Commonwealth  Government</span><span>  hopes  to  assist  rural  centres</span><span>  ?further  with  labour  from  the</span><span>  European  migrant  stream.  Ad</span><span>  ditional  categories  in  which</span><span>  they  can  be  employed  have</span></p> <p><span>  i  been  framed  and  an  appeal  is</span><span>  made  to  employers  to  avail</span></p> <p><span>  themselves  of  this  labour.  |</span></p> <p><span>  Perhaps  the  most  gratifying</span><span>  feature  of  the  Ministerial</span><span>  statement  is  the  knowledge</span><span>  that  Australia's  new  citizens</span><span>  are  of  a  type  who  are  willing</span><span>  and  eager  to  adapt  themselves</span><span>  to  new  conditions  and  take,  on</span><span>  work  which  in  the  words  of  the</span><span>  Minister  ""cannot  attract  and</span><span>  hold  Australian  labour.""

That  Is  not  now</span><span>  the  case.  A  scarcity  of  train</span><span>  ed  personnel  exists  In  practic</span><span>  ally  all  trades  In  Australia,</span><span>  and  the  number  of  boys  and</span><span>  girls  who  are  willing  to  enter</span><span>  what  are  regarded  as  ""dirty""</span><span>  trades  Is  comparatively  fear</span><span>  alongside  those  attracted  to</span><span>  other  callings,  including  dead</span><span>  end  jobs.  It  is  a  problem</span><span>  which  is  causing  headaches</span><span>  to  employers,  and  many  de</span><span>  vices  have  been  tried  to  at</span><span>  tract  youth  to  learn  trades</span><span>  to  which  at  one  time</span></p> <p><span>  their  parents  would  almost</span><span>  have'  gone  op.  their  knees  to</span><span>  have  them  apprenticed.

Young  people,  with  a</span><span>  talent  for  skilled  crafts,  who</span><span>  live  In  districts  where  train</span><span>  ing  Is  not  normally  available</span><span>  are  offered  grants  to  enable</span><span>  them  to  train  in  areas  away</span><span>  from  their  homes.  Juveniles</span><span>  receiving  this  opportunity  are</span><span>  those  who  are  Just  about  to</span><span>  start  work,  are  unemployed  or</span><span>  are  in  dead-end  Jobs.

In</span><span>  the  days  of  pioneer  immigra</span><span>  tion  the  divisional  centres,  la</span><span>  eluding  Roekhampton,  had</span><span>  their  own  depots,  which  re</span><span>  ceived  the  migrants  and  saw</span><span>  to  their  distribution  to  em</span><span>  ployers.

Prob</span><span>  ably  140,000  dwellings,  in</span><span>  cluding  some  of  a,  tem</span><span>  porary  nature,  have  been</span><span>  completed  since  the  war,  pro</span><span>  Tiding  housing  for  600,000  per</span><span>  sons.  Queensland  makes  a</span><span>  aomewhat  extraordinary  con</span><span>  tribution  to  these  totals.  Whilst</span><span>  this  State  completed  propor</span><span>  tionately  more  dwellings  since</span><span>  the  war  than  any  other  Stat?</span><span>  It  was  the  only  one  to  show  a</span><span>  decrease  last  year  as  com</span><span>  pared  with  1947  -  300  fewer</span><span>  houses  and  flats  being  com</span><span>  pleted  during  the  latter  period.</span><span>  Zt  would  be  gratifying  if  this</span><span>  could  be  interpreted  as  an  in</span><span>  dication  that  we  had  over</span><span>  taken  the  housing  lag.</span></p> <p><span>  This,  however,  i6  not  the</span><span>  case,  but  in  the  words  of  the</span><span>  Commonwealth  Director  is</span><span>  ""due  to  a  marked  reduction  in</span><span>  activity  of  owner  builders.""</span><span>  And  that  simply  bears  out  the</span><span>  oft  reiterated  complaint  that</span><span>  'building  costs  have  got  so</span><span>  high  as  to  place  owning  a</span><span>  home  beyond  the  reach  of</span><span>  most  wage  and  salary  earners,</span><span>  so  that  they  have  ""given</span><span>  away""  the  idea  and  are  con</span><span>  triving  to  make  shift  In  some</span><span>  other  way.  Thus  practically</span><span>  the  only  building  activity  is</span><span>  that  -conducted  by  the  Hour</span><span>  ing  Commission  and  other  gov</span><span>  ernmental  agencies,  which  Is</span><span>  one  of  the  least  healthy  sign.*</span><span>  of  the  whole  business.</span></p> <p><span>  This  is  the  state  we  have</span><span>  reached  three  years  after  the</span></p> <p><span>  end  of  the  war.  If  there  was  j</span><span>  one  phase  of  post-war  recon-  j</span></p> <p><span>  struction  which  was  looked  to</span><span>  with  confidence  It  was  that  re</span></p> <p><span>  lating  to  the  housing  problem.;</span><span>  Its  urgency  had  clearly  Im</span><span>  pressed  Itself  on  the  public</span></p> <p><span>  mind  before  the  end  of  hos</span><span>  tilities,  and  it  had  seemingly</span><span>  received  (he  closest  attention</span><span>  of  the  relevant  Government</span></p> <p><span>  1  agencies,  so  that  the  task  ap</span><span>  l  peared  to  be  thoroughly  envis</span><span>  aged  and  the  necessary  meas</span><span>  ures  planned  to  meet  It.  The</span><span>  training  scheme,  to  turn  out</span><span>  skilled  and  semi-skilled  build</span><span>  ing  artisans  captured  the  pub</span><span>  lic  imagination  and  appealed</span><span>  strongly  to  ex-service  person</span><span>  nel,  as  was  shown  by  the</span><span>  heavy  enrolment  of  young  men</span><span>  who  wished  to  become  carpen</span><span>  ters,  plumbers  and  bricklayers</span><span>  But  alas  for  these  bright  hopes.</span><span>  The  Government  allowed  itself</span><span>  to  be  bullied  into  dropping  the</span><span>  training  scheme,  and  that</span><span>  practically  sealed  the  fate  of</span><span>  the  housing  programme,</span><span>  though  it  was  not  the  sole</span></p> <p><span>  cause.</span></p> <p><span>  It  has  now  become  painfully</span><span>  clear  that  Australia  will  have</span><span>  a  housing  problem  lor  many</span><span>  years  to  come.  The  rate  of</span><span>  building  has  got  down  to  about</span><span>  60,000  a  year.  That  number</span><span>  will  be  commenced  this  year,</span><span>  but  the  Commonwealth  Direc</span><span>  tor  holds  out  no  hope  of  more</span><span>  than  56,000  being  completed.</span><span>  This  is  a  sad  falling  away  from</span><span>  the  original  yearly  target  of</span><span>  80,000  new  dwellings  by  the</span><span>  third  post-war  year,  of  which</span><span>  only  50,000  materialised.

With  only</span><span>  120,000  completed  up  to  the</span><span>  end  of  last  year  we  have  fallen</span><span>  further  into  arrears,  and  It</span><span>  looks  as  though  It  will  be</span><span>  nearer  15  years  than  five  be</span><span>  fore  the  housing  position  be</span></p> <p><span>  comes  normal.</span></p> ",Article,1949-05-12,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD Rockhampton Thursday, May 12, 1949.

Hence  the  Rockhamp</span><span>  ton  Court  last  week  was  under</span><span>  the-necessity  of  remarking  that</span><span>  whilst  the  general,  prosperity</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  pastoral  Industry  was</span><span>  acknowledged  no  figures  had</span><span>  been  produced  by  the  Crown,</span><span>  which  was  seeking  Increased</span><span>  rentals,  -  in  showing  '  the  ac</span><span>  tual  production  costs  on  in</span><span>  dividual  holdings  In  relation</span><span>  to  the  higher  profits,  nor  to</span><span>  the  effect  of  .'age  increases,;</span><span>  shortages  of  labour  and  ma</span><span>  terial,  and  increased  mainten</span><span>  ance  costs  in  keeping</span><span>  down  suckers  and-  seedlings</span><span>  on  ringbarked  country.  Nor</span><span>  had  toy  such  figures  been</span><span>  produced  by  the  lessees.  Thus</span><span>  s  the  Court  had  been  left  with*</span></p> <p><span>  out  much  material  Informa</span><span>  tion.</span></p> <p><span>  In  seeking  Increased  rentals</span><span>  the  Chief  -Assessor  of  the  Df</span><span>  {Mrtanent  of  lands  contended</span><span>  that  the  rent  charges  now</span><span>  prevailing  were  seriously  out</span><span>  of  relationship  to  the  prosper</span><span>  ity  of  the  sheep  and  cattle  In</span><span>  dustries.  Crown  rentals  had</span><span>  Increased  overall  by  16  per</span><span>  Cent  from  the  depression  per</span><span>  iod-19S1-5-and  the  price  of</span><span>  greasy  wool  had  advanced  179</span><span>  per  rant,  fat  bullocks  135  per</span><span>  Cent,  the  total  value  of  sheep</span><span>  production  133  per  .  cent,  total</span><span>  value  of  cattle  production  205</span><span>  per  cent  and  the  total  value</span></p> <p><span>  of  pastoral  production  \  by  148</span><span>  per  cent.  The  prosperity  in</span></p> <p><span>  dex  adopted  showed  an  aver</span><span>  age  bf  80d.  per  lb.  for  greasy</span><span>  wool  and  Â£16/10/-  for  fat  bul</span><span>  locks  which  was  considerably</span><span>  less  than  the  prices  prevailing,</span><span>  over  the  past  two  years  and</span><span>  at  present.  It  was  not  con</span><span>  tended  that  the  rental  value</span><span>  of  Crown  lands  was  governed</span><span>  solely  by  the  market  value  of</span><span>  the  products  derived  from</span><span>  them,  but  It  was  maintained</span><span>  that  the  two  were  closely  re</span></p> <p><span>  lated.</span></p> <p><span>  On  a  superficial  examina</span><span>  tion  the  general  taxpayer,</span><span>  who  has  a  very  clear  under</span><span>  standing  of  the  relation  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  market  value  of  his  own</span><span>  product,  whether  It  be  goods</span><span>  or  labour,  and  the  demands</span><span>  of  foe  crown,  will  be  Inclined</span><span>  to  say  ""Well,  that's  lair</span><span>  enough.""  But  complaint  is</span><span>  made  that  In  the  matter  ot</span><span>  liupd  values  the  Crown  is</span><span>  spiking  with  two  voices.  Tbe""</span><span>  President  of  the  United  Glac</span><span>  iers  Association  points  out</span><span>  that  on  the  one  hand  the</span><span>  Crown  is  demanding:  higher</span><span>  rentals  because  a  new  stand</span></p> <p><span>  values  has  arisen.  But</span></p> <p><span>  wnjSi  it  comes  to  ""freezing""</span></p> <p><span>  land  for  soldier  settlement</span><span>  compensation  to  prestent  hold</span><span>  ers  Is  based  on  1642  values.</span></p> <p><span>  This  does  'not'  present  the</span></p> <p><span>  Crown  in  a  favourable,  or  even</span><span>  a  consistent  light,  and  there</span><span>  is  ground  for  the  contention</span><span>  that  if'owners  of  frozen  land</span><span>  are  to  Quit  their  holdings  at</span><span>  1642  values  and  seek  fresh</span><span>  fields  at  the  new  values  .based</span><span>  on  the  present  exceptional</span><span>  prices  they  are  virtually  pre-,</span><span>  vented  from  re-entering  the</span></p> <p><span>  Industry.  ^</span></p> <p><span>  That  could  be  a  serious  loss</span><span>  to  the  State,  even  though  the</span><span>  Crown  might  be  the  gainer  in</span><span>  the  first  Instance.  This  Is</span><span>  endorsed  by  the  rational  view</span><span>  taken  .by  the  Land  Court  at</span><span>  ftpckhampton  which  laid  It</span><span>  down  that  whilst  it  was  de</span><span>  sirable  that  the  Lands  De</span><span>  partment  be  given  full  scope</span><span>  to  improve  valuation  methods,</span><span>  continued  and  increasing  pro</span><span>  duction  should  not  be  sacri</span><span>  ficed  to  revenue  considera</span><span>  tions.  ""In  the  scale  of  rela</span><span>  tive  importance  to  the  com</span><span>  munity  increased  Crown  rents</span><span>  weigh  lightly  in  comparison</span><span>  with  Increased  production  and</span><span>  progressive  development,""  ob</span><span>  served  Mr  Payne.  ""Queens</span><span>  land  would  become  a  poorer</span></p> <p><span>  place  In  which  to  live  if  rural</span><span>  progress  and  production  were</span><span>  not  to  keep  abreast  of  ln</span><span>  durtcial  development  and</span><span>  poi&nUon.""</span></p> <p><span>  .

In</span><span>  deed,  taking  a  line  through</span><span>  the  current  sittings  it  Is  pos</span><span>  sible  that  the  Land  Court  will</span><span>  have  a  greater  influence  on</span><span>  the  stability  and  prosperity  of</span><span>  the  State  than  the  industrial</span><span>  tribunals  wftlch  loom  sb  much</span><span>  more  prominently  in  the  pub</span><span>  lic  eye.</span></p> <p><span>  MILLIONS  PAID  OUT  FOR  MILK</span></p> <p><span>  ""WITH  Central  Queensland's</span></p> <p><span>  dairying  industry  cetebra</span><span>  thg  its  60th  birthday,  the</span><span>  announcement  that  the</span><span>  Port  Curtis  cooperative</span><span>  Dairy  Association  Ltd  has</span><span>  approved  a  big  programme</span><span>  of  modernisation  estimated  to</span><span>  cost  Â£200,000,  to  include  the</span><span>  erection  of  a  new  Â£100,000,fac</span><span>  tory  in  Rockhampton,  is  pleas</span><span>  .ing  news  to  all  who  are  share</span></p> <p><span>  holders  In  the  prosperity  of  the</span><span>  district.  Such  expansion  proves</span><span>  that  the  industry  has  faith  Mi</span><span>  -  Itself,  and  is  testimony  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  importance  to  which  it  has</span><span>  grown  in  recent  years.  Today</span><span>  dairying  is  one  of  our  .basic:</span><span>  securities.  It  has  brought  con</span><span>  sistent  prosperity  to  the  small</span><span>  landowner  and,  despite  Its  ups</span><span>  and  downs,-has  survived  where</span><span>  some  others  have  failed.  Its</span></p> <p><span>  steady  growth  Is  the  kind  that  I</span><span>  sends  its  roots  deep  down  and  j</span></p> <p><span>  becomes  permanent.  --</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  interesting  to  recall  that</span><span>  this  great  industry  had  its</span><span>  birth  at  Matcham,  near  Grace</span><span>  mere,  towards  the  end  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  last  century.  Messrs  Archer  j</span><span>  Bros  introduced  Ayrshire  cows</span><span>  to  meet  the  milk  needs  of  the</span><span>  growing  city  of  Rockhampton,</span><span>  and  surplus  milk  was  made</span><span>  into  butter  at  Matcham  before</span><span>  refrigeration  was  introduced  to</span><span>  Central  Queensland.  A  butter</span><span>  factory  was  buiit  at  Cap&la</span><span>  about  the  beginning  of  the  cen</span></p> <p><span>  |tury.  Messrs  Conaghan  Bros</span><span>  commenced  commercial  ice</span><span>  manufacture  and  butter  mak</span><span>  ing  in  Rockhampton  in  1904.</span><span>  From  these  small,  hazardous</span><span>  beginnings  the  industry  has</span><span>  grown  to  one  of  the  greatest</span><span>  Importance.  Today,  butter,</span><span>  milk,  cheese  and  ice  cream  are</span><span>  processed  and  the  2614  sup</span><span>  pliers  are  paid  over  Â£2,51)0,000</span></p> <p><span>  for  raw  cream  and  milk.  Hje</span><span>  Association  annually  manufac</span><span>  tures  7000  tons  of  butter  and</span><span>  328  tons  of  cheese.  Suppliers</span><span>  are  paid  Â£103,748  for  milk  for</span><span>  pasteurisation.</span></p> <p><span>  In  these  days  of  high  cost</span><span>  manufacture  and  living  the</span><span>  milk  producer's  success  de</span><span>  pends  upon  his  ability  to  pro</span><span>  cess  cheaply  and'to  market  all</span><span>  he  produces.  Allied  to  such</span><span>  fundamental  things  are  .  the</span><span>  uses  to  which  milk  can  be  put.</span><span>  In  the  last-named  connexion</span><span>  there  has  been  a  tremendous</span><span>  expansion  in  pasteurised</span><span>  milk  and  ice  cream  consump</span><span>  tion  in  the  last  decade.  But</span><span>  such  things  are  comparatively</span><span>  simple  and,  scarcely  new.  So'</span><span>  to  keeÂ£>  pace  with  the  demands</span></p> <p><span>  of  .other  industries  and  to  ex</span><span>  pand  the  uses  of  milk,  the  in</span><span>  dustry  has  followed  the  coal,</span><span>  oil  and  soya  bean  producer  and</span><span>  taken  milk  to  bits.

The  answer  is</span><span>  that  Australia  must  set  about</span><span>  producing  more  of  the  things</span><span>  that  other  countries,  especial</span><span>  ly  dollar  countries,  are  pre</span><span>  pared  to  take  from  us.

The</span></p> <p><span>  value  for  this  season's  clip  1}</span><span>  estimated  to  be  about  Â£186,000,</span><span>  000,  as  against  Â£155,000,000  last</span><span>  year.  These  figures  are  bas:d</span><span>  on  an  estimated  production  of</span><span>  3,180,000  bales,  and  Or  Bsoth</span><span>  says  there  is  no  reason  why</span><span>  Australia  should  not  produce</span><span>  Â£200.000,000  worth  of  wool  an</span><span>  nually.  As  to  our  capacity  to</span><span>  grow  that  quantity  there  should</span><span>  be  little  question.  The  3,163,000</span><span>  bales  marketed  this  year  will</span><span>  come  from  approximately  102,</span><span>  000,000  sheep.  This  year  pro</span><span>  duction  is  548,212  bales  less</span><span>  than  the  record  established  in</span><span>  1843-4  and  the  number  of</span><span>  sheep  on  the  runs  Is  23,000,003</span><span>  fewer  than  the  record  flocks  cf</span><span>  1J41.</span></p> <p><span>  Perhaps  the  strongest  point</span><span>  favouring  a  continuance  of'the</span><span>  keen  demand  and  high  prices  is</span><span>  th&t  all  the  ?lne  merino  wool,</span><span>  of  .which  Australia  Is  the  prin</span><span>  cipal  grower,  has  been  sold</span><span>  frotn  the  stock  plies  accumu</span><span>  lated  during  the  war.

Yet  ,  it</span><span>  would  be.one  of  the  greatest</span><span>  tragedies  In  rural  and  secon</span><span>  dary  Industry  were  this  to  -life</span><span>  permitted  to  happen.  '  The</span><span>  decline*  In  production  has</span><span>  been  much  more  rapid  than</span><span>  Its  growth.  In  1022  when  the'</span><span>  present  phase  of  the  Industry</span><span>  was  v  launched  production</span><span>  stood  at  1572  bales.  From</span><span>  that  point  there  was  a  fairly</span></p> <p><span>  consistent  Increase,  varied</span><span>  only  by  seasonal  conditions,</span><span>  but  when  the  decline  set  In</span><span>  nothing  served  to  check  the</span><span>  downward  trend.  v</span></p> <p><span>  Cotton  in  Queensland  has</span><span>  had  a  chequered  career.;  Its</span><span>  spread  through  the  country</span><span>  was  great  because  propaganda</span><span>  tunes  were  pleasant  to  listen</span><span>  to.  It  was  ""fed  at  the  breast,""</span><span>  and  being  a  new  Industry,  Its</span><span>  natural  enemies,  such  as  the</span><span>  pink  boll  worm,  had  .not  time</span><span>  to  build  up  their  numbers  to</span><span>  pett  proportions.

The</span><span>  grower  was  promised  many</span><span>  things.  He  was  taken  for</span><span>  numerous  rides  on  political</span><span>  merry-go  -rounds  but,  after,  a</span><span>  few  giddy  turns,  was  always</span><span>  dumped  somewhere  close  to</span><span>  where  he  started.</span></p> <p><span>  Out  of  these  years  of  for</span><span>  mative  experience  cotton  be</span><span>  came  known  as  the  ""poor</span><span>  man's  crop.""  Being  harvested</span><span>  by  hand,  the  machinery  re</span><span>  quirement*  were  simple  and  oi</span><span>  low  cost.  Indeed  a  brush</span><span>  hook,  axe,  walking-stick  plan</span><span>  ter  and  a  packing  needle  were</span><span>  the  only  requirements  to</span><span>  bring  seed  cotton  to  a  stage</span><span>  ready  fot  dispatch  to  the  gin</span><span>  nery.

Farmers  in  the  Callide</span><span>  and  Dawson  1  Valleys,  and</span><span>  other  districts,  too,  found  it</span><span>  profitable  to  grow  cotton  on  a</span><span>  share  system.  The  farmer</span><span>  isuppUed  virgin  scrub  land,</span><span>  fceed  and  cartage,  while  the</span><span>  share  farmer  felled  and  burn</span><span>  ed  the  scrub,  planted  and</span><span>  picked  the  cotton.

Eire's  Government  has</span></p> <p><span>  made  of  Eire  a  foreign  coua-!</span><span>  try,  and  It  remains  for  the</span><span>  people  of  the  several  British</span><span>  Dominions  to  declare  what</span><span>  their  relevant  laws  have  made</span></p> <p><span>  of  IrUh-born  folk  In  their]</span><span>  midst.  The  problem  is  com</span><span>  plicated  by  the  fact  of  the</span><span>  Irish  people  having  migrated</span><span>  to  many  lands,  and  so  to  have</span><span>  acquitted  themselves  that  they</span><span>  occupy  high  administrative</span><span>  poets  there.  If  by  an  act  of</span><span>  the  Elran  Government  they</span><span>  have  become  foreigners  In  the</span><span>  land  of  their  adoption,  uie</span></p> <p><span>  question  of  which  allegiance  to  j</span><span>  whom  becomes  of  paramount</span></p> <p><span>  importance.  If  tbey  are  mi</span></p> <p><span>  countries  outside  of  the  Brit</span><span>  ish  Commonwealth  of  Nations</span><span>  the  change  of  nationality</span><span>  means  little;  but  If  they  are</span><span>  within  that  group  each  indi</span><span>  vidual  is  at  once  faceÂ£  with</span><span>  a  choice  that  only  he  can</span><span>  make.  From  being  a  British</span><span>  subject  while  living  In,  say</span><span>  Australia,  be  has  by  law  De</span><span>  come  a  foreigner,  and  his  only</span><span>  way  to  recover  his  status  toat</span><span>  he  acquired  on  birth  fcs  a  mat</span><span>  ter  of  course  will  be  through</span><span>  naturalisation.  Then  are</span><span>  about  70,000  Ireland-born  Irish</span><span>  people  In  Australia,  many  of</span><span>  them  In  the  services  and/or</span><span>  professions  who,  prior  to  the</span><span>  18th  Instant  were  British  citi</span><span>  zens  through  birth  within  the</span><span>  British  Empire.  Their  status</span><span>  should  receive  prompt  atten</span><span>  tion,  and  the  Commonwealth</span><span>  Government  should  lose  no</span></p> <p><span>  time  clarifying  the  position.  It</span></p> <p><span>  is  no  more  tbe  fault  of  Aus</span></p> <p><span>  tralia  than  it  is  of  these  folk</span><span>  that  they  have  been  turned</span><span>  Into  foreigners  by  an  act  of</span><span>  the  Government  of  the  land  of</span><span>  their  birth;  but  they  can  no</span><span>  more  permit  anyone  else  to  de</span><span>  cide  for  them  to  which  Gov</span><span>  ernment  they  will  give  their</span><span>  allegiance  than  Canberra  may</span><span>  Ignore  tbe  many  complications</span><span>  that  are  showing  up.</span></p> <p><span>  BLACKENING  WHITE  AUSTRALIA  POUCY</span></p> <p><span>  TV""Â©  community,  and  very  few  |</span></p> <p><span>  Individuals,  profess  a</span></p> <p><span>  few  of  (he  intrusion  of  col-  I</span><span>  owed  peoples  to  tbe  point  of  i</span><span>  creating  a  problem,  either  ecn-!</span><span>  nomle  or  racial.

In</span><span>  most  Australian  communities</span><span>  tbe  coloured  person  is  suffici</span><span>  ently  rare  to  be  almost  a  curi</span><span>  oflty-much  more  so  than</span><span>  was  the  ease  40  yeejp  ago:</span><span>  when  there  was  a  considerable</span><span>  Chinese  colony  and  a  residue</span><span>  of  the  Island  labour  recruited</span><span>  for  the  caneflelds.  The  Com</span><span>  munist  menace  fomented  by</span><span>  traitorous  whites  Is  a  much</span><span>  more  serious  thought  to  Aus</span><span>  tralians  than  Is  that  of  a  pos</span><span>  sible  racial  problem.

It  was  so  ""slmpNf  to</span><span>  ensure  that  the  ship  was  shortr</span><span>  manned,  and  therefore  could</span><span>  not  sail,  that  it  .grew  and</span><span>  reached  its  greatest  height  of</span><span>  absurdity  last  year  in  the</span><span>  famous  voyage  of  sÂ£.  lime,</span><span>  which  left  Melbourne  early  in</span><span>  December  and  -made  Rock</span><span>  hamptcwi  towards  the  end  of</span><span>  January.</span></p> <p><span>  From  single  vessels  the  spirit</span><span>  ,  of  Christmas  seems  this  year</span></p> <p><span>  to  have  assailed  the  1  whole</span><span>  mercantile  fleet  at  a  very  early</span><span>  date.

Indeed</span><span>  a  ludicrous  position'exists,  in</span><span>  that  members  of  crews  willing</span><span>  to  sail  are  actually  being  paid</span><span>  off  by  owners  ^because  of  in</span><span>  ability  to  make  up.  the  com</span><span>  plement  whilst  the  laden  ves</span><span>  sel5  are  lying  at  the  wharves.</span><span>  Surely  this  is  without  parallel</span><span>  In  the  annals  of  the  Australian</span><span>  shipping  industry,  unless  one</span></p> <p><span>  'goes  back  to  the  time  of  thej</span><span>  early  gold  rushes.  1</span></p> <p><span>  Last  Friday  (December  9),</span></p> <p><span>  seamen  who  refused  to  man!</span><span>  coastal  vessels  were  Warned  by</span></p> <p><span>  the  Maritime  Industry  Com-  j</span></p> <p><span>  mission  that  they  ""might  lose</span></p> <p><span>  their  jobs.""

Whilst</span><span>  the  steps  for  these  deporta</span><span>  tions  were  being  launched</span><span>  there  appeared  a  significant</span><span>  commentary  on  Australia'*,</span><span>  position  and  safety  by  a  world</span><span>  authority  on  population.</span></p> <p><span>  ,  Dr  Warren  Thompson,  USA.</span><span>  who  is  attached  to  General</span><span>  Mac  Arthur's  natural  resources</span><span>  *ectlon,  Is  of  the  opinion  that</span><span>  Australia  may  expect  to  hold</span><span>  New  Guinea  and  her  other</span><span>  unpopulated  inlands  for  ao</span><span>  more  than  a  further  25  years</span><span>  in  the  face  of  growing  Asian</span><span>  population.

With  every  ingredient</span><span>  essential  to  local  manufacture</span><span>  we  are  importing  cement  at</span><span>  many  times  the  cost  at  which</span><span>  It  should  be  produced  her?.</span><span>  Having  proved  conclusively</span><span>  that  we  can  manufacture  steel</span><span>  at  lower  cost  than  any  other</span><span>  country  we  are  now  bringing</span><span>  It  In  from  outside  at  tremen</span><span>  dously  higher  cost  to  avoid</span><span>  public  works  coming  to  a</span><span>  standstill.  These  things  arc</span><span>  directly  traceable  to  the  re</span><span>  duced  working  week  and  to</span><span>  the  reduced  output  per  man</span></p> <p><span>  hour.</span></p> <p><span>  So  far,  Australia  has  readi</span><span>  ed  the  point  Where  only  coal,</span><span>  steel,  cement  and  timber  must</span><span>  be  Imported.  A  stage  further</span><span>  can  be  yet  reached,  and  the</span><span>  first  to  achieve  It  are  the</span><span>  wireworkers  at  Newcastle.  It  is</span><span>  almost  too  fantastic  to  have  to</span><span>  rejate  that  the  employees  in</span><span>  this  Industry  are  only  partly</span><span>  employed,  in  view  of  Austra</span><span>  lia's  position  in  respect  to  wire</span><span>  supplies.  Yet  such  is  the  case,</span><span>  In  their  predicament  the  wire</span><span>  workers  have  protested  to  the</span><span>  governments  against  the  Im</span><span>  portation  from  America  of</span><span>  2100,000  worth  of  rabbit  proof</span><span>  netting.  This  Â£100,000  will  buy</span></p> <p><span>  leu  than  1000  miles  pf  netting,</span><span>  whereas  Australia  needs  300,</span><span>  000  miles!  In  1B39  the  Com</span><span>  monwealth  produced  250  miles</span><span>  of  wire  netting  a  week;  now</span><span>  production  is  down  to  less</span><span>  than  100  miles  per  week.  We</span><span>  are  forced  to  buy  in  America</span><span>  and  Europe  because  local  out</span><span>  put  cannot  meet  the  demand.</span><span>  The  demand  cannot  be  met</span><span>  locally  because  rod  steel  is</span><span>  scarce,  and  rod  steel  is  scarce</span><span>  because  coal  supplies  do  not</span><span>  meet  the  nation's  demand.</span></p> <p><span>  The  wire  workers  ask  that</span><span>  the  importations  of  rabbit</span><span>  proof  netting  be  stopped.  Pas</span><span>  toralists  and  agricultural  and</span><span>  stock  expert#  declare  that  un</span><span>  less  they  can  renew  their  net</span><span>  ting  the  pastoral  industry  will</span><span>  go  under  to  the  rabbit.  What  the</span><span>  wire  workers  should  be  doing  is</span><span>  to  get  their  fellow  unionists  to</span><span>  produce  more  coal  and  steel,</span><span>  otherwise  what  is  happening</span><span>  to  them  today  will  happen  to</span><span>  those  employed  in  other  in</span><span>  dustries  tomorrow.  The  ques</span><span>  tion  is  how  far  must  we  drift</span><span>  before  there  is  an  all-out  cam</span><span>  paign  to  bring  these  things</span><span>  home  to  the  people  of  Austra</span><span>  lia.  They  are  learning  by  the</span><span>  hard  way  what  shorter  hours</span><span>  and  lower  production  means  to</span><span>  their  dinner  table.  It  Is  only  a</span><span>  matter  of  time  when  it  must</span><span>  catch,  up  with  them  in  their</span><span>  jobs.  If  Australia  imbibed</span><span>  these  lessons  and  acted  on</span><span>  them  this  would  indeed  be  a</span><span>  vital  year  in  our  progress  to</span><span>  wards  nationhood.</span></p> ",Article,1949-02-10,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD Rockhampton THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 10 HOW TO MAKE NEIGHBOURS UNFRIENDLY",76177868,3,3,"{'score': '7650.095', 'value': 'very relevant'}",THE administration of our immigration laws in the case of the O'Keefe deportations has started something that,"{'id': '187', 'value': 'The Central Queensland Herald (Rockhampton, Qld. : 1930 - 1956)'}",https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/76177868?searchTerm=%27The+Central+Queensland+Herald%27,/newspaper/76177868,"The Central Queensland Herald (Rockhampton, Qld. : 1930 - 1956)",187

A  warn-1</span><span>  liig.  note  is  struck  by  the</span><span>  Katlonal  Bank  of  Australia  In</span><span>  Its  monthly  commentary.  Capi</span><span>  tal  expenditure  on  projects  al</span><span>  mdy  commenced  need  not</span><span>  necessarily  be  curtailed,  since</span><span>  many  of  them  are  well  ad</span><span>  vanced  and  founded  on  real</span><span>  needs.

In  order  to  eat</span><span>  wisely  wis  must  know  which</span><span>  foods  are  essential  for  normal</span><span>  health  and  growth,  which</span><span>  groups  of  foods  are  equivalent,</span><span>  so  that  they  can  be  substituted</span></p> <p><span>  one  for  another  in  the  inter</span><span>  ests  of  variety,  and  what  quan</span><span>  tities  of  each  are  needed  by</span><span>  persons  in  different  age  groups</span><span>  and  engaged  in  different  kinds</span></p> <p><span>  of  work.</span></p> <p><span>  Hence  the  need  for  more  die</span><span>  titians.

It  was  unsuccessfully</span><span>  challenged  by  the  Government</span><span>  of  Victoria,  and  the  feeling  -</span><span>  reinforced  by  a  tactless  claim</span><span>  by  the  Federal  Treasurer  -</span><span>  is  that  its  operation  will  be</span></p> <p><span>  permanent,  as  so  many  things</span><span>  have  happened  since  the</span><span>  shooting  oeased  that  few</span><span>  people  realise  that,  technically,</span><span>  the  war  is  still  on.

The  Commonwealth's</span><span>  population  at  January,  1949,</span><span>  was  Â«sUmated  at  7,710.110,</span><span>  so  that  the  7,710  doctors  regis</span><span>  tered  In  the  various  8tates</span><span>  work  out  at  the  desired  ratio.</span><span>  Assuming  last  year's  popula</span><span>  tion  Increase  of  130,871  to  be</span><span>  maintained  or  increased  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  next  10  years,  the  population</span><span>  of  Australia  at  the  end  of  that</span><span>  period  will  be  9,000,000,  re</span><span>  quiring  9000  doctors.</span></p> <p><span>  How  many  medical  schools</span><span>  will  be  required  to  satisfy  re</span><span>  placements  when  the  popula</span><span>  tion  reaches  that  figure?  Ac</span><span>  cording  to  the  highest  British</span></p> <p><span>  authorities,  one  medical  school</span><span>  to  approximately  2,250,000  of</span><span>  the  population  is  the  ideal</span><span>  standard.  There  are  at  pre</span><span>  sent  four  medical  schools  (n</span><span>  Australia-Sydney,  Melbourne,</span><span>  Adelaide  and  Bhsbane-and</span><span>  Western  Australia  and  Tas</span><span>  mania  are  each  proposing  to  es</span><span>  tablish  one.  Dr  Schllnk  it</span><span>  strongly  of  opinion  that  addi</span><span>  tional  schools  tihould  not  be  con</span><span>  templated  until  the  population</span><span>  reaches  the  94)00,000  mare.</span><span>  British  medical  authorities  lay</span><span>  down  a  maximum  standard  of</span><span>  one  medical  student  to  23,000</span><span>  of  population.  On  that  basis</span><span>  Australia's  9,000,000  people</span><span>  would  require  387  to  400  stu</span><span>  dents  distributed  over  the  four</span><span>  existing  medical  schools.  How</span><span>  should  they  be  apportioned?</span><span>  Already  there  is  overcrowding,</span><span>  especially  at  the  Sydney  school.</span><span>  On  the  present  population  the</span><span>  distribution  of  students  should</span><span>  be:  Sydney  130,  Melbourne  108,</span><span>  Brisbane  42,  Adelaide  20;  and</span><span>  in  1969  the  respective  figures</span><span>  should  be:  Sydney  176,  Mel</span><span>  bourne  140,  Brisbane  55  and</span><span>  Adelaide  30.</span></p> <p><span>  It  has  been  suggested,  ob</span><span>  serves  Dr  Schllnk,  that  the</span></p> <p><span>  flooding  of  the  profession  has  1</span><span>  been  designedly  brought  about  1</span><span>  in  the  interests  of  the  Fed-  1</span><span>  eral  Government's  contem-  &lt;</span><span>  plated  scheme  of  socialisation</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  medical  profession;  but  '</span><span>  a  more  obvious  reason  Is  the  &lt;</span><span>  ignorance  and  lack  of  actual  1</span><span>  study  of  a  problem  which,  if  i</span><span>  wisdom  prevailed,'should  have  &lt;</span><span>  been  left  to  the  faculty  deans  :</span><span>  of  the  various  universities.</span><span>  Still,  the  modern  habit  is  tot</span><span>  powerful  unions  to  take  over</span><span>  foreign,  policy  and  politicians,</span><span>  legal  luminaries,  big  business</span><span>  and  union  secretaries  to  direct</span><span>  the  medical  profession.</span></p> <p><span>  HIGH  COST  OF  SICKNESS  IN  INDUSTRY</span></p> <p><span>  rTHE  general  impression  is</span></p> <p><span>  that,  notwithstanding  free</span><span>  medicine  schemes  and  the  like,</span><span>  Australia  is,  on  the  whole,  a</span><span>  very  healthy  country  and  ex</span><span>  cepting  for  the  periodical  in</span><span>  fluenza  epidemics,  which  de</span><span>  plete  staffs  for  a  time,  the  loss</span><span>  to  industry  on  account  of  ill</span><span>  ness  is  negligible.  Consequently</span><span>  it  must  come  as  a  surprise  to</span><span>  learn  from  such  a  reliable</span><span>  authority  as  the  bulletin  of</span><span>  the  Queensland  Bureau  of  In</span><span>  dustry  that  Australia  lost</span><span>  about  Â£40,000,000  from  sickness</span><span>  during  1648.  an  amount  that</span><span>  represents  2}  per  cent  of  the</span><span>  national  Income.</span></p> <p><span>  An  investigation  into  the</span><span>  nature  of  the  sicknesses  which</span><span>  occasioned  this  considerable</span><span>  loss  reveals  that,  for  the  most</span><span>  part,  minor  ailments  are  the</span><span>  chief  contributing  cause.  A</span><span>  high  production  loss  is  caused</span><span>  by  illnesses  which  are  not  ser</span><span>  ious  enough  to  cause  incapac</span><span>  ity,  and  this  has  raised  the</span><span>  question  of  the  necessity  of  an</span><span>  all-out  drive  to  minimise  the</span><span>  incidence  of  minor  ailments.  To</span><span>  achieve  this  it  is  considered</span><span>  that  nursing  and  medical  at</span><span>  tention  on  the  spot  would  p'ay</span><span>  a  very  big  part  in  saving  the</span></p> <p><span>  national  loss.  I</span></p> <p><span>  The  influence  of  health  on</span><span>  industry  is  a  condition  that  is</span><span>  not,  of  course,  peculiar  to  Aus</span><span>  tralia.  It  affects  other  indus</span><span>  trial  countries  and  has  invited</span><span>  similar  investigation  as  to</span><span>  causes  and  remedial  measures.</span><span>  A  recent  survey  of  sickness  in</span><span>  England  and  Wales  revealed</span><span>  some  interesting  points.  The</span><span>  survey  showed  that  the  inci</span><span>  dence  of  sickness  increased</span><span>  with  age.  and  is  greater  for</span><span>  females  than  for  males.  The</span><span>  risk  of  injury  falls  with  age</span><span>  for  males,  and  for  females  falls</span><span>  to  a  minimum  at  ages  between</span><span>  35  and  44,  and  then  rises</span><span>  steeply.  Despite  the  greater</span><span>  number  of  Illnesses,  the  days</span><span>  of  Incapacity  per  illness  for</span><span>  females  Is  lower  than  for  males,</span><span>  particularly  at  ages  between  25</span><span>  and  64.  This  is  a  reflection  of</span><span>  the  fact  that  incapacity  for</span><span>  males  and  for  young  women</span><span>  means  absence  from  work,</span></p> <p><span>  while  for  housewives  it  means  ?</span><span>  being  confined  to  bed.  Higher  ,</span><span>  figures  for  incapacity  and  con-  ,</span><span>  sultatlons  per  Illness  for  the  ,</span><span>  16-24  age  group  suggest  that  ;</span><span>  young  people  have  fewer  minor  ,</span><span>  ailments,  and  the  smaller  num</span><span>  ber  of  total  ailments  recorded</span><span>  contains  a  higher  proportion  of</span><span>  more  serious  illnesses.</span></p> <p><span>  LIBERAL-CP  MEN  FIX  BATTLEFIELDS</span></p> <p><span>  rJTHE  Liberal-Country  Party</span></p> <p><span>  election  agreement  is  of</span><span>  special  interest  to  Central</span><span>  Queensland  voters,  in  that  it</span><span>  clears  the  air  concerning  the</span><span>  electorates  of  Capricornia  and</span><span>  Dawson.  Common  sense  has</span><span>  pre%'ailed  in  allocating  one</span><span>  each  to  Liberals  and  Country</span><span>  Party.  Mr  Davidson,  sitting</span><span>  member  fof  Capricornia,  re</span><span>  tains  his  party  affiliation  and</span><span>  about  11,000  Capricornia  voters</span><span>  by  accepting  the  Dawson  nom</span><span>  ination.  As  his  own  farming</span><span>  interests  also  reside  in  the</span><span>  electorate  he  should  win  the</span><span>  new  seat  for  the  Country</span><span>  Party.  What  remains  of  old</span><span>  Capricornia  should  be  won  by</span><span>  the  Liberals,  since  the  consid</span><span>  erable  number  of  voters  who</span><span>  Indicated  their  desire  for  a</span><span>  change  of  Government  at  the</span><span>  last  election  are  likely  to  be</span><span>  added  to  ifrther  than  dimim</span><span>  Ished.  to  ensure  that  result.</span></p> <p><span>  it  Is  imperative  that  the  great</span><span>  est  possible  care  be  taken  in</span><span>  the  selection  of  a  suitable  can</span><span>  didate,  one  who  is  known  and</span><span>  will  command  a  solid  vote  in</span><span>  all  the  main  centres.  Caprl</span><span>  cornia  is  now  a  compact  area</span><span>  which  can  be  completely  cov</span><span>  ered  in  an  active,  well  con</span><span>  ducted  campaign.</span></p> <p><span>  It  is  highly  gratifying  that</span><span>  agreement  has  been  reached</span><span>  in  ample  time  to  permit  can</span><span>  didates  '.and  organisations</span><span>  thoroughly  to  organise  their</span><span>  electorates.  The  Federal  elec</span><span>  tion  is  not  expected  before  De</span><span>  cember.  To  hold  it  earlier</span><span>  would  be  advantageous  to  the</span><span>  Government  in  some  respects,</span><span>  but  it  would  not  give  time  for</span><span>  the  taxation  cuts  and  social</span><span>  benefits  to  show  tnelr  full  ef</span><span>  fects,  and  it  is  a  well-recog</span><span>  nised  political  axiom  that  the</span><span>  events  of  the  last  nine  months</span><span>  in  the  life  of  a  Parliament</span></p> <p><span>  r</span></p> <p><span>  count  most  in  determining  the</span><span>  result  of  an  election.</span></p> <p><span>  Whilst  the  outcome  of  Lib</span><span>  eral-Country  Party  differences</span><span>  in  Queensland  is  a  happy  one,</span><span>  the  necessity  remains  for  simi</span><span>  lar  adjustments  elsewhere.  A</span><span>  complete  merger  is  being</span><span>  aimed  at  in  Victoria.

There  are</span><span>  some  incidents  recorded  in</span><span>  pioneer  history  that  we  would</span><span>  like  to  forget,  though  the  cir</span><span>  cumstances  of  the  time  can  be</span><span>  advanced  in  extenuation  No</span><span>  where  is  the  story  of  colonisa</span><span>  tion  one  of  peaceful  penetra</span><span>  tion  with  happiness  and  con</span><span>  tentment  for  all  parties.  We</span><span>  had  almost  begun  to  think</span><span>  however,  we  had  lived  down</span><span>  the  less  glamorous  chapters  of</span><span>  our  dealings  with  the  original</span><span>  owners  of  Australia,  and  made</span><span>  considerable  amends  in  present</span><span>  policies  and  administration  of</span><span>  native  affairs.  But  every  once</span><span>  in  a  while  there  comes  a  sharp</span><span>  reminder  that  little  ground  for</span><span>  complacency  exists.  One  such</span><span>  occasion  was  the  recent  airing</span><span>  of  complaints,  before  UNO,  of</span><span>  the  Commonwealth's  handling</span><span>  of  the  New  Guinea  m-ndate  in</span><span>  so  far  as  it  affected  the  native</span></p> <p><span>  population.  |</span></p> <p><span>  Striking  nearer  home  Harold</span><span>  Blair,  aboriginal  '  singer,  ad</span></p> <p><span>  ministers  another  mild  shock.</span><span>  On  his  arrival  in  New  York</span><span>  whither  he  was  enabled  to  go</span><span>  largely  ttirottgh  the  Interest  of</span><span>  an  American  singer  who  recog</span><span>  nised  his  gifts-he  gave  a</span><span>  Press  conference.

As  a  fact,j</span><span>  when  Mr  Blair  has  had  time</span><span>  to  examine  his  present  ""new</span><span>  world""  more  closely  he  Willi</span><span>  find  perhaps  from  unhappy  I</span><span>  experience,  how  rigidly  the  j</span><span>  colour  line  can  be  enforced  in</span><span>  USA.  If  his  theatrical  travels</span></p> <p><span>  should  later  take  him  to  South  I</span><span>  Africa,  with  the  Malan  regime  j</span><span>  still  holding  sway,  he  will  re</span><span>  ceive  further  enlightenment  on/</span><span>  this  head  -  sufficient  to  fill</span><span>  him  with  nostalgic  yearning</span><span>  for  the  treatment  of  natives</span><span>  In  his  homeland.</span></p> <p><span>  Nevertheless  the  interview</span><span>  does  question  whether  suffic</span><span>  ient  attention  is  given  to  fos</span><span>  tering  the  uplift  of  the  abor</span><span>  iginal  and  half  caste  popula</span><span>  tion  to  the  extent  that  is  pos</span><span>  sible.

To  ensure  that  the</span><span>  country  shall  be  made  safe</span><span>  against  a  potential  Invader  it</span><span>  feel*  that  It  must  commence</span><span>  Immediately  the  Snowy  River</span><span>  hydro-electric  scheme  and  to</span><span>  establish  the  Commonwealth</span><span>  shipping  line,  both  costly  pro</span><span>  jects  of  questionable  economic</span></p> <p><span>  value.</span></p> <p><span>  Bo  anxious  Is  the  Caucus  to</span><span>  ""get  cracking""  with  the  Snowy</span><span>  River  scheme  that  it  waved</span><span>  aside  the  counsel  of  some  Min</span><span>  isters  to  hasten  slowly,  and  it</span><span>  cannot  wait  for  an  agreement</span><span>  on  the  question  of  control  be</span><span>  tween  the  Commonwealth  and</span><span>  Interested  States.

Yet  the</span><span>  obvious  point  about  such  a</span><span>  scheme,  which  incidentally,  on</span><span>  present  estimates,  will  cost</span><span>  Â£168,000,000,  Is  that  control</span><span>  should  reside  In  Che  hands  of</span><span>  a  national  authority  similar  to</span><span>  that  of  the  famous  TVA  of  the</span><span>  Vtatfcrt  State*.

Xt  may</span><span>  be  a  tfieer  coincidence  that</span><span>  this  Is  Federal  election  year,</span><span>  and  that  many  of  the  redraft</span><span>  ed  electorates  in  tttt  key  States</span><span>  of  NSW  and  Victoria  are  af</span></p> <p><span>  fected  by  the  scheme.

The  cost  of  such  wharf  and</span><span>  railway  connexions,  and  two</span><span>  10-ton.  loading  travelling</span><span>  cranes  would  be  approximately</span></p> <p><span>  Â£79,660.</span></p> <p><span>  4.  Storage  of  coal  to  enable</span><span>  colliers  to  be  continuously</span><span>  loaded  would  be  met  by  the</span><span>  provision  of  parking  space  and</span><span>  extra  supply  of  hopper  wagons.</span><span>  The  cost  of  these  extra  wag</span><span>  ons  might  be  distributed  be</span><span>  tween  other  adjacent  hwuting</span><span>  ports  and  the  Railway  Depart</span><span>  ment.

The  cost  of  providing  stor</span><span>  Â®ge  to  Inns  for  a  similar  quan</span><span>  tity  would  be  approximately</span><span>  Â£46,400.  This  method  Involves</span><span>  extra  handling  of  coal,  with</span><span>  increased  railway  charges.</span></p> <p><span>  6.  The  annual  fixed  charges</span><span>  for  working  expenses  and  in</span><span>  terest  cannot  be  detlrmlned</span><span>  at  present.
