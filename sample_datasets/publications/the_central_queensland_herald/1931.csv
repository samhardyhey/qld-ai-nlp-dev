The  re</span><span>  turns  are  estimated  to  average  f.bout</span><span>  sevenpence  per  pound,  which  means  that</span><span>  they  have  dropped  to  the  same  level</span><span>  a.  they  had  reached  at  the  worst  period</span><span>  during  last  season's  offerings  ;  but,,</span><span>  after  allowing  for  the  existing  ex</span><span>  change  benefit  of  thirty  per  cent.,  they</span><span>  liave  actually  dropped  below  the  pre</span><span>  vious  lowest  level  to  that  extent.</span><span>  It  must  be  admitted  that  the  posi</span><span>  tion  from  the  producer's  point  of  view</span><span>  is  serious,  as  very  few  wool  growers</span><span>  ran  make  headway  under  such  condi</span><span>  tions  and  the  consuming  countries  over</span><span>  8cas  are  financially  disturbed  to  sucu</span><span>  »n  extent  that  there  is  no  prospect  of</span><span>  .nv  early  recovery.  The  AystraHan  level</span><span>  of  'wool  prices  is  governed  wholly  by</span><span>  world  conditions,  and  while  the  con</span><span>  suming  centres  are  depressed  the  pro</span><span>  ducers  must  be  affected  similarly.

At  the  moment,  the  only</span><span>  bright  spot  is  the  maintenance  of  the</span><span>  Japanese  operations,  the  explanation</span><span>  being  that  they  have  been  enlarging</span><span>  tHeir  factories  in  an  endeavour  to  ex</span><span>  pand  their  business  activities.  Tins</span><span>  will  mean  even  greater  wool  purchase*</span><span>  by  Japan  during  the  current  season,  but</span><span>  it  must  be  renumbered  that  a  great</span><span>  rfeal  of  this  new  trade  has  been  won</span><span>  from  European  nations,  so  that  tlio</span><span>  growth  of  Japanese  trade  is  not  addi</span><span>  tional  business  for  the  Commonwealth,</span><span>  v..4.  -nfhn.-  a.  transference  of  demand</span></p> <p><span>  from  European  nations  to  Japan.

To  some  ex</span><span>  tent  an  appreciation  of  this  fact  was</span><span>  iiBtrumental  in  inducing  growcra  to</span><span>  meet  the  uiarkcj,  for  the  belief  that</span><span>  any  artificial  restriction  of  prices  would</span><span>  merely  pjay  into  tho  hands  of  the  arti</span><span>  ficial  fibre  manufacturers  was  wide</span><span>  spread.

This  was  the  result  of</span><span>  c  .....</span></p> <p><span>  over-capitalisation  and  over-production</span><span>  which  had  been  induced  by  the  high</span><span>  wool  prices  of  the  period  from  1923  —</span><span>  192S,  during  which  time  the  world  out</span><span>  put  of  rayon  grew  from  187,500,000  lbs.</span><span>  to  442,200,000  lbs.;  but  there  has  beeu</span><span>  a  marked  difference  during  the  last</span><span>  two  years,  for  already  production  lias</span><span>  fallen  away  considerably.</span><span>  Pastoralists  should  realise  that  while</span><span>  the  period  of  depression  has  seen  the</span><span>  falling  away  of  their  artificial  fibre</span><span>  rivals,  the  period  of  recovery  which</span><span>  muEt  commence  in  the  near  future  will</span><span>  just  as  surely  see  their  revival,  and</span><span>  no  stone  can  be  left  unturned  to  meet</span><span>  their  competition.  Wool  growers  have</span><span>  been  too  prone  to  rely  upon  the  natu</span><span>  ral  advantages  of  their  product  in  the</span><span>  past,  and  it  is  probable  that  if  they</span><span>  had  gone  to  the  same  trouble  and  ex</span><span>  periments  to  maintain  their  trade  that</span><span>  the  artificial  manufacturers  went  to  to</span><span>  gain  a  foothold  the  artificial  articles</span><span>  would  never  have  gained  the  popularity</span><span>  and  prominence  they  did.

Unlike  many  public  meetings,</span><span>  -these  two  had  the  simple  virtue  of</span><span>  knowing  what  it  was  they  suffered</span><span>  from,  as  well  as  possessing  some  wry</span><span>  cogent  reasons  for  the  relief  they  con</span><span>  eider  is  their  due.</span><span>  The  ills  from  which  people  in  inland</span><span>  districts  now  suffer  are  deepseated,  and</span><span>  have  been  the  6ubject  of  frequent  com</span><span>  ment  by  us  in  the  past.  On  ths  eve</span><span>  of  a  transport  commission  that  is  to</span><span>  inquire  into  these  matters  a  recapitu</span><span>  lation  of  these  comments-  would  be</span><span>  superfluous,  as  we  are  presenting  a  case</span><span>  to  tfie  commission  in  which  the  mat</span><span>  ter  of  bleeding  the  inland  districts  to</span><span>  feed  the  coast  cities  aid  to  compen</span><span>  sate  for  some  of  the  losses  incurred</span><span>  on  coast  lines  is  fully  developed.

Since  then  the  rates  to</span><span>  and  from  inland  districts  have  been</span><span>  doubled,  and  the  western  pioneers  pay</span><span>  their  share  in  taxation  to  meet  Uie</span><span>  colossal  losses  that  the  railways  liuvc</span><span>  piled  up..  The  excuse  is  that  operat</span><span>  ing  costs  have  soared,  which  (suggests</span><span>  that  those  of  the  pastoialisU  btood</span><span>  ?till.  It  also  discounts  such  u  fac</span><span>  tor  as  prices  for  pastoral  products,  a</span><span>  factor  that  docs  not  disturb  the</span><span>  railways.  PastoralisU  have  had.  to</span><span>  face  increased  cotts  and  decreased</span><span>  prices,  while  the  railway**  have  had  to</span><span>  face  only  the  former.  We  thus  have</span><span>  the  Commissioner  for  Railways  claim</span><span>  ing  '  a  special  dispensation  for  the  stag</span><span>  gering  performance  of  the  railways</span><span>  because,  as  'a  means  of  developing  the</span><span>  country,'  they  should  be  exempt  from</span><span>  being  regarded  as  commercial  under</span><span>  takings.  On  page  20  of  the  same  re</span><span>  port  he  quotes  Professbr  Copland,'  in</span><span>  ?upport  of  'writing  down'  railway</span><span>  capital,  as  having  the  management  of</span><span>  yie  railways  'as  a  business  concern'</span><span>  *s  its  objective.  There  Eeems  to  be</span><span>  ?cope  here  for  sonic  interpretation  of</span><span>  ftilway  policy,  and  the  forthcoming</span></p> <p><span>  commission  cot?«—  de^worse  service  than'</span><span>  attend  to  it.  '  I</span><span>  Another  point  taken  is  that  the  mere,</span><span>  building  of  railways  enhances  enorm</span><span>  ously  the  value  of  the  adjoining  coun-l</span><span>  try.  This  statement  requires  to  be'</span><span>  taken  in  conjunction  with  the  fact  that</span><span>  there  are  millions  of  acres  of  land  ad</span><span>  joining  railway  lines  that  are  still  in</span><span>  a  state  of  nature  —  and  likely  to  remain</span><span>  so.  The  enhanced  value  claimed  is</span><span>  largely  mythical.  Quality  of  soil,  sur</span><span>  face  and  subterranean  water,  rainfall,</span><span>  market  prices,  and  proximity  to  mar</span><span>  ket,  are  the  principal  factors  in  estab</span><span>  lishing  land  values,  and  hardly  one  of</span><span>  them  plays  a  less  important  part  than</span><span>  does  a  railway  that  develops  from  a</span><span>  public  facility  to  a  public  burden.</span><span>  But  perhaps  the  most  important  fac</span><span>  tor  to  inland  residents  is  the  rating</span><span>  policy  on  goods.  This  is  based  upon</span><span>  the  principle  of  giving  concessions  to</span><span>  residents  in  cities  that  also  are  ports,</span><span>  as  well  as  on  goods  for  export,  and</span><span>  collecting  sufficient  from  inland  resi</span><span>  dents  to  make  up  the  difference.</span><span>  Situated  as  Brisbane  is  with  respect  to</span><span>  many  of  the  primary  producing  centres,</span><span>  the  cost  of  living  there  carries  only  ex</span><span>  port  railway  rates  for  many  commodi</span><span>  ties.  The  same  applies  in  a  lesser  de</span><span>  gree  to  Rocklmnipton.  The  following</span><span>  table  shows  the  amount  payable  on</span><span>  goods  hauled  443  miles  from  point  of</span><span>  production  to  ports  or  Wallangarra,</span><span>  and  on  the  same  goods  if  hauled  443</span><span>  miles  from  Rockhampton  to  Emmet:  —</span><span>  To  ports  Rock</span><span>  or  hamp</span><span>  Conimodity.  l  Wai-  ton  to</span><span>  langarra.

At  most,  the</span><span>  freight  on  such  wool  would  be  five  per,</span><span>  cent  of  the  total  railway  freights  on  all  i</span><span>  wool,  and  25  per  cent  of  five  per  cent,</span><span>  amounts  to  the  princely  sum  of  253.'</span><span>  This  would  leave  the  wool  bill  at  £38</span><span>  15s.  instead  of  £100,  and  is  a  very</span><span>  small  drop  in  a  very  large  bucket.  The</span><span>  reduction  of  2$  per  cent  on  all  wocl</span><span>  freights  will  bring  down  the  bill  by  an</span><span>  other  £1  9s.  5d.,  so  that  the  wool  men</span><span>  will  now  pay  £96  5s,  7d.  where  they]</span><span>  previously  paid  £100.  As  usual,  the.</span><span>  Taxation  Commissioner  is  keeping</span><span>  handy  to  see  that  none  of  the  wool  men</span><span>  become  violently  affluent  through  the</span><span>  microscopic  concession.</span><span>  The  classifications  in  the  new  rates</span><span>  hare  been  reduced  from  nine  to  five,</span><span>  but  the  .exceptions  to  the  general  rates</span><span>  now'  extend  from  page  86  to  125,  in</span><span>  stead  of  from  page  92  to  113  as  here</span><span>  tofore.  The  new  pages  also  are  larger,</span><span>  £o  that  the  new  general  rates  appar</span><span>  ently  are  less  of  a  guide  to  the  actual</span><span>  rates  than  were  the  old1  ones.</span><span>  Mr.  Morgan  said  that  many  'articles</span><span>  classified  as  second-class  at  present</span><span>  would  be  transferred  into  first-class</span><span>  And  carried  at  the  lower  freight  charg</span><span>  ed  upon  first-class  goods.'  fie  should</span><span>  have  mentioned  that  class  3  became</span><span>  ,  class  2,  and  any  goods  which,  previous</span><span>  ly  in  class  2,  remain  in  that  class  really</span><span>  ,  have  undergone  an  increase  in  freight</span><span>  from  76s.  5d.  (old  class  2)  to  1046.  5d.</span><span>  (new  class  2).  Our  analysis  eIiows  that</span><span>  36  articles  were  classified  down  frovn</span><span>  class  2  to  «lass  1,  and  that  the  same</span><span>  number  were  left  in  clasB  2  for  the</span><span>  higher  classification  of  3  to  descend  on</span><span>  ?them.  Taking  one  ton  of  each  article,</span><span>  the  reduced  freight  i6  £35  16s..  while</span><span>  the  increased  freight  on  the  other  lot</span><span>  is  £47  15s.  This,  it  is  to  be  presumed,</span><span>  is  in  the  -  interests  of  State  'develop-</span><span>  ment.'</span><span>  A  subtle  increase  that  should  give</span><span>  another  fillip  to  'development'  comes</span><span>  through  including  the  terminal  charges</span><span>  with  the  freight.  Many  of  the  general</span><span>  rates  are  arrived  at  by  adding  a  per</span><span>  centage  of  the  schedule  rate  to  itself,'</span><span>  as,  for  instance,  class  2  plu6  50  per  cent.</span><span>  In  this  case  the  terminal  rate  also  is</span><span>  Increased  by  50  per  cent.  Our  analysis</span><span>  discloses-  that  from  this  cause  tha</span><span>  freight  will  be  increased  by  an  amount</span><span>  equal  to  the  terminal  rate  in  two  cases,</span><span>  by  50  per  cent  of  it  in  30  cases,  by  25</span><span>  per  cent  of  it  in  ten  cases,  by  20  per</span><span>  cent  of  it  in  ten  cases,  by  15  per  cent</span><span>  of  it  in  seven  cases,  and  by  ten  per</span><span>  cent  of  it  in  50  cases.  The  increase</span><span>  from  iis  source  may  not  be  a  heavy</span><span>  one,  but  it  easily  can  be  more  than  the</span><span>  amount  of  decrease  in  the  wool  freigiit</span><span>  bilL</span></p> <p><span>  Taking  only  the  general  rates,  the</span><span>  traditional  sympathy  of  the  Railway</span><span>  Department  for  inland  pioneers  has</span><span>  been  maintained.  A  table  elsewhere  in</span><span>  thin  issue  shows  that  the  people  who</span><span>  live  inland  are  paying  110  per  cent  more</span><span>  to  have  one  ton  each  of  fourteen  ar</span><span>  ticles  carried  100  miles  .than  is  paid</span><span>  w.Vere  such  article*  are  consigned  'to</span><span>  poirts.'

According  to  an  old</span><span>  saw,  he  reaps  indigestion  who  sows  in</span><span>  a  hurry,  while  another  allies  anger  with</span><span>  haste  in  the  destruction  of  good  counsel.</span><span>  This  somehow  describes  the  Australian</span><span>  sentiment  which  brought  us  to  the  con</span></p> <p><span>  dition  where  our  debts  are  almost  equal  ri</span><span>  to  the  total  value  of  gold  and  all  other  r</span><span>  minerals  won  in  Australia  since  her  jti</span><span>  discovery,  and  still  is  urging  Us  to;n</span><span>  hasten  to  the  bankruptcy  court.  jb</span><span>  The  latest  suggestion  that  Australia  n</span><span>  is  not  moving  with  sufficient  celerity  it]</span><span>  comes  from  Mr.  Kingsford  Smith  with  a</span><span>  respect  to  a  subsidy  for  an  air-mail  be*  n</span><span>  tween  Brisbane  and  Sydney  and  Sydney  vi</span><span>  and  Melbourne.  He  said  :  «</span><span>  'We  are  losing  money  every  day.</span><span>  With  a  Government  subsidy  the  com-  °</span><span>  pany  would  make  aerial  travel  as,o</span><span>  cheap  as  travel  bv  train,  but  until  the  f</span><span>  Government  assists  nothing  can  be'</span><span>  done.'  l0</span><span>  The  substance  of  this  quaint  claim  is  vt</span><span>  that  provided  the  public  can  be  e</span><span>  sufficiently  raided,  Mr.  Smith's  aerial  h</span><span>  company  could  compete  with  profit  a</span><span>  against  the  railways  which  belong—  ,t</span><span>  nominally  at  least—  to  the  people.  But  '</span><span>  the  people  also  are  subsidising  their  *</span><span>  railways  to  a  colossal  extent,  as  well  --</span><span>  ?s  paying  the  highest  railway  rates  on</span><span>  earth.  Mr.  Smith's  suggestion,  there-  f]</span><span>  fore,  works  out  at  »  '</span><span>  1.  The  people  in  the  severity  of  c</span><span>  railway  charges  subsidise  their  own  ;,</span><span>  concern,  and  have  long  been  buoyed  ^</span><span>  up  with  the  hope  or  expectation  that</span><span>  at  some  dim  and  unspecified  date  the  *</span><span>  railways  will  lean  Usb  heavily,  and  *</span><span>  even  provide  better  service.  e</span><span>  2.  High  railway  rates  and  fares  t</span><span>  notwithstanding,  railway  losses  are'o</span><span>  stupendous  and  are  growing  more  so.  j.</span><span>  The  people  meet  those  losses  and  are</span><span>  urged,  when  they  show  signs  o€|</span><span>  restiveifess,  to  note  the  rapid  march  !v</span><span>  of  development  and  growth  of  in</span><span>  dustry.</span><span>  3.  The  same  people  are  now  asked</span><span>  —  or  it  is  suggested1  that  they  be  asked</span><span>  —to  subsidise  Mr.  Smith's  aerial  mail</span><span>  service  'to  the  end,  presumably,  that</span><span>  railway  traffic  decrease  and  losses</span><span>  grow.  ?  If  the  aerial  subsidy  were</span><span>  sufficiently  large  railway  mail  and</span><span>  pasBetager  traffic  might  diminish  to</span><span>  vanishing  point.  But  the  overhead</span><span>  debt  on  the  railways  would  remain.</span><span>  The  logic  of  Mr.  Smith's  suggestion</span><span>  is  bad,  and  the  d'enwnd  for  additional</span><span>  Iiaste  along  these  mail  routes  has'  not</span><span>  been  demonstrated-  Provided  someone</span><span>  else  can  be  called  upon  to  pay,  there</span><span>  always  will  be  people  who  place  such</span><span>  value  on  their  importance  that  only  the</span><span>  most  costly  form  ^f  transport  is</span><span>  compatible  with  their  dignity.  Yet</span><span>  men  in  the  past  conquered  overwhelm</span><span>  ing  forces  with  a  less  speed  than  a  mile</span><span>  or  more  per  minute  at  their  disposal,</span><span>  and  Julius  Caesar  was  no  less  a  con</span><span>  queror  because  it  took  the  whole  -of  his</span><span>  resources  and1  three  weeks  to  send  a</span><span>  letter  from  barbarian  Britain  to  Im</span><span>  perial  Rome.</span><span>  The  plain  bald  fact  is  that  Australia</span><span>  cannot  afford  even  the  speed  at  which</span><span>  her  trains  t  travel.  That  is  to  Gay,  she</span><span>  has  not  in  the  past  paid  cash  for  «uch</span><span>  speed,  and  the  ability  to  pay  is  not  in</span><span>  creasing.  Last  year  Australia  paid</span><span>  £118,841  in  subsidies  to  aerial  mail  ser</span><span>  vices,  and  got  back  in  fees  only  £16,426.</span><span>  She  paid  for  £6  8s.  worth  of  service  and</span><span>  fot  back  20e.,  although  this  includes</span><span>  back  country  service  where  no  other</span><span>  exists.  But  on  the  Perth-Adelaide  route</span><span>  she  paid  on  mail  matter  Is.  9d.  per  ounce</span><span>  and  received  back  only  3d-,  and  madness</span><span>  of  that  description  is  difficult  of</span><span>  reconciliation  with  any'  but  the  counsels</span><span>  of  Iiaste.</span><span>  A  point  that  has  escaped  notice  in</span><span>  the  general  flurry  for  speed  and  air  joy</span><span>  rides  is  that  every  ounce  of  fuel  con</span><span>  sumed  in  the  air  is  imported.  Up.  to</span><span>  tho  point  where  our  goods  meet  the</span><span>  fuel-bill  there  is  not  much  complaint,</span><span>  but  as  the  United  States  whence  come</span><span>  the  major  portion  of  our  petrol  and</span><span>  other  liquid  fuel  takes  from  us  only</span><span>  i!0s.  of  goods  for  every  120a.  worth  she</span><span>  sells  us,  we  have  either  to  borrow  the</span><span>  balance.  or  else  pay  in  gold.  Against</span><span>  ttus  is  the  fact  that,  with  all  their</span><span>  faults  and  Treird  anomalies,  Australian</span></p> <p><span>  railways  at  least  are  good  customers  for</span><span>  Australian  coal.  Probably  no  hardship</span><span>  in  respect  to  stores  for  carrying  on</span><span>  the  Australian  railways  would1  be  felt</span><span>  if  Australia  were  cut  off  from  the  rest</span><span>  of  the  world  for  an  indefinite  period.</span><span>  This  brings  us  to  the  point  on  which</span><span>  much  propaganda  for  aerial  services  is</span><span>  based.  Although  definitely  pledged  to</span><span>  fight  nobody  who  is  not  another  Aus</span><span>  tralian  trying  to  conduct  an  industry,</span><span>  the  defence  aspect  of  flying  is  being  con</span><span>  tinually  stressed'.  On  much  the  same</span></p> <p><span>  ickety  foundation  disciples  of  horse</span><span>  acing  point  to  the  necessity  for  main</span><span>  lining  the  breed,  though  the  use  of  a</span><span>  arrow-chested  sprinter  in  any  of  the</span><span>  readrand-butter  work  of  the  nation  has</span><span>  ot  yet  been  stated.  The  use  of  all</span><span>  be  aeroplanes  on  earth,  together  with,</span><span>  n  army  of  trained  pilots  and</span><span>  lechanics  would  not  without  petrol  be</span><span>  rorth  a  fleet  of  wheelbarrows.  But</span><span>  ith  an  alert  enemy  patrolling  the  seas,</span><span>  be  job  of  keeping  open  a  line  of  com*</span><span>  lunications  from  Australia  to  America's</span><span>  il  ports  would  need  nothing  less  than</span><span>  wo  British  navies.  And1  if  Australia</span><span>  in  conduct  an  air  war  only  through  the</span><span>  ostly  —  to  them  —  co-operation  of  people</span><span>  rhom  we  have  of  late  done  much  to</span><span>  strange,  we  might  as  well  admit  the</span><span>  ollow  mockery  of  the  business  right</span><span>  way.  There  also  is  the  possibility</span><span>  hat  the  British  navy  would  be  hover</span><span>  lg  off  the  coast  of  New  South  Wales,</span><span>  'hile  a  landing  party  on  shore  was  try*</span><span>  ig  to  collect  a  little  overdue  interest.</span><span>  The  world  of  late  years  has  rested</span><span>  rom  its  worries  from  time  to  time  in</span><span>  rder  to  watch  the  progress  of  some</span><span>  resh  scheme  to  ftV  across  oceans  and</span><span>  lip  another  day  —  or  hour—  from  the  fly</span></p> <p><span>  ng  time  from  England  to  Australia.</span><span>  Fhere  the  fliers  have  fluked'  through</span><span>  here  have  been  hysterical  demonetra</span><span>  ions  of  joy  and  lavish  gifts  of  cash</span><span>  ind  kind  have  poured  out.  Yet  few  of</span><span>  hose  flights  have  proved  anything</span><span>  ther  than  that  luck  is  a  vital  part  of</span><span>  he  equipment.  Also,  unless  the  affairs</span><span>  -f  Britain  and  Australia  would  other</span><span>  rise  have  been  worse,  there  is  nothing</span><span>  o  show  that  their  condition  is  any</span><span>  tetter  through  receiving  mail  matter  in</span><span>  wo  instead  of  in  six  weeks.

For  the  hard*</span><span>  practical  work  which  lies  in  abundance</span><span>  ihead  of  Australia  the  aeroplane  has</span><span>  little  place.  Australia  cannot  afford  the</span><span>  LOO  or  so  miles  per  hour  of  the  aero</span><span>  Dlane.  She  cannot  afford  the  30  or  Bo</span><span>  niles  per  hour  of  her  railways,  and</span><span>  probably  had  a  higher  state  of  well</span><span>  being  when  she  was  contented'  with  her</span><span>  25  or  so  miles  per  day  behind  a  pair</span><span>  if  horses.

By  1852  Vic</span><span>  toria  and!  South  Australia  had  agreed</span><span>  to  the  alteration,  there  being  no  Queens</span><span>  land,  and  Western  Australia  was  get</span><span>  ting  over  its  first  attempts  at  land</span><span>  settlement  and  so  did  not  count  Tas</span><span>  mania  counted  less  then  than  she  does</span><span>  even  now.</span><span>  Another  year  passed  and  brought  a</span><span>  jiew  engineer  to  the  New  South  Bail</span><span>  ways,  whose  first  act  was  to  switch</span><span>  back  to  the  4  ft.

The</span><span>  Government,  as  confident  then  as  Gov</span><span>  ernments  have  been  ever  since  and  are</span><span>  now  in  the  power  of  an  Act  of  Par-  1</span><span>  Jiainent,  passed  in  1853  the  necessary  /</span><span>  Act  to  give  effect  to  the  wishes  of  the</span><span>  uew  engineer.  It  afeo  ignored  both</span><span>  tiie  hot  protests  from  the  other  con</span><span>  tracting  States  against  the  deliberate</span><span>  breach  of  faith,  and  the  solemn  con</span><span>  demnation  of  the  Colonial  Office,  and</span><span>  Went  on  doing-  as  it  liked.  The  other</span><span>  States  did  likewise  and  Queensland,</span><span>  when  she  started  railway  building,  fol</span><span>  lowed  suit  and  chose  another  gauge*</span><span>  In  1853  when  the  blunder  waB  first</span><span>  ,made  there  were  in  the  whole  of  Aus</span><span>  tralia  only  23i  miles  of  railway  line.</span><span>  The  beginning  of  Australian  railway</span><span>  liistory  So  years  ago  is  a  very  reliable</span><span>  index  to  wh.-t  has  followed.  Through</span><span>  all  the  succeeding  years  of  drought  und</span><span>  plenty,  through  terms  of  bad  and  worse</span><span>  Governments,  and  countless  titanic  bat</span><span>  tles  waged  'n  defence  of  the  rights  °*</span><span>  one  Australian  State  against  another</span><span>  [Australian  State,  it  does  not  appear  to</span><span>  have  occurrel  to  any  Government  to</span><span>  appoint  (someone  to  protect  the  Austra</span><span>  lian  citizen  against  the  fearful-  Austra</span><span>  lian  railway  muddle  that  was  accumu</span><span>  lating.  For  piling  up  it  inevitably</span><span>  was,  and  to-day  the  Australian  rail</span><span>  way's  have  become  a  fearful  incubus,</span><span>  the  exact  weight  of  which  no  man</span><span>  knows  or,  for  that  matter,  seems</span><span>  anxious  to  ascertain.  Waste  in  their</span><span>  .circuitous  routes,  waste  in  their  assort</span><span>  ment  of  gauges,  and  waste  in  the  need</span><span>  less  heights  they  climbed  and  the  need1</span><span>  'leas  depths  they  descend.  Hence  it  is</span><span>  that  the  Australian  railways  last  year</span><span>  ilost  £8,210,424,  or  more  than  £158,000</span><span>  per  week,  aud  in  the  last  'ten  years</span><span>  have  lost  au  average  of  £4,096sS51  per</span><span>  annum,  aud  the  whole  of  the  indica</span><span>  tions  are  that  the  losses  have  onlycom</span><span>  ?nicnced.</span><span>  ?  This  stupendous  result  -  has  not  been</span><span>  achieved  without  persistent  effort.  For</span><span>  over  '-a!f  a  century  the  capital  account</span><span>  of  rail  nays  was  a  sink  into  which  all</span><span>  sorts  of  odd's  aud  ends  were  dropped</span><span>  by  odds  and  cuds  of  politicians,  con</span><span>  fident  in  the  belief  that  the  blunders</span><span>  would  .-remain  .  buried  until  the  politi</span><span>  cian  concerned  was  wafted  by  his</span><span>  powers  of  oratory  to  au  even  more  am</span><span>  bitious  destiny.  In  the  last  ten  years</span><span>  the  cost  per  mile  of  open  Hue  in  Aus</span><span>  tralia  has  increased1  by  2i  per  cent,  aud</span><span>  in  the  circumstances  there  is  nothing</span><span>  to  show  where  the  increased  cost  of</span><span>  the  same  miles  of  the  same  line  is  to</span><span>  slop.  Throughout  the  length  and</span><span>  breadth  of  Australia  there  are  decayins</span><span>  bridges  which  have  have  been  aban</span><span>  doned,  corroding  engines  and  other  rol</span><span>  ling  stock  that  have  gone  to  the  scrap</span><span>  heaps,  dust  and  rust  where  once  were</span><span>  solid  assets,  vet  many  of  the  assets  set</span><span>  against  the  increased!  cost  of  Open  !in«</span><span>  are  to  be  found  in  those  long-gone  ar</span><span>  ticles  and  equipment.  .  In  other  words,</span><span>  a  very  large  percentage  of  Australia's</span><span>  railway  debt  has  no  more  eolid  back</span><span>  ing  than  is  to  be  got  from  the  scrap</span><span>  heaps  ,of  the.  several  railway  ..  systems.</span><span>  But.,,  the  debt  remains  and  interest</span><span>  on  it  bus  to  be  paid  each  rear,  a«3  a^</span><span>  ?.  no  povcr.umcAfc  sufficiently  cqurajjqp.u*</span><span>  '  -  lagawam'fii  ?  wmm  ?mfea^.j;  ?  mi—  i  1  1  iegaM</span></p> <p><span>  to  collect  from  users  of  the  railways</span><span>  enough  'to  pay  all  costs  and  charges</span><span>  has  yet  been  found,  the  Bhabby  expe</span><span>  dient  of  collecting  the  balance  from</span><span>  taxpayers  was  invented'.

But</span><span>  the  railway  users  have  not  altogetbor</span><span>  escaped,  as  the  average  amount  collec</span><span>  ted  per  passenger  journey  increased  by</span><span>  3S  per  cent  between  1912  and  1930,  and</span><span>  the  average  amount  collected  per  ton</span><span>  of  goods  by  69  per  cent  in  the  same</span><span>  period.

If  this  could  be  regarded  as</span><span>  a  legitimate  reason,  having  regard  to</span><span>  the  liberality  with  which  nature  has</span><span>  endowed  Australia  with  ports,  there</span><span>  still  remains  the.  concentration  of  Aus</span><span>  tralia's  population  in  the  six  capitals</span><span>  The  percentage  of  Australia's  popula</span><span>  tion  in  the  eix  capitals  was  38.53  in</span><span>  1912  and  is  now  49.28,  eo  that  concen</span><span>  tration  —  one  of  the  first  considerations</span><span>  of  railway  management—  has  been  met.</span><span>  That  the  greater  portion  of  the  hun</span><span>  ger  and  misery  during  the  present  cri</span><span>  sis  exists  also  in  the  sue  capitals  sug</span><span>  gests  that  there  are  considerations  in</span><span>  our  national  life  which  transcend1  even</span><span>  the  requirements  of  so  costly  a  muddle</span><span>  as  that  of  our  railway  system.  .</span></p> ",Article,1931-06-18,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

People  who  know  the  official  work</span><span>  ings  of  these  things,  realise  that  the  re</span><span>  arrangement  of  Federal  electoral  boun</span><span>  daries  is  in  the  hands  of  a  special  elec</span><span>  toral  commission.  Having  regard  to  the</span><span>  persistent  demands  that  filter  up  from</span></p> <p><span>  '  the  south  for  cheaper  sugar,  even  they</span><span>  would  be  disposed  to  regard  Mr.  Forde</span><span>  as  exceptionally  lucky  in  the  almost</span><span>  total  exclusion  of  sugar  from  his  elec</span><span>  torate.  Having  regard  also  to  his  ten</span><span>  der  consideration  for  the  cattleman,  the</span><span>  inclusion  in  his  electorate  of  the  large</span><span>  cattle  areas  to  the  north,  west,  and</span><span>  south-west  from  Clermont  merely  em</span><span>  phasises  his  phenomenal  luck-  in  not</span><span>  having  to  placate  the  excluded  sugar</span><span>  growers  at  Bundaberg,  Childers,  and  ad</span><span>  jacent  areas.  In  the  coming  election</span><span>  appearances  are  that  hide  will  cause  less</span><span>  cmbarassment  than  sugar,  and  by  the</span><span>  rearrangement  of  his  electorate  Mr.</span><span>  Forde  has  been  supplied  with  ample  of</span><span>  the  former  and  relieved  of  the  latter.</span><span>  The  other  indications  of  trouble  ahead</span><span>  of  the  6ugar  industry  go  back  a  num</span><span>  ber  of  years,  and  are  based  mostly  upon</span><span>  the  principle  that  while  the  whole  of</span><span>  Australia  ?  may  with  equity  ba  levied</span><span>  upon  to  protect  southern  industries,  it</span><span>  is  an  unheard  of  iniquity  to  impose  ?</span><span>  similar  levy  to  protect  an  essentially</span><span>  tropical  industry.  For  instance,  New</span><span>  ,  South  Wales  and  Victoria  with  «7  per</span><span>  cent  of  Australia's  toijH  population,</span><span>  produce  83  per  cent  of  the  total  cloth</span><span>  ing,  textiles,  boots,  and  shoes  made</span><span>  in  Australia.  These  are  all  heavily  pro</span><span>  tected  commodities  which  these  States</span><span>  would  be  unable  to  place  without  the</span><span>  markets  offered  in  the*  other  States</span><span>  Queensland  included.  Western  Austra</span><span>  lia,  South  Australia,  and  Tasmania  have</span><span>  each  been  assisted  from  the  funds  of</span><span>  the  Commonwealth  because  of  the  dis</span><span>  abilities  they  have  suffered—  and  still</span><span>  suffer  —  from  the  protectionist  policy  ot</span><span>  thj  Commonwealth,  So  far  Queensland</span><span>  has  not  presented  any  such  claim.  On</span><span>  the  other  hand,  she  has  paid  her  share</span><span>  of  the  relief  granted  to  the  three</span><span>  {States  mentioned.</span><span>  The  latest  charge  against  the  Queens</span><span>  land  sugar  industry  is  that  in  Victoria</span><span>  there  are  'hundreds  of  tons  of  fruit'</span><span>  Totting  owing  to  the.  'exhorbitant  price</span><span>  charged  for  sugar.'  It  was  .a  State</span><span>  Labour  Minister  who  made  the  state</span><span>  ment,  which  perhaps  explains  why  ne</span><span>  is  so  amazingly  misinformed.  One  of</span><span>  the  conditions  of  the  sugar  agreement</span><span>  is  that  sugar  is  made  available  to  ex</span><span>  port  manufacturers  of  preserved  fruits</span><span>  at  world  parity.  That  is  to  say,  they  get</span><span>  their  sugar  supplies  at  what  it  would</span><span>  cost  to  land  sugar  from  overseas  into</span><span>  Victoria.  Few  Australian  industries</span><span>  have  access  to  world  parity  when  buy</span><span>  ing  their  raw  materials,  least  of  alj</span><span>  the  men  who  grow  sugar.  They  have</span><span>  to  pay  high  duties  on  their  tools  and</span><span>  implements,  or  else  pay  high  Austra</span><span>  lian  prices  for  them.  '</span><span>  Another  charge  is  that  the  sugar  in</span><span>  fa.  24  oz.  tin  of  jam  cost  2d.  in  1911,  now</span><span>  costs  4d.  Investigation  by  the  Chief</span><span>  Accountant  of  the  Customs  Department</span><span>  elicited  the'  information  that  the  in</span><span>  creased  cost  for  sugar  was  Id.,  and  not</span><span>  2d.  He  also  found  that  the  selling</span><span>  price  had  increased  5.2d.  per  tin  in  the</span><span>  B&ms  time,  so  that  the  increase  dm</span><span>  to  higher-priced  sugar  was  Id.  per  tin</span><span>  and  the  other  4.2d.  was  made  up  of</span><span>  items  over  which  sugar  had  no  influ</span><span>  ence.  In  the  row  over  the  Id.  the  4.24</span><span>  is  lost  sight  of.</span><span>  A  common  complaint  is  that  in  the</span><span>  sugar  industry  wages  are  'ridiculously</span><span>  excessive,'  and  other  conditions  of  la</span><span>  bour  are  extravagant.  The  facts  are</span><span>  that  wages  and  labour  conditions  in</span><span>  the  sugar  industry  are  determined  and</span><span>  fixed  by  the  Board  of  Trade  and  Arbi</span><span>  tration.  Few  industries  in  Australia</span><span>  are  so  hemmed  in  with  industrial  re</span><span>  strictions  and  compulsions  as  is  the  sugar</span><span>  industry,  so  that  the  complaint  of  sou</span><span>  thern  interests  lies  really  against  the</span><span>  principle  of  fixing  wages  and  conditions</span><span>  by  compulsory  arbitration.  The  sound</span><span>  seas  or  otherwise  of  this  principle  is</span><span>  not  relevant  at  this  juncture^  and  cer</span></p> <p><span>  tainly  cannot  --be  reviewed  only  in  its</span><span>  application  to  the  sugar  industry.</span><span>  On  the  principle  that  any  sort  of  ar</span><span>  gument  is  better  than  none,  the  oppo</span><span>  nents  to  the  sugar  industry  have  raised</span><span>  the  'bounty-fed'  parrot  cry.  Had  they</span><span>  taken  the  trouble  to  ascertain  the</span><span>  facts,  they  would  have  learned  that  up</span><span>  to  1913  the  Government  collected  in</span><span>  excise  duty  £3,589,772.  of  which  amount</span><span>  £897,443  was  handed  back  to  /growers</span><span>  who  complied  with  prescribed  labour</span><span>  conditions.  This,  the  nearest  approach</span><span>  to  a  bounty  in  the  history  of  the  indus</span><span>  try,  works  out  at  a  rebate  of  one</span><span>  fourth  of  excise  -taxation,  conditional</span><span>  upon  the  observance  of  labour  conditions</span><span>  which  probably  absorbed  twice  as  much</span><span>  as  the  rebate.  Subsequent  to  then  the</span><span>  price  of  sugar  has  been  fixed  by  go</span><span>  vernments,  after  lengthy  hearing  of  evi</span><span>  dence  regarding  the  bearing  of  the  in</span><span>  dustry  upon  vital  points  of  Australian</span><span>  national  policy.  -</span><span>  It  is  of  course  early  to  anticipate  the</span><span>  finding  of  the  Sugar  Commission  which</span><span>  recently'  toured  Queensland!  but  the</span><span>  prevailing  belief  is  that  the  bitter  hos</span><span>  tility  of  southern  manufacturers  will</span><span>  not  be  without  effect.  In  Australia</span><span>  noise  and  vehemence  frequently  are  mis</span><span>  taken  for  logic,  and  there  is  little</span><span>  doubt  that  the  Commission  encount</span><span>  ered  much  of  both  in  its  southern  itine</span><span>  rary.  There  seems  little  reason  to  be</span><span>  lieve  that  the  embargo  on  the  impor</span><span>  tation  of  sugar  will  be  removed,  especi</span><span>  ally  after  so  many  new  embargoes  on</span><span>  other  commodities  have  been  imposed.</span><span>  But  there  does  Eeem  to  be  indications</span><span>  that  there  will  be  a  substantial  cut  in</span><span>  the  retail  price,  and  whether  this  will</span><span>  bo  borne  by  the  sugar  growers  or  by</span><span>  the  refiners  is  a  matter  for  speculation.</span><span>  At  this  juncture,  having  regard  ito</span><span>  Labour  sentiment  toward  the  Colonial</span><span>  Sugar  Refining  Co.,  Ltd.  —  or  toward  all</span><span>  large  companies  for  that  matter  —  a  prob</span><span>  able  distribution  of  the  reduction  will</span><span>  be  one-third  to  be  borne  by  the  growers,</span><span>  and  the  balance  by  the  refining  com</span><span>  pany.</span></p> ",Article,1931-02-19,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

For  the  Government  to  initiate</span><span>  Buch  a  move  would  be  the  first  step</span><span>  toward  private  financial  institutions  fol</span><span>  lowing  suit.  The  most  powerful  com</span><span>  petitor  in  the  money  market  would  thus</span><span>  have  voluntarily  obliterated  itself,  and</span><span>  private  institutions  would  be  only  too</span><span>  pleased  to  return  to  a  more  stable  level.</span><span>  The  ScuHin  ?Administration  complains</span><span>  of  the  high  interest  rates,  so  that  it</span><span>  is  onen  to  the  Lvons  followincr  in  reduea</span></p> <p><span>  those  rates  by  an  appeal  to  the  pat</span><span>  riotism  of  the  people.</span><span>  The  statement  of  Mr?  Lyons  in  .  this</span><span>  issue  indicates  that  he  is  not  insensible</span><span>  of  the  vast  opportunity  that  lies  to  his</span><span>  hand.  He  proposes  that  a  rehabilita</span><span>  tion  Government  will  be  the  humble  ser</span><span>  vant  of  the  people,  and  not  their  arro</span><span>  gant  taskmaster.

"<p><span>  I  THE  CENTRAL  QUEENSLAND  HERALD  !</span><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.  j</span><span>  THURSDAY.  MAY  7,  1931.  I</span></p> <p><span>  THE  BUFFALO  FLY.</span></p> <p><span>  It  has  been  officially  reported  that  the</span><span>  buffalo-fly  lias  travelled  a  great  deal</span><span>  further  South  this  year  during  the</span><span>  summer  season,  and  the  cattle  growers</span><span>  of  this  State  have  asked  for  further</span><span>  protection  from  the  menace.  The  Go</span></p> <p><span>  vernment  officials  are  watching  the  de</span><span>  velopments,  and  it  is  likely  that  the</span><span>  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Stock  will</span><span>  vi6it  the  affected  areas  himself  to  obtain</span><span>  first-hand  information,  so  that  those</span><span>  connected  with  the  cattle  industry  may</span><span>  rest  assured  that  the  best  possible</span><span>  course  of  action  will  eventually  be  fol</span><span>  lowed.</span><span>  Certain  measures  have  already  been</span><span>  instituted  Avith  a  view  to  checking  the</span><span>  progress  of  the  fly,  involving  the  gazet</span><span>  ting  of  a  quarantine  area  of  6.000  square</span><span>  miles  in  North-Western  Queensland,</span><span>  which  it  was  hoped  would  constitute  a</span><span>  buffer  area  sufficient  to  stop  its  south</span><span>  ward  progress.  At  the  Eame  time  one</span><span>  of  the  three  customary  crossings  from</span><span>  the  Northern  Territory  was  closed  so</span><span>  that  all  stock  entering  would  have  to</span><span>  pass  either  the  Lake  Nash  or  Camoo</span><span>  weal  crossings,  which,  being  in  low</span><span>  rainfall  areas,  are  not  as  favourable  to</span><span>  breeding.  Experiments  have  proved</span><span>  that  flies  need  a  damp,  humid  atmos</span><span>  phere  for  breeding  effectively,  and  a</span><span>  ?study  of  their  habits  has  shown  that</span><span>  during  the  dry  winter  months  the  pests</span><span>  almost  disappear,  but  with  the  'advent</span><span>  of  the  summer  rainy  season  they  become</span><span>  numerous  again,  and  reach  their  maxi</span><span>  mum  activity  during  January  and  Feb</span><span>  ruary,  when  the  moist  warm  climate  is</span><span>  essentially  suitable.  With  the  approach</span><span>  of  cooler  weather  they  become  less</span><span>  troublesome,  so  that  natural  conditions</span><span>  play  an  important  part  in  controlling</span><span>  their  ravages.  This  has  led  many  people</span><span>  to  believe  that  climatic  conditions  will</span><span>  confine  the  buffalo  flies  to  the  Northern</span><span>  Territory  and  the  North  of  Queensland,</span><span>  and  that  its  southward  progress  will  be</span><span>  definitely  stopped  in  a  very  short  time.</span><span>  Perhaps  this  view  is  correct,  as  the  flies</span><span>  seem  to  be  following  the  path  .previously</span><span>  taken  by  the  cattle  ticks  years  ago;</span><span>  and  without  a  doubt  natural  conditions</span><span>  have  bad  more  to  do  with  the  preven</span><span>  tion  of  the  tick  entering  into  New  South</span><span>  Wales  than  have  any  official  dipping</span><span>  regulations.  Even  in  Queensland  it  has</span><span>  only  been  the  warm  coastal  areas  which</span><span>  iave  suffered,  and  the  balance  of  the</span><span>  State  has  remained  practically  free.  If</span><span>  the  same  i'  '???'  liappens  with  tlie  buffalo</span><span>  fly,  thcr  ?!-'  need  to  worry  about</span><span>  the  dry  -  any  of  the  cooler  por</span><span>  tions  o.  j;  but  as  so  much  of</span><span>  Queensland  ic  situated  in  the  Tropics,</span><span>  it  will  mean  that  a  very  considerable</span><span>  portion  of  the  country  will  be  subject</span><span>  to  invasion,  including  the  important</span><span>  tattle  fattening  belts  down  the  coast.</span><span>  That  the  cattle  industry  of  Queens</span><span>  land  will  suffer  severely  if  the  flics</span><span>  penetrate  to  the  chief  fattening  dis</span><span>  tricts  is  undoubted,  for  in  the  summer</span><span>  season  their  attacks  upon  stock  are  so</span><span>  6evere  that  it  is  almost  impossible  to</span></p> <p><span>  fatten  at  all,'  and  in  the  case  of  dairy</span><span>  cows  the  milk  output  is  so  materially</span><span>  reduced  that  operations  become  un</span><span>  profitable.  It  is  therefore  important</span><span>  that  control  in  sonic  form  or  other  be</span><span>  instituted.  So  far  the  only  actual  plan</span><span>  to  check  the  flies  has  been  to  create</span><span>  the  buffer  area  in  the  North-west,  but</span><span>  the  Council  of  Scientific  and  Industrial</span><span>  Control  has  had  the  matter  in  hand  for</span><span>  some  time  in  the  endeavour  to  ascertain</span><span>  some  way  of  introducing  biological  con</span><span>  trol.  If  this  is  successful  it  will  be  the</span><span>  most  satisfactory  solution,  as  the  au</span></p> <p><span>  thoritios  will  be  relieved  from  having</span><span>  to  devise  other  means  of  tackling  the</span><span>  task,  undoubtedly  difficult,  owing  to</span><span>  the  vast  areas  to  be  covered  in  the  far</span><span>  North-west.  If  the  country  were  divid</span><span>  ed  into  email  areas  cattle,  could  be  treat</span><span>  ed,  but  in  Queensland1  and  the  Northern</span><span>  Territory  there  are  such  vast  runs  —</span><span>  which  are  often  unfenced  —  that  any</span><span>  sort  of  control  is  difficult.  Scientists</span><span>  have  found  that  there  are  at  least  three</span><span>  parasites  of  the  flies  in  the  East  Indies</span><span>  which  reduce  their  activities,  aud  it  is</span><span>  the  present  intention  to  introduce  these</span><span>  parasitic  wasps  to  Australia  in  the  liope</span><span>  that  Uiey  will  fulfil  a  similar  mission</span><span>  bcre.  Upon  the  success  of  this  enter</span><span>  prise  much  will  depend,  and  progress  in</span><span>  the  winter  months  will  be  awaited,  as</span><span>  it  is  felt  that  unless  the  flies  are  et</span><span>  least  partially  controlled  this  year  they</span><span>  will  make  further  progress  southward</span><span>  during  the  next  summer  season.  If  the</span></p> <p><span>  wasps  are  acclimatised  and  do  their</span><span>  work  thoroughly  they  may  be  the</span><span>  means  of  averting  a  deal  of  trouble</span><span>  later  on,  but  in  the  meantime  the</span><span>  watchfulnets  of  the  Queensland  Govern</span><span>  ment,  as  expressed  in  the  Minister  of</span><span>  Agriculture  and  Stock's  visit  to  the</span><span>  afl'ected  areas,  will  be  appreciated  by</span><span>  cattle  owners  generally.</span></p> ",Article,1931-05-07,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  *THE  CENTRAL  QUEENSLAND  HERALD  |</span><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span><span>  THURSDAY,  APRIL  9  1^31.</span></p> <p><span>  THE  WOOL  INDUSTRY</span></p> <p><span>  Tli-  announcement  of  the  Queensland</span><span>  Government's  policy  in  respect  to  the</span><span>  rehabilitation  of  the  wool  industry  shows</span><span>  that  mortgagees  generally  have  not  ac</span><span>  cepttd  the  offer  made  some  little  time</span></p> <p><span>  ago,  under  which  graziers  would  receive</span><span>  certain'  benefits  provided  that  interest</span><span>  rates  were  reduced  to  six  per  cent  for</span><span>  not  less  than  three  years.  The  Premier</span><span>  (Mr.  Moore),  stated  that  a  number  of</span><span>  wool  firms  and  private  mortgagees  had</span><span>  concurred  in  the  Government's  proposale,</span><span>  and  had  advised  him  officially  to  that</span><span>  uft'ecr;  but  the  other  wool  firms  and</span><span>  the  trading  banks  held  intimated  their</span><span>  inability  to  co-operate,  so  that  under</span><span>  the  circumstances,  there  has  been  no</span><span>  alternative  but  to  cease  negotiations  and</span><span>  10  -jiake  a  definite  pronouncement  of</span><span>  policy  under  which  those  lessees  who  are</span><span>  eligible  can  npply  for  their  own  con</span><span>  cessions.</span><span>  Ths  firms  which  are  willing  lo  co</span><span>  operate  in  this  matter  have  not  been</span><span>  disclosed,-  Lut  it  can  safely  be  assumed</span><span>  that  some  of  them  at  any  rate  have,</span><span>  concurred  because  of  their  association</span><span>  with  companies  holding  large  tracts  of</span><span>  pastoral  leases  which  are  of  consider</span><span>  able  value  for  grazing  purposes  and</span><span>  whicli  are  not  subject  to  renewal.  The</span><span>  concession  of  interest,  therefore,  allows</span><span>  these  leases  to  become  eligible  for  ex</span><span>  tensions,  which  is  a  privilege  well  worth</span><span>  obtaining,  even  though  Mr.  Moore  has</span><span>  made  it  clear  that  pastoral  leases  will</span><span>  not  lie  extended  for  a  longer  period</span><span>  ih?n  ten  years.  In  large  pastoral  liases</span><span>  comprisiug  good  grazing  land  suitable</span><span>  for  subdivision,  any  extension  of  lease</span><span>  will  be  subject  to  resumption  of  one</span><span>  third  to  one-half  on  the  expiration  oi</span><span>  tlio  present  lease,  and  a  further  resump</span><span>  tion  within  live  years;  but  this  conces</span><span>  sion  amounts  to  extending  grazing</span><span>  rights  over  large  areas,  so  that  the  re</span><span>  duction  of  interest  by  the  pastoral  com</span><span>  panies  concerned  amounts  to  little  more</span><span>  than  self-interest.</span><span>  It  would  be  interesting  lo  have  some</span><span>  forecast  of.  the  extent  to  which  Queens</span><span>  hind  giazieiB  will  benefit  through  these</span><span>  concessions,  but  to  do  so  would  neces</span><span>  sitate  information  regarding  the  ad</span><span>  vances  to  tlie  pastoral  industry  by  those</span><span>  mortgagees  willing  to  co-operate  with</span><span>  the  Government  and  those  unable  to</span><span>  do  so,  and  obviously  this  information</span><span>  would  be  extremely  difficult  to  secure.</span><span>  As  the  trading  banks  have  signified</span><span>  their  inability  to  join  in  the  scheme,</span><span>  together  with  'most  of  the  financial  in</span><span>  stitutions  concerned  in  the  industry,  it</span><span>  can  be  reckoned  that  the  actual  benefit</span><span>  derived  will  be  small.  There,  is  hope</span><span>  that  greater  concessions  will  follow,</span><span>  however,  as  the  Premier  stated  '  in  his</span><span>  announcement  that,  'if  any  of  the  bank6</span><span>  and  companies  principally  concerned  con</span><span>  sidered  that  the  Government's  proposals</span><span>  were  inequitable  and  unfairly  disadvan</span><span>  tageous  to  them,  the  Government  would</span><span>  have  the  matter  sifted  by  an  indepen-,</span><span>  dent  and  expert  ihquiry,  and  if  the  in-,</span><span>  vestigation  showed  that  the  Government's</span><span>  demand  for  a  temporary  reduction  of</span><span>  interest  to  0  per  cent  was  in  any  way</span><span>  inequitable  or  unnecessary  in  the  in</span><span>  terests  of  the  industry,  consideration</span><span>  would  be  given  to  reviewing  the  policy</span><span>  to  meet  the  position  disclosed.'</span><span>  ?  Undoubtedly  an  inquiry  of  this  type</span><span>  would  clear  the  air  considerably,  as  it</span><span>  would  do  a  lot  to  remove  the  impres</span><span>  sion  that  the  companies  interested  in</span><span>  the  wool  industry  have  made  fabulour</span><span>  returns  from  the  money  invested  there</span><span>  in.  Indeed,  it  can  safely  be  said  that</span><span>  during  the  last  few  years  their  profits</span><span>  have  been  generally  negligible  and  in</span><span>  addition  they  have  had  to  provide  j</span><span>  against  many  bad  debts  through  the  fall</span><span>  ing  away  of  their  security  values.  More</span><span>  over,  often  they  have  provided  mort</span><span>  gagors  with  living  and  carrying  on  ex</span><span>  penses,  although  the  recovery  .of  such</span><span>  advances  is  problematical  unless  wool</span><span>  and  stock  prices  rise  materially.  Un</span><span>  der  these  circumstances,  the  concessions</span><span>  made  by  capital  have  been  considerable,</span><span>  and  as  most  of  the  money  invested  has</span><span>  come  from  British  companies,  it  can  well</span><span>  be  understood  tnat  they  .  have  not  been</span><span>  able  to  accede  to  the  Premier's  request</span><span>  to  reduce  their  interest  charges.  TIip</span><span>  Treasury  and  the  people  generally  will</span><span>  be  the  prnicipal  gainers  'from  the  re</span><span>  covery  of  the  pastoral  industry,  and</span></p> <p><span>  thus  the  onus  of  reducing  costs  fall?</span><span>  chiefly  on  the  Government  itself.</span><span>  As  an  indication  of  the  ways  in  which</span><span>  Governmental  assistance  may  be  granted</span><span>  it  is  interesting  to  quote  the  ,-  relief</span><span>  sought  by  a  deputation  from  the  United</span><span>  Graziers'  Association  of  Queensland  when</span><span>  waiting  upon  the  Premier  recently.  It</span><span>  was  stated  that  relief  should  ,  take  the</span><span>  form  of  a  reduction  in  railway  freights,</span><span>  on  wool,  sheep,  and  cattle;  the  carry</span><span>  ing  forward  of  all  losses  for  taxation</span><span>  purposes;  the  abolition  of  the  State  land</span><span>  tax;  the  extension,  of  leases;  increase</span><span>  of  areas  where  less  than  a  living  area</span><span>  is  held;  and  a  reduction  of  rentals.</span><span>  Whether  assistance  will  be  given  along</span><span>  these  lines  remains  to  be  seen.  Obviously</span><span>  the  Government  is  satisfied  that  a  gene</span><span>  ral  case  -for  relief  exists,  and  even  if</span><span>  the  actual  concessions  available  to  gra</span><span>  ziers  are  not  as  yet  material,  the  an</span><span>  nouncement  of  Governmental  policy</span><span>  proves  the  existence  of  a  sympathetic</span><span>  Ministry,  which  will  probably  do  much</span><span>  to  rehabilitate  the  primary  industries</span><span>  of  the  State.</span></p> ",Article,1931-04-09,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

In  oilier</span><span>  ..words,  to  collect  last  year's  revenue  ?  ft'</span><span>  the  reduced  rate,  the  railways  must</span><span>  parry  11  per  cent  more  goods  and  pas</span><span>  sengers  for  nothing  without  affecting</span><span>  _slto  the  working  cost.

Governments</span><span>  never  Ifarn  by  experience  and  are  able</span><span>  to  dismiss  their  losses  with  a  noble</span><span>  gesture  to  the  taxpayer.  The  real</span><span>  development  behind!  that  £30,000,000  i*</span><span>  problematical.  It  represents  railways</span><span>  built  into  rich  gold  mines  which  could</span><span>  have  paid  many  times  over  for  their</span><span>  railway  communication.

There  also  have  been  suggestions</span><span>  that  some  of  the  settlers  who  accepted</span><span>  i1ib  terms  of  occunancv  at  Theodore</span></p> <p><span>  did  so  without  being  fully  equipped</span><span>  with  that  knowledge  of  farming  mat</span><span>  ters  which  is  so  essential  to  success.</span><span>  Those  suggestions  may  be  dismissed  on</span><span>  consideration  of  the  fact  that,  just  as</span><span>  the  settlers  accepted  the  prospectus</span><span>  conditions  which  bore  the  stamp  of  the</span><span>  Government  of  Queensland,  so  did  that</span><span>  Government  exercise  its  right  of  exclu</span><span>  sion  where  all  the  conditions  as  to  capi</span><span>  tal,  experience,  and  efficiency,  imposed</span><span>  by  it  were  not  met.  No  other  as</span><span>  sumption  is  possible.  To  suscest  that</span></p> <p><span>  the  Government  looked  only  into  thej</span><span>  financial  standing  of  applicants,  and  let</span><span>  its  conditi.  ??  as  to  experience  and</span><span>  farming  knowledge  go  by  the  board,  is</span><span>  to  accept  the  possibility  of  Govern</span><span>  ments  angling  for  the  poor  savings  of</span><span>  prospective  Bcttlers,  instead  of  going</span><span>  for  the  qualities  which  make  prosper</span><span>  ous  settlements.  To  explain  the  dis</span><span>  content,  we  therefore  have  to  accept</span><span>  the  view  either  that  pve-selection  of</span><span>  settlers  by  the  Government  was  per</span><span>  functory,  or  else  the  conditions  under</span><span>  ?which  settlers  are  to  live  are  other</span><span>  than  those  conditions  were  represen</span><span>  ted  to  be.  Either  the  settlers  have</span><span>  failed  to  make  proper  use  of  reasonable</span><span>  facilities  provided  by  the  Government,</span><span>  or  «lse  the  Government  has  imposed</span><span>  conditions,  quite  outside  the  original</span><span>  prospectus,  which  alter  materially  and</span><span>  vitally  conditions  under  which  eettlers</span></p> <p><span>  Jiavo  to  live  and  work  and  pay  tneir</span><span>  way.</span><span>  The  facts  are  that  irrigation  on  the</span><span>  Eeale  attempted  at  Theodore  is  at  least</span><span>  half  a  century  before  its  time.  The</span><span>  scheme  itself  at  Theodore  was  illcon</span><span>  ceived  and  insufficiently  .p  investigated.</span><span>  There  was  no  knowledge  of  whether</span><span>  the  Eite  selected  included  6uch  land  »b</span><span>  could,  under  favourable  natural  condi</span><span>  tions  as  to  rainfall  and  seasons,  be</span><span>  classed  as  good  agricultural  land.  Ono</span><span>  reason  {or  this  is  that  the  soil  is</span><span>  patchy,  and  in  comparatively  small</span><span>  areas  differs  widely  in  texture.  There</span><span>  was  an  intense  ignorance  respecting</span><span>  how  the  Theodore  soil—  or  assortment</span><span>  of  soils—  would  respond  to  irrigation</span><span>  as  a  regular  practice  over  an  indefinite</span></p> <p><span>  period.  Nor  was  there  any  indication</span><span>  that  Theodore  would  produce  at  lower</span><span>  cost  —  or  even  at  as  low  cost—  any-</span><span>  thing  that  was  not  already  being  pro</span><span>  duced  elsewhere  in  the  State.  The</span><span>  nearest  potential  market  of  any  preten</span><span>  sions  or  value  is  at  Rockhampton,  US</span><span>  miles  distant,  and  the  next  is  at  Bris</span><span>  bane,  which  is  545  mileB  away.</span><span>  But  none  of  these  factors  was  the</span><span>  concern  of  prospective  settlers.  De</span><span>  peudiug  as  they  did  upon  the  word  of</span><span>  responsible  Government,  they  were  en</span><span>  titled  to  assume  that  the  whole  of</span><span>  these  fundamental  points  had  been</span><span>  fully  and  properly  investigated.  That</span><span>  they  accepted  in  good  faith  the  assur</span><span>  ances  behind  governmental  advertising</span></p> <p><span>  respecting  the  Theodore  scheme  dis</span><span>  counts  their  caution  less  than  it  de</span><span>  tractB  from  the  common  honesty  of-  a</span><span>  responsible  Government  in  a  civilised</span><span>  land.  Yet  we  find  that  as  late  'as</span><span>  November,  1927,  four  Queensland  Gov</span><span>  ernment  agricultural  experts  after  in</span><span>  specting  the  Theodore  area,  announced</span><span>  that:</span><span>  'Largo  quantities  of  laud  were</span><span>  seen,  however,  which  would  require  »'</span></p> <p><span>  careful  soil  survey  before  sufficient</span><span>  information  would  be  available  to  de</span><span>  termine  the  suitability  to  either  irri</span><span>  gation  or  dry  farming.'</span><span>  Prior  to  that  considered  statement,</span><span>  an  extensive  advertising  campaign  in</span><span>  respect  to  the  Theodore  area  had  been</span><span>  inaugurated,  in  response  to  which  many</span><span>  settlers  no  doubt  were  attracted  to</span><span>  their  downfall.</span><span>  On  the  matter  of  water  for  dry</span><span>  blocks  the  same  quartette  of  agricul</span><span>  tural  experts  urged  that:</span><span>  '?'Tho  availability  of  a  supply  of</span><span>  water  for  the  dry  blocks  is  of  para</span><span>  mount  importance.  The  data  sub</span><span>  mitted  to  the-  Committee  was  not</span><span>  sufficient  to  satisfy  them  that  ample</span><span>  supplies  can  be  obtained.'</span><span>  In  view  of  recent  restrictions  upon</span><span>  the  use  of  water  for  irrigation,  this</span><span>  announcement  is  important.  To  pre</span><span>  sent  settlers  on  the  area  it  is  vital.</span><span>  There  is  little  doubt  that  had  actual</span><span>  conditions  as  they  now  apply  been</span><span>  notified  Theodore  would  have  obtained</span></p> <p><span>  very  few  settlers.  Yet  the  time  to</span><span>  make  known  those  conditions  is  when</span><span>  men  and  women  are  contemplating  a  step</span><span>  which  involves  sinking  the  savings  of</span><span>  their  past,  as  well  as  mortgaging  the</span><span>  whole  of  their  future,  lives.  The  ever</span><span>  present  spectre  in  the  minds  of  most</span><span>  Australian  farmers-  is  that  of  drought,</span><span>  when  months  of  work  may  be  swept</span><span>  away  through  lack  of  rainfall.  That</span><span>  being  the  case,  irrigation  offered  to</span><span>  them  insurance  against  such  losses,  yet</span><span>  it  would  appear  that  settlers  at  Theo</span><span>  dore  are  to  receive  water  for  irriga</span><span>  tion  purposes  during  our  nominal  wet</span><span>  seasons,  and  none  during  the  dry  win</span><span>  ter  months.  That  is  to  say,  they  are</span><span>  insured  only  against  failure  of  tho  wet</span><span>  season,  and  will  be  no  mom  phln  *n</span></p> <p><span>  embark  on  agricultural  ventures  during</span><span>  the,  dry  winter  than  is  the  man  who</span><span>  has  ample  cheap  land  and  no  irrigation.</span><span>  On  the  facts,  conditions  at  Theodoro</span><span>  call  for  full  and  open  enquiry.  If  men</span><span>  have  been  inveigled  there  under  false</span><span>  pretences  the  fact  should  be  recognised,</span><span>  and  an  honest  effort  made  to  compen</span><span>  sate  for  the  happening.  That  the</span><span>  fearful  bungle  came  as  a  legacy  to  the</span><span>  Moore  Government  is  no  excuse  for</span><span>  burking  plain  facts.  It  inherited  also</span><span>  the  legacy—  which  its  predecessors</span><span>  ignored  —  that  the  basis  'of  stable</span><span>  government  is  good  faith,  and  the</span><span>  Moore  Government  cannot  with  honour</span><span>  evade  that  legacy  any  more  than  it</span><span>  can  avoid  responsibility  for  contracts</span><span>  made  by  its  predecessors  to  the  settlers</span><span>  at  Theodore.</span></p> ",Article,1931-08-27,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

Being  the  first  of</span><span>  its  kind  in  Australia,  it  would  be  of</span><span>  even  greater  economic  importance  to  the</span><span>  nation  if  it  proved  the  forerunner  of  a</span><span>  wider  investigation  into  the  haphazard</span><span>  conduct  of  Australian  transport  affairs.</span><span>  Such  an  investigation  is  long  overdue,</span><span>  having  regard  to  the  fact  that  trans</span><span>  port  plays  so  important  a  part  in</span><span>  modern  life.  That  Australian  railway</span><span>  rates  are  the  highest  on  earth  provides</span><span>  another  reason  that  will  bulk  more  im</span><span>  portantly  as  tiier  problem  of  producing</span><span>  for  export  comes  to  be  faced.</span><span>  Compilation  of  the  report  has  brought</span><span>  together  many  data  not  previously</span><span>  known  outside  of  official  circles.  From</span><span>  those  data  have  been  deduced  some  con</span><span>  clusions  with  which  we  may  or  may  not.</span><span>  agree,  some  which  have  been  advanced,</span><span>  for  years  past,  and  some  which  are  new.</span><span>  In  all  cases  the  several  aspects  are  pre-'</span><span>  sented  afresh,  and  in  association  with!</span><span>  data  and  viewpoints  that,  if  they  do</span><span>  not  tend  to  agreement  at  least  advance</span><span>  the  problem  from  the  state  of  conjec</span><span>  ture  and  chaos  in  which  it  was  pre</span><span>  viously  enveloped.</span><span>  We  have  contended  consistently  that</span><span>  the  disparity  between  rates  on  goods</span><span>  carried  given  distances  along  coastal</span><span>  lines,  and  those  charged  on  the  same</span><span>  goods  for  the  same  distance  on  inland</span><span>  lines,  is  too  great.  The  report  has  ad</span><span>  duced  evidence  which  justifies  that  con</span><span>  tention,  while  it  has  not  been  similarly</span><span>  successful  in  justifying  the  practice.  The</span><span>  urge  to  '  develop  the  State  '  seems  to</span><span>  vary  with  the  helplessness  of  consumers</span><span>  of  different  districts  to  resist  imposts;</span><span>  that  is  to  say,  when  given  the  option  of</span><span>  extorting  the  last  available  penny  in</span><span>  freights  from  inland  consumers,  and  cut</span><span>  ting  the  rate  to  coastal  consumers  who</span><span>  have  alternative  methods  of  transport,</span><span>  the  Railway  Commissioner  employs  the</span><span>  method  which  meets  the  individual  case.</span><span>  He  claims  to  ''  assist  development  '  by</span><span>  charging  what  he  can  get  in  either  case,</span><span>  so  that  his  claim  has  more  the  aspect</span><span>  of  an  excuse  than  a  reason.  The  re</span><span>  port  states  that  the  '  to  ports  '  rates</span><span>  reduce  the  cost  of  living  in  ports,  and</span><span>  claims  for  the  inland  export  producer</span><span>  an  -obscure  relief  which  is  a  reflection</span><span>  from  the  cheaper  living  cost  in  coast</span><span>  ports.  We  hope  recipients  are  duly</span><span>  grateful.</span><span>  This  is  but  one  section  ot  the  report</span><span>  upon  which  we  are  not  in  total  agree</span><span>  ment  with  Professor  Brigden's  conclu</span><span>  sions.  For  instance,  he  states  (page</span><span>  16)  that  railway  losses  are  due  ''chiefly</span><span>  to  the  fact  that  there  is  not  enough</span><span>  traffic.'  On  page  66  he  announces</span><span>  that  '  The  port  of  Gladstone  is  over</span><span>  equipped  relative  to  its  trade,'  and  on</span><span>  page  68  that  the  Fitzroy  '  is  too  expen</span><span>  sive  for  the  trade  available  for  it.'</span><span>  Finally,  he  states  with  respect  to  Bris</span><span>  bane  that  '  its  revenue  is  falling  behind</span><span>  its  expenditure,  and  that  if  wool  or  other</span><span>  traffic  were  to  be  diverted  to  the  railway</span><span>  this  position*  would  be  worsened.'  The</span><span>  outstanding  features  of  these  incontro</span><span>  vertible  statements  is  that  there  are</span><span>  more  -  facilities  than  trade.  Brisbane</span><span>  cannot  Bpare  any  of  its  trade  to  the  rail</span><span>  ways  which  already  are  not  getting  suffi</span><span>  cient,  Gladstone  was  developed  in  ex</span><span>  cess  of  its  prospects  unless  it  could  get</span><span>  the  tradu  from  Port  Alma,  which  was</span><span>  established  long  before  Gladstone  was</span><span>  developed,  and  xtie  railways  generally</span><span>  must  have  trade  that  is  essential  to  the</span><span>  Fitzroy  River.  Out  of  these  factors</span><span>  emerges  the  most  definite  recommenda</span><span>  tion  of  the  report,  which  is  that  Port</span><span>  Alma  has  few  virtues,  and  might  with,</span><span>  advantage  be  abandoned.</span><span>  We  did  not,  know  previously  that</span><span>  other  than  incidentally,  the  terms  of  re</span><span>  ference  imposed  upon  the  Commissioner</span><span>  the  onus  of  adjudicating  -between  ports</span><span>  which  have  been  developed  deliberately</span><span>  as  the  outcome  of  government  policy.</span><span>  Nor  do  we  ascribe  more  than  accidental</span><span>  relation  between  that  recommendation</span><span>  and'-  the,  Minsterial  ukase  that  the  Trea</span><span>  surer  must  have  our  cash;  and  the</span></p> <p><span>  Minister  for  Railways  our  trade.  Yet</span><span>  it  appears  that  treatment  of  the  mat</span><span>  ter  of  higher  rates  on  goods  inland  from</span><span>  the  coast,  compared  with  those  applying</span><span>  to  the  same  goods  when  carried  parallel</span><span>  to  the  coast,  became  secondary  to  a</span><span>  purely  local  dispute  respecting  trade  be</span><span>  tween  two  ports.</span><span>  The  report  essays  to  show  that  loss</span><span>  accrues  to  the  State  through  shipping  at</span><span>  Port  Alma  instead  of  at  Gladstone,  and</span><span>  profit—  or  benefit  —  by  shipping  through</span><span>  Brisbane  instead  of  through  either  Cen;</span><span>  tral  Queensland  ports.  It  presents  a</span><span>  case  for  making  a  bad  railway  system</span><span>  pay  working  expenses,  but  is  not  clear</span><span>  upon  who  is  to  pay  the  interest.  In  the</span><span>  past  the  taxpayer  has  paid  it,  and  is</span><span>  now  confronted  with  paying  interest</span><span>  upon  £28,000,000  of  railway  capital  for</span><span>  which  no  assets  regain,  and  in  respect</span><span>  of  which  no  replacement  provision  was</span><span>  made.  This  treatment  lends  colour  to</span><span>  the  suggestion  that  'national'  services</span><span>  are  those  which  are  able  to  pass  on  their</span><span>  indebtedness  to  the  taxpayers,  as  against</span><span>  private  services  which,  must  give  ser</span><span>  vice  or  perish,  and  make  provision  out  of</span><span>  revenue  to  replace  wasting  assets.</span><span>  Read  in  conjunction  with  the  '  State</span><span>  Transport  Co-ordination  Act  '  the  report</span><span>  is  a  concession  to  railway  consciousness.</span><span>  That  consciousness  is  based  upon  no</span><span>  sounder  basis  than  that  if  the  railways</span><span>  are  allowed  to  handle  the  whole  of  the</span><span>  State's  traffic,  and  carry  it  for  suffi</span><span>  ciently  long  distances  they  will  meet</span><span>  working  expenses;  and  is  a  direct  nega</span><span>  tion  of  the  transport  maxim  that  the</span><span>  shortest  route  to  salt  water  bears  least</span><span>  heavily  upon  the  netion.  Having  this</span><span>  in  mind  it  is  as  well  to  remember  that</span><span>  it  is  less  a  question  of  whether  Glad</span><span>  stone  or  Rockhampton  get  the  trade,  as</span><span>  whether  Brisbane  gets  it  instead  of</span><span>  either.  Ships  that  now  call  at  Glad</span><span>  stone  do  eo  because  rival  ships  call  at</span><span>  Port  Alma,  Remove  that  competition</span><span>  and  both  lines  of  ships  will  remain  in</span><span>  Brisbane.  This  latter  procedure  would</span><span>  be  in  line  with  the  Railway  Commis</span><span>  sioner's  theory,  in  which  he  appears  to</span><span>  be  supported  by  Professor  Bridgden's</span><span>  report.</span></p> ",Article,1931-12-31,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

The  readmission  into</span><span>  '  ths  Cabinet  of  Mr.  Theodore,  notwith</span></p> <p><span>  standing  the  charges  against  his  per</span><span>  sonal  honour,  was  excused  on  the</span><span>  pround6  that  he  had  a  scheme  by  which</span><span>  the  nation  might,,  ba  saved.  The  scheme</span><span>  when  it  materialised  in  the  form  of  the</span><span>  issue  of  fiduciary  notes  —  or  notes  with</span><span>  out  backing  —  proved  to  be  one  that  has</span><span>  never  failed  to  plunge  any  country  suffi</span><span>  ciently  weak-  or  dishonest  to  adopt  it</span><span>  into  the  wildest  chaos,  the  most  abject</span><span>  misery.  The  price  to  the  Labour  party</span><span>  of  Mr.  Theodore's  readmission  to  Cabinet</span><span>  was  the  base  betrayal  of  Mr.  Lyons.  The</span><span>  price  of  such  readmission  to  the  nation  is</span><span>  a  wickedly  distfonest  attack,  through</span><span>  our  currency,  upon  wages,  pensions,  an</span><span>  nuities,  and  savings.  The  price  of  Mr.</span><span>  Forde's  appointment  to  Cabinet  rank</span><span>  is  his  support  of  a  project  that  both</span><span>  its  sponsor  and  Mr.  Forde's  leader  have</span><span>  roundly  condemned  for  much  the  same</span><span>  reason  tha£  we  condemn  it.  The  medir</span><span>  cine  of  the  patient  may  be  diluted,  the</span><span>  milk  of  the  children  watered,  but  Mr.</span><span>  Forde  retains  his  slippery  hold  on</span><span>  office  as  a  solatium  at  least  to  his</span></p> <p><span>  .  One  of  the  reasons  advanced  by  Mr.</span><span>  Theodore  for  'creating  credit'  by</span><span>  printing  money  was  that  a  brisk  buying</span><span>  of  Commonwealth  bonds  would  do  much</span><span>  to  restore  confidence  in  that  quarter.  In</span><span>  other  words,  he  proposed  to  revive  a</span><span>  debased  interest-bearing  paper  security</span><span>  by  printing  debased  non-interest  bearing</span><span>  paper  money.  He  would  cure  one  weak</span><span>  ness  by  creating  another,  -would  revive</span><span>  confidence  bV  injecting  the  debasement</span><span>  virus.  He  conveniently  overlooks  the</span><span>  fact  that  the  real  security  behind  any</span><span>  currency  as  the  character  of  the  men  who.</span><span>  control  it,  A  liighnational1  outlook  can</span><span>  perform  miracles  with  paper,  where  the</span><span>  outlook  ,of  a  'gang  of  tricksters  would</span><span>  turn  to  dross  even  the  purest  of  virgin</span><span>  gold.  The  breath  that  is  to  revive</span><span>  faith  in  the  breast  of  the  Australian</span><span>  people  ^nuBt  net  be  tainted  with  the</span><span>  recantations  and  betrayals  of  a  Scullin.</span><span>  or  the  political  past  of  a  Theodore,  The</span><span>  faith  that  can  move  mountains  is  not</span><span>  inspired  by  men  who  now  solemnly  de</span><span>  clare  the  path  to  salvation  to  be  that</span><span>  which  previously  was  described  by</span><span>  them  as  the  road  to  perdition.  That</span><span>  they  have  retreated  —  or  been  driven  by</span><span>  the  urge  for  office—  from  the  position</span><span>  they  previously  occupied  is  proof  more</span><span>  of  the  flexibility'  of  their  convictions</span><span>  than  of  the  elasticity'  of  economic  facts.</span><span>  Plasticity  'of  political  creeds  and  prin</span><span>  ciples  is  the  stock-in-trade  of  the</span><span>  political-  mountebank  ;  but  the  rigidity</span><span>  of  economic  fact  has  survived  countless</span><span>  acts  of  political  treachery,  and  will</span><span>  remain  after  i£ho  -curtain  lias  been  rung</span><span>  down  on  the,  last  political  fakir,  and</span><span>  after  the  last  political  betrayal  of  a</span><span>  people  has  been  lost  in  the  mists  of</span><span>  time.  .  ???  ?</span></p> <p><span>  Perhaps  the  best  reason  to  advance</span><span>  against  the  Scullins  setting  out  to  buy</span><span>  Commonwealth  bonds  with  the  £18,000,</span><span>  000  it  is.  proposed  to  print,  is  the  fact</span><span>  that  such,  a  process,  would  take  out  of</span><span>  their  fumbling'  hands  the  actual  spend</span><span>  -  ing  of  the  suggested  '  shinplasters.  '</span><span>  That  in  itself  is  sufficient  to  discredit</span><span>  the  scheme,  even  though  it  was  sagely</span><span>  suggested  by  the  Federal  Treasurer.  To</span><span>  invent  money  for  someone  else  to  spend</span><span>  is  far  beyond  the  philosophy  of  the</span><span>  Scullins,  so'  £hat  the  ingenious  project</span><span>  that  in  more  faithful  hands  has  the</span><span>  germ  of  an  inspiration  can  be  relegated</span><span>  to  the  vast  repository  of  politicians'</span><span>  utterances.</span><span>  In  the  Senate  during  the  debate  on</span><span>  the  '  Fiduciary  Bill  '  it  was  elicited</span><span>  that  £3,000,000  of  the  £18,000,000  would</span><span>  be  used  on  sewerage  works  in  Sydney.</span><span>  In  either  the  innocence  of  his  heart  or</span><span>  the  duplicity  of  his/mind  Senator  Barnes,</span><span>  without  knowing  the  comploted  cost  of</span><span>  ?  such  work,  or  the  capacity  of  the  rate</span><span>  i  *?  payers,  .already  carrying  a  load  of</span><span>  liabilities  equal  to  *»  per  cent,  of  the</span><span>  rateable  .vajuejpf  that  city,  to  cam-  -«t</span><span>  ?ore-  taxation,  said  that  such  works  i</span><span>  would  ^immediajtcly  return  from  11  per</span></p> <p><span>  cent,  to  13  per  cent,  on  their  capital</span><span>  cost.'  Yet  Senator  Barnes  is  Vice</span><span>  President  of  the  Executive  Council  in</span><span>  our  national  Parliament  !  He  probably</span><span>  debases  the  mental  or  moral  standard  of</span><span>  his  party  no  more  than  he  attempts  to</span><span>  debase  the  currency  of  the  nation,  but</span><span>  !his  is  not  the  standard  of  mentality</span><span>  or  logic  that  is  so  essential  to  the  re</span><span>  habilitation  of  the  simple  faith  of  the</span><span>  people.</span><span>  The  most  transparent  dishonesty  of</span><span>  the  business  is  ihat  the  Scullins  knew</span><span>  that  no  scheme  having  so  disastrous</span><span>  potentialities  could  hope  to  survive  .the</span><span>  Senate.  Just  ars  that  body  stood  between</span><span>  the  rapacity  of  the  Scullins  and  the</span><span>  savings  of  the  people  in  throwing  out</span><span>  the  Central  Reserve  Bank  Bill,  so  does</span><span>  it  now  stand  between  the  persistent</span><span>  attempts  of  the  Scullins  to  rob  the</span><span>  people  by  debasing  the  currency.

They</span><span>  wpre  called  'politicians.'  and  they</span><span>  passed  laws  for  their  own  protection.'</span><span>  It  is  somewhat  Gilbertian  that  the</span><span>  very  men  whose  follies,  political  dis</span><span>  honesty,  and  disregard  of  simple  econ</span><span>  omic  laws  brought  the  finances  of  Aus</span><span>  tralia  to  their  present  pass  should  also</span><span>  l-e  the  men  who  ache  to  give  us  a  new</span><span>  currency.

We  are  prone  to  speak  con</span><span>  temptuously  of  the  negative  use  to  which</span><span>  the  blacks  put  a  vast  continent.  They</span><span>  at  leaEt  managed  to  feed  themselves</span><span>  according  to  the  standard  to  which  they</span><span>  were  accustomed,  and  thousands  of</span><span>  white  Australians  to-day  would  be  glad</span><span>  if  they  were  assured  of  the  standard  of</span><span>  comfort  that  prevailed  when  the  first</span><span>  white  man  set  foot  on  Australian  soil.</span><span>  Not  long  ago  we  showed  that  Aus</span><span>  tralians  are  being  taxed  to  ensure  the</span><span>  export  of  wheat  they  themselves  can</span></p> <p><span>  not  afford  to  eat.  Were  that  an  isola</span><span>  ted  instance  arising  out  of  a  series  of</span><span>  unprecedented1  conditions  over  which  wo</span><span>  bad  no  control  -  the  circumstance  would</span><span>  be  sufficiently  startling  to  warrant  his</span><span>  toric  montiou.  Aa  the  consummation</span><span>  of  a  set  policy,  however,  it  ranks  surely</span><span>  as  a  major  catastrophe  that  transcends</span><span>  any  that  nature  in  her  harshest  moods</span><span>  ever  imposed  upon  us.</span><span>  But  this  was  no  chance  occurrence.</span><span>  For  the  first'  three  months  of  1930-31</span><span>  we  exported  ?  2,535,598  centals  of  floor</span><span>  at  an  average  value  of  8s.  9d.  per  cental</span></p> <p><span>  (100  lbs.).  At  the  same  time  the  re</span><span>  tail  price  of  flour  in  Sydney  —  the  centre</span><span>  of  gravity  of  Australia'*  want  and</span><span>  misery—  was.  ,16s.  4d.  per  100  lbs.  Of</span><span>  butter  we  exported  114,322  centals  at</span><span>  an  average  value  of  Is.  lid.  per  lb.  at</span><span>  the  same  time  that  the  retail  price  ia</span><span>  Sydney  was  Is.  lOd.  The  lowest  priua</span><span>  at  which  beef  was  procurable  in  Sydney</span><span>  was  6d.  per  lb.  for  shin  beef  (sirloin</span><span>  was  lid.),  but  at  the  same  time  wr</span><span>  were  exporting  it  for  less  than  3Jd.  per</span><span>  lb.  We  now  are  confronted  with  a</span><span>  problem  of  how  to  deal  with  a  vast</span><span>  surplus  of  sheep,  and  because  there  aro</span><span>  too  many  government  erecting  barrier*</span><span>  between  the  people  and  their  food.  tKe</span><span>  best  suggestion  so  far  comes  from  Mr.</span><span>  Moore.  Premier  of  Queensland.  He  i»</span><span>  prepared  to  face  a  reduction  of  30  per</span><span>  cent  of  railway  rates  on  sheep  —  pro-</span></p> <p><span>  i  tut;  muuuu  la  lui  exjiun.</span><span>  The  whole  position  is  false  in  fh-'</span><span>  extreme.  There  is  a  pathetic,  ?  unsatis</span><span>  fied  want  for  meat  to  feed  many  tliou</span><span>  sandB  of  Australian  children  who  ar«</span><span>  '  crowing  up  under  the  shadow  of  pan</span><span>  liry,  whose  most  consistent  sensations</span><span>  are  supplied  by  the  grim  pangs  of  hun</span><span>  ger.  Yet  there  in  no  concerted  effort,</span><span>  based  upon  the  most  elementary  of</span><span>  humanitarian  principles,  to  arranee</span><span>  cheap  transport  to  carry  the  bleseinc)</span><span>  of  a  bounteous  providence  to  them.  Our</span><span>  reductions  on  railway  rates  are  for  the</span><span>  benefit  of  people  on  the  other  side  of</span><span>  the  earth,  to  whom  our  mutton  would</span><span>  be  little  —  if  any  —  cheaper  than  alreadv</span><span>  is  available  to  them.  The  concession</span><span>  will  alleviate  no  want  there,  while  this</span><span>  people  who  give  it  are  compelled  to</span><span>  watch  their  own  flesh  and  blood  sinkius;</span><span>  under  all  the  evils  of  malnutrition.</span><span>  For  the  past  'year  politicians  have</span><span>  wrangled  more  or  less  disgracefully.</span></p> <p><span>  theorists  have  theorised  about  the  com</span><span>  plexities  of  a  currency  that  the  alarm*</span><span>  of  politicians  caused  to  be  locked  up,</span><span>  and  labour  unions  have  insisted  upon</span><span>  the  maintenance  of  a  'standard  of  liv</span><span>  ing'  that  applied  only  to  people  who</span><span>  wwe  fortunate  .enough  to  retain  then</span><span>  billets.  But  nobody  has  yet  conducted</span><span>  a  crusade  having  as  its  objective  tun</span><span>  simplification  of  our  national  life,  the</span><span>  .  removal  of  some  of  the  man-made  bar</span><span>  ;  riers  that  stand  between-  the  people  and</span><span>  their  food.  State  jealousies  have  .been</span><span>  kept  alive  by  politicians,  who  graduated</span><span>  in  many  cases.;  from-  -the  union,  bosses'</span><span>  desk,  from  .where  they  conducted  pro</span><span>  paganda  that,  fanned  the  dying,  Same  of</span><span>  resentment,  b,e,tFeen,  employer,  and  ptu</span><span>  ployed.  -  By-  far  -the  mast  formidable</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  obstacles  that  prevent  a  full  and</span><span>  proper  enjoyment  of  the  inheritance  we</span><span>  stole  from  the  blacks  are  man-made</span><span>  and  visionary.  They  are  based  upon  no</span><span>  sounder  foundation  than  a  shibboleth,  a</span><span>  meaningless  jargon  of  words  that,  piling</span><span>  Ossa  upon  Pelion,  form  a  towering  mesi</span><span>  ace  tlmt  spreads  dismay  and  want</span><span>  among  thousands.  It  is  the  'joss'  to</span><span>  which  Australian  politicians  and  union</span><span>  bobfces  compel  obedience,  and  yet  are</span><span>  unable  to  stave  off  the  very  perils</span><span>  against  which  the  fraud  is  invoked.  To</span><span>  preserve  the  standard  of  living  the  joss</span><span>  must  be  appeased,  yet  when  that  stand</span><span>  ard  has  evaporated  and  is  nothing  but</span><span>  a  blatant  fiction  the  joss  must  be  ap</span><span>  peased,  so  it  would  appear,  because  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  things  it  was  unable  to  prevent.</span><span>  While  politicians  wrangle,  union</span><span>  bosBes  orate  and  theorists  theorise  there</span><span>  is  an  urgent  demand  for  a  body  govern</span><span>  ed  by  the  rudiments  of  common  sento</span><span>  to  carry  the  surplus  food  of  Australia</span><span>  to  hungry  Australian  mouths.

Where  tho  uii-!</span><span>  paid  balance  under  mortgage  does  n°t</span><span>  exceed1  £2500.  application  for  reduction</span><span>  of  interest  must  be  made  through  the</span><span>  Magistrates'  Court,  and  through  the,</span><span>  Supremo  Court  where  the  balance  ex</span><span>  ceeds  that  amount.</span><span>  Within  one  year  from  proclamation</span><span>  of  this  portion  of  the  Financial  Emer</span><span>  gency  Act  any  mortgagor  may  apply</span><span>  for  reduction  of  interest  under  a  mort-  1</span><span>  gage  existing  at  the  passing  of  the  Act,</span><span>  and  the  mortgagee  will  be  given  an  op</span><span>  portunity  to  show  cause  why  such  re-|</span><span>  duction,  or  such  other  reduction  as  the</span><span>  Gourt  may  decide,  should  not  be</span><span>  granted.  But  there  are  important  re</span><span>  servations.  3fo  interest  payable  under</span><span>  mortgage  may  be  reduced  below  n-e  per</span><span>  cent  per  annum  of  the  outstanding</span><span>  amount,  and  no  reduction  of  interest</span><span>  can  be  more  than  twenty-two  and  a-half</span><span>  per  cent  of  such  interest.  That  is  to</span><span>  say,  interest  at  the  rate  of  less  than  6*</span><span>  per  cent  could  carry  only  such  reduc</span><span>  tion  aa  would  bring  it  to  6  per  cent,</span><span>  while  a  mortgage  bearing  interest  at</span><span>  the  rate  of  12}  per  cent  would  be  sub</span><span>  ject  to  a  reduction  of  £2  16s.  per  cent.,</span><span>  making  the  net  rate  of  interest  pay</span><span>  able  £9  13s.  9d.  per  cent.  The  Act</span><span>  therefore  d-oes  not  invade  the  pro</span><span>  visions  of  the  Act^  provided  to  protect</span><span>  mortgagors  against  excessively  high,</span><span>  rates  of  interest.  .</span><span>  This  last  point  is  important.  Nobody</span><span>  will  borrow  at  high  rates  of  interest</span><span>  where  lower  rates  are  on  offer,  and</span><span>  there  usually  is  relatively  cheap  money</span><span>  available  where  the  risk  is  sound.  The</span><span>  Financial  Emergency  Act  leaves  the</span><span>  risk  to  govern  the  interest  rate,  but</span><span>  provides  for  a  reduction  of  22$  per  cent,</span><span>  of  such  interest  to  conform  with  the</span><span>  decrease  in  gilt-edged  rates.  Apart  from</span><span>  the  moral  risk,  which  varies  with  the</span><span>  individual,  the  general  downward</span><span>  tendency  consequent  upon  interest  cuts</span><span>  will  decrease  also  the  eeneral  risks,  bo</span><span>  that  all  mortgages  given  after  the</span><span>  Financial  Emergency.  Act  is  proclaimed</span><span>  will,  on  the  whole,  carry  a  lower  rate</span><span>  of  interest.</span><span>  '  The  Act  of  course  is  incidental  to</span><span>  the  rehabilitation  policv  adopted  at  the</span><span>  recent  conference  of  Premiers,  and  is  an</span><span>  earnest  that  Queensland  is  not  lagging</span><span>  in  honouring  the  undertakings  made</span><span>  there.

It  is  yet  too  early  to  predict</span><span>  the  result  of  this  offer,  or  to  speculate</span><span>  on  its  reception  by  the  various  finan</span><span>  cial  institutions  involved,  but  it  is  fit</span><span>  ting  to  examine  it  in  an  endeavour  to</span><span>  ascertain  the  relative  sacrifices  to  be</span><span>  borne  by  the  Government  and  by  the</span><span>  business  community.</span><span>  Calculating  from  the  published  figures</span><span>  of  one  of  the  largest  Australian  wool</span><span>  broking  companies,  which  show  the  total.</span><span>  advances  made  and  the  number  of  bales</span><span>  ?f  wool  handled  durinc  the  season:  it  is</span></p> <p><span>  possible  to  estimate  the  amount  ad</span><span>  vanced  per  head  of  sheep  at  5s.  In  ad</span><span>  dition  to  this  there  are  the  graziers'</span><span>  liabilities  to  the  banks,  to.  other  com</span><span>  panies,  and  to  outside  individuals  which</span><span>  can  be  calculated  'at  an  additional  10s.</span><span>  per  head  of  sheep.  Tha  total  liabilty</span><span>  of  graziers  can  then  be  taken  to  approxi</span><span>  mate  15s.  per  sheep,  which  under  all</span><span>  the  circumstances  is  probably  under</span><span>  stated  for  Queensland,  when  it  is  con</span><span>  sidered  that  the  figures  are  calculated</span><span>  on  Australian  returns  which  include  the</span><span>  States  which  ?  were  free  of  the  heavy</span><span>  drought  expenditure  incurred  by  Queens</span><span>  land  in  1936  and  following  years.  More</span><span>  over  each  graeiar's  liability  is  reckoned</span><span>  in  terms  of  debt  per-  head  of  sheep,</span><span>  whereas  'in  many  instances  the  value  of</span><span>  the  property  is  included  in  the  security.</span><span>  Generally  speaking  banks  have  been  pre</span><span>  pared  to  grant  heavier  advances  than</span><span>  the  pastoral  finance,  institutions.  They</span></p> <p><span>  look  to  the  interest,  to  provide  their  pro</span><span>  fits,  whereas  the  latter  concerns  prefer</span><span>  to  restrict  their  advances  so  as  to  ob</span><span>  tain  the  maximum  return  df  profits  for</span><span>  their  investment  through  the  medium  of</span><span>  wool  brokerage,  and  commission  on  other</span><span>  station  business  which  follows  the</span><span>  financing  of  pastoral  accounts.  But  it</span><span>  is  questionable  whether  the  pastoral</span><span>  finance  institutions  would  consider  re</span><span>  ducing  interest  in.  one  Sta'  \  in  the  Com</span><span>  monwealth,  thereby,  allowing  a  precedent</span><span>  of  which  othor  States  might  avail  them</span><span>  selves.</span></p> <p><span>  The  extent  of  the  concession  asked  '?of</span><span>  the  pastoral  finance  companies,  in  fav</span><span>  our  of  clients  operating  iii  Queensland</span><span>  is  capable  of.  ostimation  by  taking  the:</span><span>  number  of  sheep  at  20,000,000,  and  an</span><span>  average  debt  per  sheep  of  15s,  to  all</span><span>  financial  institutions.  '  This  gives  a</span><span>  total  debt  of  £15,000,000,  and  assuming</span><span>  an  average  interest  rate  of  7*  per  cent</span><span>  the  yearly  interest  bill  is  £1,125,000,</span><span>  Reduced  to  6  per  cent  the  interest  bill</span><span>  would  be  £900,000,  and  the  concession</span><span>  to  be  made  by  pastoral  finance  insti</span><span>  tutions,  banks,  and  private  lenders</span><span>  would  be  £225,000.</span></p> <p><span>  If  this  concession  be  granted,  the</span><span>  Government  will  extend  the  lease  of  the</span><span>  grazier  and  will  make  reductions  in  rent</span><span>  in  cases  where  the  rents  have  not  re</span><span>  cently  bwn  determined  on  the  wool</span><span>  slump  basis.  .Regarding  the  extension</span><span>  of  leases,  apart  from  pastoral  holdikgB</span><span>  the  offer  is  of  little  value,  as  grazing</span><span>  selectors  —  the  Bmall  men  who  hold  living</span><span>  areas  and  are  the  type  needing  assist</span><span>  ance—are  practically  assured  a  renewal</span><span>  of  their  lease  in  perpetuity  under  exist</span><span>  ing  land  laws,  and  therefore  an  exten</span><span>  sion  of  .  seven  years  would  neither  en</span><span>  liance  the  value  to  the  owner  nor  the</span><span>  security  to  the  finance  company  or  bank.</span><span>  '  This  being  so  the  only  inducement  is</span><span>  that  of  the  rent  reduction,  but  here,</span><span>  Mr.  Moore  states  that  it  does,  not  apply</span><span>  '  to  '  such  rents  as  have  recently  been</span><span>  determined  by  the  Land  Court-  on  the</span><span>  wool  slump  -basis,'  so  that  here  again</span><span>  the  offer  loses  much  of  its  significance.</span><span>  It  is  at  this  etage  interesting  to  see</span><span>  what  the  Government  is  really  sacrific</span><span>  ing  itself  in  the  way:  j-f,  income.

THE  RISE  IN  WOOL</span></p> <p><span>  The  most  heartening  event  of  recent</span><span>  tnonthB  is  undoubtedly  the  rise  in  wool</span><span>  values  at  the  Brisbane  March  wool</span><span>  tales,  which  is  at  present  estimated  to.</span><span>  be  in  the  neighbourhood  of  25  per  cent.</span></p> <p><span>  ,  improvement  on  the  January  series.</span><span>  Since  that  date  there  have  been  consis</span><span>  tent  rises  in  prices  at  the  wool  sales</span><span>  held  in  other  centres  throughout  the</span><span>  Commonwealth,  and  at  the  last  Sydney</span><span>  bales  the  price  averaged  approximately</span><span>  lOd.  per  lb.  Under  these  circumstances,</span><span>  it  was  expected  that  the  Brisbane  sales</span><span>  ?would  show  a  decided  improvement  to</span><span>  bring  them  into  line  with  the  Southern</span><span>  values  ruling,  and  it  is  pleasing  to  note</span><span>  that  the  anticipated  improvement  has</span><span>  leen  manifestvl,  and  that,  if  anything,</span><span>  there  is  a  slight  increase  over  the  latest</span><span>  Sydney  level.</span><span>  Just  what  the  actual  averages  will  be</span><span>  i*  yet  a  matter  of  conjecture  as  the</span><span>  sales  are  still  in  progress,  but.  judging</span><span>  fey  the  opening  values  they  will  be  al</span><span>  most  lOd.  per  lb.,  and  £13  per  bale.  At</span><span>  the  January  sales  in  Brisbane,  which</span><span>  were  the  worst  for  years  for  Queensland</span><span>  woolgrowers,  the  averages  were  7-8d.</span><span>  per  lb.,  and  £10  per  bale,  but  many</span><span>  (growers  from  Central  Queensland  ob</span><span>  tained  only  £6  or  £7  per  bale  when  they</span><span>  receiyed  their  account  6ales  nett,  and  ob</span><span>  viously  this  return  was  not  profitable.</span><span>  Present  prices  will  still  be  unprofitable</span><span>  from  the  grower's  point  of  view,  but</span><span>  they  will  be  encouraging,  and  a  gradual</span><span>  tiEe  of  a  further  few  pence  per  poun-1</span><span>  will  make  all  the  difference  between  re</span><span>  munerative  and  unremunerative  pasto</span><span>  ral  activities.</span><span>  The  extent  of  the  tota)  financial  bene</span><span>  fit  involved  if  the  sales  continue  on</span><span>  their  present  basis  —  as  there  is  every</span><span>  prospect  of  doing  —  will  be  considerable,</span><span>  as  the  offering  now  catalogued  is  45,000</span><span>  bales,  and  the  increase  of  approximately</span><span>  £8  per  bale  will  amount  to  £135,000.</span><span>  Moreover,  including  the  present  offering,</span><span>  the  Brisbane  auctioneers  expect  to  cata</span><span>  logue  about  235,000  bales  before  the  end</span><span>  bf  the  current  wool  serips  in  June  next,</span><span>  eo  that  an  improvement  to  existing</span><span>  levels,  even  without  any  further  rise,</span><span>  ?frould  assist  wool  growers  to  the  extent</span><span>  of  £700,000.  Queensland  is  thus  fortun</span><span>  ate  in  having  a  large  quantity  of  wool</span><span>  on  hand  at  the  end  of  the  selling  tea</span><span>  son,  when  the  other  States  have  practi</span><span>  cally  exhausted  their  catalogues,  eo  that</span><span>  the  growers  of  this  State  whose  wool</span><span>  has  not  yet  been  sold  will  derive  a</span><span>  material  benefit.  Before  the  end  of  the</span><span>  Geries,  there  may  even  be  a  further  im</span><span>  provement,  as  each  sale  recently  has</span><span>  Bhown  some  slight  increase  in  competi</span><span>  tion  and  prices,  and  this  being  so  the</span><span>  total  benefit  to  the  sheep  owners  of  this</span><span>  State  may  reach  even  greater  figures</span><span>  than  the  estimates  given  above.</span><span>  Ibere  are  several  features  about  the</span><span>  rise  in  wool  prices  which  are  worth  men</span><span>  tioning.  It  is  noticeable  that  all  grades</span><span>  of  wool  are  sharing  in  the  improvement,</span><span>  and  buyers  arc  Apparently  keen  enough</span><span>  to.  accept  the  lower  grades  .  of  wool</span><span>  which  were  some  months  ago  selling  at</span><span>  such  a  low  figure  that  it  did  not  pay</span><span>  to  forward  them  to  the  auctions.  Under</span><span>  the  improved  conditions  prevailing,</span><span>  many  owners  will  be  able  to  despatch</span><span>  these  types  of  wool  for  sale  at  reason</span><span>  able  rates,  thereby  receiving  fair  ?  re</span><span>  .  turns-  for  wool  which  is  now  lying  on</span><span>  their  properties-  J5ven  these  low  grades</span><span>  -  of  .wool  were  '  being  purchased  by  me</span><span>  buyers  during  the  period  of  depressed</span><span>  prices,  but  it  was  only  the  finer  quali</span><span>  ties  which  eecured  acceptable  prices,</span><span>  whereas  now  apparently  the  buyers  are</span><span>  willing  to  give  fair  figureB  for  all  grades.</span><span>  The  high  quality  wools  are  still  selling</span><span>  .  best,  but  the  discrepancy  has  beeu</span><span>  Bomewhat  reduced,  which  is  a  matter</span><span>  for  satisfaction  among  those  growers</span><span>  who'  cannot  produce  the  fine  wools.</span><span>  The  consistency,  and  strength  of  Japa</span><span>  nese  buying  is  now  most  noticeable.  Dur</span><span>  ing  the  periods  when  other  buyers  were</span><span>  holding  off,  the  Japanese  continued  their</span><span>  consistent  support  with  the  result  that</span><span>  their  manufacturers  now  hold  large</span><span>  quantities  of'  wool  purchased  much  be</span><span>  low  Existing  levels.  This  assists  them</span><span>  materially,  but  their  good  fortune  will</span><span>  not  1)0  .grudged  them,  as  without  their</span><span>  support  the  Australian  Bales  would  have</span><span>  been  utter  failures.  Even  now,  they</span><span>  are  bidding  consistently  on  a  rising</span><span>  market.  and  giving  a  deal  of  strength  to</span><span>  the  demand.  Generally,  speaking,  the</span></p> <p><span>  gradual  improvement  of  Japanese  buy</span><span>  ing  over  the  last  few  years  has  been</span><span>  one  of  the  most  important  factors</span><span>  affecting  the  Australian  sales,  and  ap</span><span>  parently  their  support  may  be  expected</span><span>  to  continue.  Often  their  support  has</span><span>  induced  the  local  level  of  prices  to  re</span><span>  main  higher  than  that  existing  in  Lon</span><span>  don,  which  has  had  a  bearish  influence</span><span>  on  the  wool  market,  so  much  so  that</span><span>  the  severe  fall  in  the  Brisbane  January</span><span>  sales  was  largely  accounted  for  by  the</span><span>  decline  in  London.  It  must  not  be  'or</span><span>  grtten  that  the  London  wool  salcj  also</span><span>  o;jen  this  week,  but  with  the  strength</span><span>  of  the  bidding  from  the  Japanese  and</span><span>  various  Continental  buyers,  the  pros</span><span>  pects  of  an  adverse  reaction  are  imma</span><span>  terial.</span><span>  If  the  improved  price  level  is  an  indi</span><span>  cation  of  a  gradual  overseas  recovery</span><span>  from  depression,  it  will  not  be  very  long</span><span>  before  the  benefit  is  felt  in  the  Com</span><span>  monwealth  also,  as  so  much  reliance  is</span><span>  placed  on  world  markets  to  assist  the</span><span>  national  income,  and  improved  prices</span><span>  will  immediately  augment  Australian</span><span>  overseas  funds.</span></p> ",Article,1931-03-19,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

Then</span><span>  on  December  11th  of  the  same  year  the</span><span>  Commonwealth  Parliament  passed  the</span><span>  Manufacturers'  Encouragement  Act,</span><span>  which  provided  for  a  bounty  of  12s.</span><span>  per  ton  011  pig  iron  made  from  Aus</span><span>  tralian  ore,  and  another  12s.  per  ton  on</span><span>  filed  made  from  the  pig  iron.  It  is</span><span>  wo;  th  noting-  that  the  ore  was  not  to</span><span>  lie  imported.  The  Act  was  amended  iu</span><span>  l'J12  to  include  a  bounty  of  10  per  cent</span><span>  on  the  value  of  galvanised  iron  and</span><span>  wire,  but  legislators  were  mere  novices</span><span>  in  those  days,  as  the  total  amount  paid</span><span>  when  these  Acts  were  superseded  by</span><span>  the  Iron  Bounty  Act  of  1914  was</span><span>  £l!i:i.4S'.i.  1</span></p> <p><span>  Under  the  new  Act  (1914)  the  total</span><span>  Binount  authorised  to  be  paid  was</span><span>  £l5'J.Uuu,  then  came  the  Iron  and  Steel</span><span>  Bounty  of  1'JiS,  which  authorised</span><span>  another  £2U0,uuu.  This  was  followed  by</span><span>  Hie  Act  of  1922,  under  which  there  lms</span><span>  lieeu  paid  in  bounties  011  iron  and  steel</span><span>  the  Mini  of  £1,738,900.

The</span><span>  value  of  land,  buildings,  plant,  and  ma</span><span>  chinery  in  the  iron  and  steel  industries</span><span>  of  Australia  lias  leaped  from  £9,102,411</span><span>  in  1908  to  £51,233,000  in  1929.  Assum</span><span>  ing  that  capital  to  have  cost  6  per  cent</span><span>  —  it  is  likely  to  have  cost  more  rather</span><span>  than  less  —  the  interest  bill  has  jumped</span><span>  from  £340,745  to  £3,073,991.  To  meet</span><span>  that  overhead  burden  very  large  output</span><span>  is  essential,  as  it  would  impose  a  load</span><span>  of  over  four  per  cent  on  the  whole  iron</span><span>  and  steel  consumption  —  imported  and</span><span>  other  —  of  Australia  for  the  year  1929.</span><span>  Tlie  probabilities  are  that  the  1929  con</span><span>  sumption  will  not  be  repeated  lor  some</span><span>  years.</span><span>  For  the  future  of  the  iron  and  steel</span><span>  industries  there  is  little  prospect  that</span><span>  is  pleasing.  There  will  be  no  more  de</span><span>  velopmental  works  for  many  years,  the</span><span>  land  is  littered  with  unproductive  and</span><span>  useless  railways,  while  development  and</span><span>  building  generally  have  far  exceeded  re</span><span>  quirements.  The  load  of  interest  upon</span><span>  dead  'developmental'  works  is  a</span><span>  steadying  factor,  and  the  inescapable</span><span>  conclusion  is  that  if  Australia  does  not</span><span>  import  another  scrap  of  iron  or  steel</span><span>  for  the  next  t«n  years,  her  demands</span><span>  will  have  no  more  than  overtaken  the</span><span>  flagrant  over-development.</span><span>  The  cold,  hard,  facts  arc  that,  in</span><span>  credible  as  it  may  seem,  Australia  to</span><span>  get  work  for  her  idle  iron  and  steel</span><span>  factories  must  set  out.  to  produce  on  an</span><span>  export  basis.  This  does  not  mean  that</span><span>  she  is  to  export  at  low  rates  subsidised</span><span>  by  high  rates  at  home.  Her  citizens</span><span>  must  have  the  same  benefits  of  cheap</span><span>  goods  that  she  has  for  many  years</span><span>  given  to  overseas  customers.  She  must</span><span>  allow  them  to  buy  as  well  as  sell  in</span><span>  cheap  markets,  to  do  which  she  must</span><span>  face  resolutely,  the  need  to  remove  from</span><span>  industry  many  of  the  crippling  restric</span><span>  tions,  as  well  as  many  of  the  cloying</span><span>  spoon-  feedings.</span></p> <p><span>  As  to  export  of  iron  and  steel  pro</span><span>  ducts,  it  obviously  would  be  impractic</span><span>  able  at  first  to  contemplate  high-grade</span><span>  goods.

The  short'</span><span>  est  way  to  decide  the  question  would  be</span><span>  to  take  that  referendum  which  the</span><span>  (courts  and  common  sense  prescribe;  and</span><span>  since  the  vote  would  be  taken  on  the</span><span>  State-wide  -  adult  franchise  one  would</span><span>  imagine  that  such  a  course  would  com</span><span>  mend  itself  to  the  ultra-democratic  go</span><span>  vernment  of  the  mother  State.  An  ap</span></p> <p><span>  peal  to  the  people  at  this  juncture  would</span><span>  serve  a  double  purpose;  it  would  indi</span><span>  cate  just  where  the  principle  of  a  legis</span><span>  lative  check  upon  the  Assembly  fits</span><span>  into  their  scheme  of  things,  and  it  would</span><span>  show  how  far  the  Lang  Government  has</span><span>  progressed  in  public  estimation  since  it</span><span>  took  office.  Having  swept  ?  the  State</span><span>  as  he  did  at  last  election,  the  Premier</span><span>  should  welcome  the  opportunity  of  ask</span><span>  ing  the  people  to  reaffirm  their  supreme</span><span>  confidence  in  his  leadership.  An  over</span><span>  whelming  vote  in  bis  favour  would  fur</span><span>  nish  recalcitrant  Federal  Labour  mem</span><span>  bers  with  some  food  for  solid  thinking;</span><span>  perhaps  give  Mr.  Beasley  a  bigger  fo!</span></p> <p><span>  lowing;  perhaps  convert  tne  oaucua,  bv</span><span>  heart  more  interested  in  political  stra</span><span>  tegy  than  in  sound  finance,  to  the  notion</span><span>  that  the  Lang  plan  is  better  propaganda</span><span>  than  the  Theodore  scheme,  and  lead  them</span><span>  to  adopt  it  as  their  slogan  for  the  ap</span><span>  proaching  election.  There  is  so  much</span><span>  to  be  gained  by  bold  leadership  —  and  in</span><span>  most  things  Mr.  Lang  is  bold  to  the</span><span>  point  of  sheer  audacity!  But  if  ihc</span><span>  strength  of  Mr.  Lang's  position  lies  in</span><span>  the  majority  the  people  gave  him  at  the</span><span>  election,  its  weakness  is  that  he  canuot</span><span>  risk  »  failure.  He  contrived  to  keep  the</span><span>  East  Sydney  Federal  election  in  his  own</span><span>  hands,  'because  a  win  of  some  sort  was</span><span>  assured  in  that  Labour  fastness;  but  it</span><span>  was  the-  fcind  of  victory  that  indicates</span><span>  that  the  enthusiasm  for  Labour  has</span><span>  passed  its  peak,  and  is  rapidly  traad</span><span>  ing  downwards  even  in  the  traditional</span><span>  Kf.™eiiolds  of  the  party.  It  is  further</span></p> <p><span>  significant,  that  on  the  same  day  a  State</span><span>  election  took  place,  and  although  that</span><span>  the  Opposition  had  a  multiplicity  of  can</span><span>  didates  the  Government  did  not  venture</span><span>  to  put  forward  one.  Tfcus  it  is  that  de</span><span>  spite  the  fact  that  the  short  cut  to  a</span><span>  decision  is  also  the  high  democratic</span><span>  road,  Mr.  Lang  discreetly  prefers  a  safer</span><span>  route  through  what,  in  other  moments</span><span>  he'Vould  probably  describe  as  that  high</span><span>  Tory  institution,  the  Privy  Cour.cil.</span><span>  There  is  a  tradition  in  at  least  some</span><span>  Labour  circles  that  judges  are  guard</span><span>  ians  of  the  established  order,  whosa</span><span>  prejudices-  it  iB  difficult  to  break  down.</span><span>  If  there  is  any  truth  in  the  view  that</span><span>  judges  are  swayed  by  such  human  sen</span><span>  timents  it  is  inconceivable  that  the</span><span>  doctrines  of  a  Lang  would  predispose</span><span>  the  more  conservative  courts  of  Britain</span><span>  to  take  a,  kindlier  view  of  his  demand</span><span>  to  run  legislative  riot  through  the  coia</span><span>  'try.  To  grasp  fully  the  futility  of  hia</span><span>  attitude  we  have  only  to  remember  that</span><span>  a  further  unsuccessful  appeal  will  still</span><span>  involve  him  in  -the  referendum  he  is</span><span>  now  shirking.</span><span>  The  sober-minded  electors  ot  New</span><span>  South  Wales  must  congratulate  them</span><span>  selves  on  the  forethought  which  has</span><span>  given  them  even  this  measure  of  protec</span><span>  tion  against  legislative  freeboothers  of</span><span>  the  Lang  and  Theodore  type.

I</span></p> <p><span>  THE  WORKER  AND  HIS  DWELLING</span></p> <p><span>  Iftne  was  when  a  worker  could  obtain</span><span>  ?  dwelling  of  four  main  rooms,  kitchen,</span><span>  and  front  and  back  verandahs,  with  a</span><span>  total  floor  area  of  1200  superficial  feet</span><span>  for  £210.  That  was  in  1910,  when  the</span><span>  tariff  on  timber  was  only  15  per  cent,</span></p> <p><span>  and  timber  royalties  collected  by  the</span><span>  State  Government  amounted  to  only</span><span>  £34,000.  Also,  we  had  not  gone  tariff</span><span>  mad  in  the  ingenuous  belief  that  we</span><span>  could  tax  ourselves  into  a  state  of  afflu</span><span>  ence.  Since  that  year  there  has  been</span><span>  a  world  war,  when  values  fell  back  if</span><span>  anything,  while  costs  and  prices  soared</span><span>  out  of  eight.  There  has  been  a  period</span><span>  of  frenzied  loan  spending,  as  well  as  a</span><span>  long  spell  of  paving  the  way  of  the</span><span>  worker  with  softer  material  than  he  pre</span><span>  viously  trod.  There  has  been  a  forestry</span><span>  policy,  that  eeems  to  have  worked  on</span><span>  the  principle  of  hoarding  the  forest</span><span>  wealth  and  jtaxing  heavily  its  present</span><span>  day  use.  There  also  has  been  a  steady</span><span>  growth  in  tariffs  on  timber  and  gal</span><span>  vanised  iron,  the  latter  to  establish  an</span><span>  industry  to  produce  a  material  that  would</span><span>  to  a  large  extent  supplant  timber.</span><span>  Among  the  whole  of  these  factors,  to</span><span>  gether  with  increases  in  wages,  the  cost</span><span>  of  a  dwelling  of  the  identical  specifica</span><span>  tions  to  that  mentioned  above  was  on</span><span>  1028  £472,  or  £2  5s.  for  every  £1  paid</span><span>  for  exactly  the  same  dwelling  in  1910.</span><span>  Taking  interest  at  5  per  cent,  the  capi</span><span>  tal  value  of  the  1910  figure  carried  an</span><span>  interest  bill  of  £10  5s.  per  annum  or  4s.</span><span>  per  week.  On  the  1928  figure  the  an</span><span>  nual  interest  would  be  £23  12s.  and</span><span>  per  week  it  would  be  9s.  Id.  Thus  the</span><span>  weekly  rent  ol  thousands  of  dwellers  in</span><span>  cottages  of  this  type  has  been  increased</span><span>  for  all  relevant  time  by  6s.  Id.  be</span><span>  cause  the  State  Government  was  hungry</span><span>  for  timber  royalty  and  stumpage,  iron</span><span>  workers  were  protected  by  high  tariffs</span><span>  of  building  iron,  and  carpenters  and</span><span>  plumbers  were  in  clover.

The  cottages</span><span>  under  review  were  built  by  day  labour</span><span>  under  Labour  regime,  and  the  timber</span><span>  came  direct  from  the  State  Forest  Ser</span><span>  vice  in  most  cases,  and  yet  the  uplifters</span><span>  of  the  masses  could  do  no  better  than</span><span>  more  than  double  the  cost  to  the  worker</span><span>  of  his  housing.</span><span>  What  the  increased  royalty  really  does</span><span>  represent  is  the  amount  it  was  possible</span><span>  to  take  because  of  increased  tariff  pro</span><span>  tection.  When  a  new  tariff  is  imposed</span><span>  tlwre  are  circulated  loose  guarantees</span><span>  that  people  on  whoso  account  the  im</span><span>  posts  are  made  will  not  increase  prices.</span><span>  Here  is  a  case  where  a  Labour  Govern</span></p> <p><span>  ment  followed  the  tariff  on  timber  with</span><span>  an  increase  in  timber  royalty,  and  treat</span><span>  ed  the  resultant  revenue  not  as  a  special</span><span>  fund,  having  as  its  objective  cheaper</span><span>  housing  or  cheaper  anything.  It  went</span><span>  ipto  revenue  and  was  squandered  in  mak</span><span>  ing  billets  for  the  friends  of  politicians.</span><span>  But  the  owner  of  a  1928  workers'  dwell</span><span>  ing  who  is  paying  off  his  instalments</span><span>  in  the  form  of  rent  nas  round  his  neck</span><span>  a  load  of  9s.  Id.  per  week  for  which</span><span>  he  has  no  more  to  show  than  has  the  man</span><span>  who  carried  only  4s.  while  paying  off</span><span>  bis  1010  cottage.</span><span>  This  instance  is  but  one  of  many  that</span><span>  can  bs  cited  as  results  of  trying  to  bring</span><span>  nearer  the  millennium  by  taxation.  The</span><span>  Federal  Government  taxed  imported  tim</span></p> <p><span>  ber  so  that  local  timbers  could  compete,</span><span>  whereat  the  State  Government  taxed</span><span>  local  timber  to  the  full  extent  of  the</span><span>  tariff  protection.  Behind  the  timber</span><span>  tariff  wall  they  built  up  a  Forest  Ser</span><span>  vice  which  absorbs  59  per  cent  of  the</span><span>  total  royalties  in  wages  and  salaries,</span><span>  whereas  in  1914  only  5  per  cent  was  bo</span><span>  absorbed.  Like  all  other  indiscriminate</span><span>  imposts  it  breeds  more  and  worse  abuses</span></p> <p><span>  than  those  it  is  intended  to  remove  or</span><span>  correct,  and  hardly  a  ramification  in  the</span><span>  whole  of  the  needs  of  the  worker  es</span><span>  capes  the  effects.  What  is  more,  the  in</span><span>  creased  cost  survives  high  wages,  is</span><span>  an  increasingly  heavy  drag  as  wages</span><span>  fall,  and  is  an  insufferable  load  when</span><span>  wages  cease  altogether.</span><span>  Blessed  with  some  of  the  finest  timbers</span><span>  on  earth,  we  have  so  managed  our  herit</span><span>  age  that  only  by  an  extortionate  sys</span><span>  tern  of  taxation  can  we  avail  ourselves</span><span>  of  nature's  bounty,  or  do  better  with</span><span>  our  splendid  timbers  than  so  load  them</span><span>  with  taxes  that  the  cheapest  way  out</span><span>  of  the  difficulty  of  using  them  is  to  send</span><span>  them  up  in  smoke.</span></p> ",Article,1931-10-29,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

He</span><span>  claimed  that:</span><span>  'The  control  of  the  public  purse</span><span>  heretofore  has  always  been  regarded</span><span>  as  an  essential  prerogative  of  the</span><span>  people,  a  prerogative  which  is  exer</span><span>  cised,  not  by  banking  institutions,  but</span><span>  by  the  people's  representatives  in  Par</span><span>  liament.'</span><span>  The  prerogative  of  the  people  began</span><span>  and  ended  in  selecting  the  brand  of</span><span>  spendthrift  they  wanted  to  have  the</span><span>  squandering  of  available  money.  It  had</span><span>  nothing  to  do  with  determining  the</span><span>  amount  of  loan  money  a  new  and</span><span>  sparsely  populated  land  could  absorb,</span><span>  or  what  interest  load  the  inhabitants  of</span><span>  that  sparsely  inhabited  laud  could  carry.</span><span>  It  usually  was  influenced  by  the  most</span><span>  plausible  taje,  the  most  glittering  pro</span><span>  mises;  and  was  swayed  more  by  men</span><span>  whose  knowledge  of  mob  psychology  far</span><span>  outshone  their  knowledge  of  economics,</span><span>  than  it  was  by  simple  irreducible  facts</span><span>  6tatod  by  honest  men  who  had  nothing</span><span>  to  gain  by  hiding  the  simple  truth.  It</span><span>  has  been  the  prerogative  of  the  people</span><span>  of  Australia  to  turn  from  the  truth  and</span><span>  accept  the  sham,  to  be  misled  by  the</span><span>  charlatan  instead  of  being  guided  by</span><span>  uane  counsels,  to  be  attracted  by  the  tin</span><span>  eel  and  to  ignore  the  finer  works  of  art.</span><span>  The  prerogative  of  the  people  may  ex</span><span>  tend  to  accepting  Theodore  in  the  Com</span><span>  mnmrnoltn  «.ffov  Rnurninsr  liim  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  State,  to  adopting  a  policy  of  mean</span><span>  swindles  after  declaring  for  national</span><span>  honour.  But  the  prerogative  cf  the</span><span>  people  cannot  make  effective  money,</span><span>  though  it  can  rob  existing  money  of  much</span><span>  of  its  virtue;  nor  can  it  compel  the</span><span>  trust  of  people  with  money  to  lend,  he</span><span>  that  money  in  pence  or  pounds,  in  tens</span><span>  or  in  thousands.</span><span>  The  outburst  of  Edward  Granville</span><span>  Theodore  therefore  is  against  something</span><span>  that  never  prevailed.  The  prerogative</span><span>  of  the  people  extended  only  to  approv</span><span>  ing  of  politicians  whose  programmes  of</span><span>  largesse  most  forcefully  attracted  them.</span><span>  It  then  was  left  to  politicians  to  put</span><span>  iuio  effect  those  programmes  if  and</span><span>  when  they,  could  get  the  money  —  always</span><span>  provided  they  were  not  thrown  out  by</span><span>  more  giddy  promises  before  they  had</span><span>  lime  to  in&pire  the  confidence  of  the</span><span>  money  .  market.  But  the  prerogative  of</span><span>  ilie  money  market  to  lend  or  not  lend,</span><span>  according  to  the  character-  of  the  people</span><span>  Kho  proposed  to  do  the  borrowing,  never</span><span>  has  been  questioned  v~\M  now.  It  Lab</span><span>  been  left  to  Edward  Granville  Theodore</span><span>  to  announce  that  the  divine  right  of</span><span>  politicians  transcends  even  that  of  own</span><span>  ership,  and  that  the  banks  must  lend</span><span>  him  the  savings  of  their  clients,  .  not</span><span>  withstanding  the  simple  fact  that  tiic</span><span>  greater  portion  of  those  savings  already</span><span>  have  been  borrowed  onco.</span><span>  If  the.  impudent  challenge  th-  out</span><span>  by  Australia's  most  accomplished  mob</span><span>  psychologist  is  allowed  to  pass,  the  *s</span><span>  curity  offered  to  thrifty  people  by  the</span><span>  banks  wili  be  swept  away  like  so  mucli</span><span>  sand.  If  -control  over  the  deposits  of</span><span>  their  clients  is-  to  be  taken  from  bank</span><span>  ers  and  vested  in  politicians,  the  much</span><span>  desired  confidence  in  Australia's  poten</span><span>  tial  wealth  is  going  to  be  indeliuitcly</span><span>  delayed.  Pew  people  are  going  to  bu</span><span>  unduly  enthusiastic  about  turning  po</span><span>  tential  into  real  wealth  if  politiciaus</span><span>  arc  to  have  the  run  of  their  banking</span><span>  accounts.  Yet  Australia's  tragic  Trea</span><span>  surer  says  this  is  'an  essential  preroga</span><span>  tive  of  the  people.'  The  Common</span><span>  wealth  Bank  Board  says,  in  effect,  that</span><span>  it  does  not  believe  Mr.  Theodore,  that</span><span>  il,  regards  tha  intrusion  of  politicians  in</span><span>  the  vicinity  of  the  bank's  vaults  with</span><span>  little-  less  trepidation  thau  it  would  a</span><span>  gang  of  *i-pert  safe-breakers,  and  that</span><span>  it  is  not  disposed  to  relinquish  the  trust</span><span>  it  undertook  with  respect  to  the  savings</span><span>  at  the  people.</span><span>  The  'broad  facts  are  that  Australia's</span><span>  politicians,  have,  borrowed  so  much  over</span><span>  seas  that  people  there  are  exercising</span><span>  their;  prerogative  by  not  lending  any</span></p> <p><span>  more.  They  also  are  somewhat  exercised</span><span>  with  respect  to  both  the  principal  and</span><span>  iDterest  of  that  which  they  already  have</span><span>  lent.  The  people  within  Australia  have</span><span>  even  less  reason  to  rcpo-j  confidence  in</span><span>  their  own  politicians,  and  are  exercis</span><span>  ing  their  prerogathe  by  not  lending</span><span>  money  that,  in  Lny  case,  is  needed  to</span><span>  carry  011  Australian  trade  and  industry.</span><span>  Even  Mr.  Theodore  recognises  this  dis</span><span>  inclination  to  lend  him  mon-'-.  just  as</span><span>  he  must  remember  that  M:\  Lyons  got</span><span>  upwards  of  £20,000,000  of  new  money  a</span><span>  few  short  months  ago.  The  preroga</span><span>  tive  involved  here  is  that  which  the</span><span>  people  of  Australia  exercised  to  trust</span><span>  Mr.  Lyons,  and  are  exercising  again</span><span>  in  their  determination  not  to  trust</span><span>  Theodore.  Lyons  asked  for  money  to</span><span>  finance  a  policy  of  national  stability  aud</span></p> <p><span>  honour.  Theodore  asks  for  power  to</span><span>  seize  the  money  which  the  r-v'  of  Aus</span><span>  tralia  will  not  lend  to  him.  Lyons  in</span><span>  spired  confidence  where  Theodore  prates</span><span>  of  'prerogative.'  Lyons  got  all  the</span><span>  help  lie  ueeded  through  tiie  voluntary</span><span>  «ct  of  people  who  trusted  him.  Theo</span><span>  dore  aims  at  confiscating  the  savings  of</span><span>  the  people  in  defiance  of  the  prerogative</span><span>  they  exercise  by  not  lending  it  to  him.</span><span>  It  is  one  of  the  clearest  indications  that</span><span>  only  a  desperate  bid  for  supremacy  over</span><span>  the  people  and,  their  savings  would  save</span><span>  the  Scullins  from  annihilation,  and</span><span>  there  probably  never  was  an  abler  ex</span><span>  ponent  of  the  extreme  instability  of  their</span><span>  cause  than  Edward  Granville  Theodore.</span></p> ",Article,1931-04-23,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

Yetj</span><span>  in  Australia  it  ranks  still  as  a  serious'</span><span>  affection  of  man,  while  its  economic  effect</span><span>  upon  live  stock  is  considerable.  That</span><span>  it  is  so  appears  inexplicable,  particularly</span><span>  since  the  necessary  measures  by  which</span><span>  it  may  be  controlled  are  known  and,</span><span>  somparatively  speaking,  simple.  But</span><span>  Australia  is  not  alone  in  this  respect,  as</span><span>  both  in  France  and  Germany  there  has,</span><span>  in,  recent  years,  been  expressed  concern</span><span>  at  its  continued  incidence  and,  in  some</span><span>  instances,  increase.  -  i</span><span>  Research  in.  Australia  during  the  past</span><span>  five  or  six  years  has  revived  interest</span><span>  in  the  matter  of  controlling  this  disease,!</span><span>  and  some  very  remarkable  discoveriesj</span><span>  have  been  made.  In  the  first  place,  in</span><span>  New  South  Wales,  South  Australia  and</span><span>  Western  Australia  there  hfts  in  tbej</span><span>  last  few  years  been  a  marked  increase</span><span>  in  th--  number  of  cases.  On  the  otherj</span><span>  hand,  the  number  of  cases  within  metro-,</span><span>  politan  areas  have  decreased  in  direct</span><span>  ratio  to  improvement  in  abattoir  prac</span><span>  tice,  so  that  increase  in  the  number  of)</span><span>  cases  would  appear  to  depend  very  ma-(</span><span>  terially  upon  the  conditions  which  pre</span><span>  rail  at  slaughtering  establishments  in</span><span>  rural  districts.</span><span>  Of  the  animals  subject  to  infestation</span><span>  the  dog  stands  pre-eminent  and  the  do</span><span>  mestic  cat,  so  lpng  under  suspicion,  is</span><span>  declared  liable  only  to  accidental  infes</span><span>  station.  The  dingo  is  -nder  only.  slight</span><span>  suspicion,  and  the  fox  is  in  a  similar</span><span>  category.  But  all  dogs  are  not  alike</span><span>  liable  to  infestation.  Their  occupation</span><span>  is  the  determining  factor,  as  no  signs</span><span>  were  found  in  one  hundred  dogs</span><span>  examined  in  Sydney,  while  the  farm  and</span><span>  station  dog  is  at  the  other  end  of  the</span><span>  list  with  an  infestation  of  39  per  cent.</span><span>  The  slaughter-yard  dog  comes  next  with</span><span>  30.5  per  cent,  and  the  drover's  dog  with</span><span>  7-1  per  cent.  The  rabbiter'a  dog  was</span><span>  found  to  be  free  from  the  hydatid  para</span><span>  site,  but  18  per  cent  of  them  were</span><span>  heavily  infested  with  Taenia  sp.  or  rib</span><span>  bon  worm,  and  it  was'stated  that  such</span><span>  percentage  really  was  low  by  comparison</span><span>  v  ?friTthat  ''generally  found  where  the</span><span>  principal  diet  of  the  dogs  was  the  flesh</span><span>  of  rabbits.  *  ?***?</span><span>  Of  the  animals  subject  to  hydatid  in</span><span>  fection  the  sheep  is.  the  most  important,</span><span>  with  cattle  next..

This  arises  out</span><span>  of  the  slow  growth  of  the  hydatid  cyst,</span><span>  a  fact  that  for  a  time  led  to  the  be</span><span>  lief  that  ewes  and  cows  were  more  sub</span><span>  ject  to  the  hydatid  disease  than.  were</span><span>  wethers  and  steers,  the  real  reason  being</span><span>  that  females  usually  are  slaughtered  at</span><span>  an  average  later  age  than  maleB.  A</span><span>  peculiar  feature  is  the  fact  that  in  man</span><span>  infection  of  the  liver  by  hydatids  num</span><span>  ber  about  three,  to  each  -case  of  lung  in</span><span>  fection.  In  stock  the  proportion  is  about</span><span>  ihe  same,  but  lung  infection  predomi</span><span>  nates.</span><span>  As  the  dog  is  the  principal  host  of</span><span>  the  tapeworm  which,  carries  the  disease</span><span>  lo  man,  he,  comes  into  i&e  forefront</span><span>  when  considering  methods  oi  control.</span><span>  Feeding  raw.  offal  to  him  is  always</span><span>  fraught  with  danger,  and  where  lie  has</span><span>  tlui  tun  of  the  slaughter  yard  to  feed</span><span>  off  j^iw  viscera  of  sheep  the  risk  is  es</span><span>  pecially  great.  It  is  pnly  less  so  in  the</span><span>  case  of  raw  'viscera  from  cattle  and  pige.</span><span>  A*  the  disease  is  largely  .a*  country  one,</span><span>  and,  for  that  matter,  one  Tvhere  the</span><span>  st«fe  population  is  high,  .:  special  leach</span><span>  ingf  should  be  included  in  ^he'syllabue</span><span>  of  country  schools.  '  Since'  we  know  -«o</span><span>  much  about  Hie  disease,  'ftnd  since  the</span></p> <p><span>  !  dog  is  the  most  effective  carrier,  it  should</span><span>  be  comparatively  simple  to  combat  the</span><span>  disease  by  observance  of  a  few  common</span><span>  sense  precautions.  There  is  no  reason</span><span>  for  the  dog  to  fair  from  his  high  estate.</span><span>  AH  that  is  needed  is  that  he  be  intel</span><span>  ligently  fed,  and  not  left  to  feed  him</span><span>  self.

They,  of  course,  were  not  to</span><span>  know  that  the  Moplahs  were  Mahomme^</span><span>  dan  fanatics,  bigoted  and  ignorant,  bent</span><span>  upon  the  forcible  conversion  of  their</span><span>  Hindu  neighbours.

The  administration  of  Bri</span><span>  tain  has  proceeded  in  the  endeavour  to</span><span>  give  to  each  class  and  sect  protection</span><span>  under  which  to  work  out  their  own  des</span><span>  tinies.  Contrary  to  popular  belief,  tha</span><span>  protection,  needed  was  against  the  wild</span><span>  excesses  of  Indians  against  their  own</span><span>  (colour,  and  against  the  superstitions</span><span>  (that  have  teen  handed  down  from  tims</span><span>  immemorial.</span><span>  'Another  legend  is  that  the  wealth  of</span><span>  India  ended  with  the  rise  of  British</span><span>  jjower,  before  which  the  government  of</span><span>  Tillages  and  districts  was  benevolent</span><span>  and  arcadian.  The  facts  arc  that  the</span><span>  .  splendour  of  the  ?  ruler  became  a  by-word</span><span>  while  the  hopeless  misery  and  poverty</span><span>  of  the  ruled  was  beneath  mention.

Af</span><span>  ghanistan  and  other  adjoining  races,</span><span>  ybile  the  Pindaris  of  Central  India  re</span><span>  garded  the  people  of  the  plains  as  legi</span><span>  timate  .victims  for  their  insensate  fero</span><span>  city.  Tliie  takes  no  account  of  inter</span><span>  tribal  wars,  sometimes  in  defence  of</span></p> <p><span>  Religious  rites,  at  other  times  to  gratify</span><span>  the  vanity  of  petty  princes.  The  most</span><span>  democratic  factor  in  India  in  pre-British</span><span>  times  wore  the  plagues  and  pestilences</span><span>  that  throve  on  the  ignorance  and  super</span><span>  stition  of  the  people,  and  carried  off</span><span>  In  hundreds  of  thou6auds  both  invader</span><span>  and  invaded.

It  would</span><span>  be  as  misleading  to  suggest  that  Bri</span><span>  tish  administration  has  removed  the</span><span>  whole  of  these  disabilities  and  inflic</span><span>  tions,  as  it  is  to  assert  that  they  did</span><span>  not  exist  before  the  establishment  of</span><span>  British  rule  in  India.</span><span>  Not  the:  least  of  the  difficulties  con</span><span>  fronting  any  improvement  in  the  physi</span><span>  cal  condition  of  the  people  of  India  is</span><span>  the  'fact  that  customs  that  have  all  the</span><span>  power  of-  superstitious  play  an  import</span><span>  ant  part  in  the  daily  life  of  the  -nation.</span><span>  The  objection  of  the  Hindu  to  the  tak</span><span>  harbourage  for  tho  black  rat,  which  is</span><span>  the-hoBt  of  the  floa  that  carries  the</span><span>  germ  of  bubonic  plague.  For  the  ser</span><span>  yVe  he  confers  by  infecting  his  hoste</span><span>  Wltb  this  fell  disease,  the  rat  imposes</span><span>  ?  loll  upon  the  grain  harvest  equal  to</span></p> <p><span>  £16,000,000  annually.  The  veneration</span><span>  of  the  Hindu  for  the  cow.  stands  between</span><span>  any  improvement  of  the  scraggy  breed,</span><span>  and  at  the  same  time  causes  an  econo</span><span>  mic  loss  in  consumed  fodder  equal  to</span><span>  another  £16,000,000  each  year.  Thus  it</span><span>  is  not  only  the  people  who  have  to  be</span><span>  fed.1  Their  pets  and  pests  also  have  to</span><span>  be  taken  into  economic  account,  as  noth</span><span>  ing  has  yet  been  devised  that  will  aepa</span><span>  rate  the  one  from  the  other.  Yet  the</span><span>  average  Labour  prator  knows  nothing</span><span>  of  these  facts.  All  that  he  is  concerned</span><span>  in  is  that  Britain  is  to  blame.</span><span>  With  so  cosmopolitan  and  polyglot  n</span><span>  mass  the  work  of  the  noisy  minority</span><span>  has  bean  easy.  The  Mahommedan  agi</span><span>  tators  from  Bengal  have  'taken  for  their</span><span>  slogan  '  India  for  the  Indians,'  in  total</span><span>  disregard  of  the  fact  that  what  they</span><span>  really  mean  is  a  reversion  to  the  pre</span><span>  British  days  when  20  per  cent,  of  the</span><span>  whole  peoples  of  India  held  in  subjec</span><span>  tion  the  other  80  per  cent.  Tn  the</span><span>  meantime,  the  .industry  of  the  people</span><span>  under  British  administration  has  ear</span><span>  tablished  industries  and  vrealthproduc</span><span>  ing  agencies  that  provide  occupation</span><span>  and  wages  for  many  millions  of'  Indian</span><span>  people.  The  .rights  of  those  people  to</span><span>  their  own  religions  and  observances  have</span><span>  been  preserved,  their  condition  has  'been</span><span>  improved  by  the  provision  of  transport</span><span>  and  public  utilities,  as  well  as  by  medi</span><span>  cal  and  educational  facilities  previously</span><span>  undreamt  of.  The  noisy'  minority  give</span><span>  no  guarantee  of  good  faith  that  all  or</span><span>  any  of  these  will  survive  under  the  go</span><span>  vernment  they  propose  to  establish.</span><span>  They  even  are  hazy  with  respect  to  the</span><span>  form  of  government  itself,  and  are  given</span><span>  more  to  rhetoric  than  to  reason.  Backed</span><span>  by  Soviet  gold,  they  play  the  part  of</span><span>  the-  Moscow  Communists  that  Moscow</span><span>  makes  no  attempt  to  conceal.

It  is  iu  fact  at</span><span>  least  400  years  older  than  Christianity</span><span>  on  the  evidence  of  Plato  alone,  and  it</span><span>  probably  was  not  new  in  his  time.</span><span>  Every  age  and  most  countries  have  at</span><span>  one  time  or  another  hajd  their  expon</span><span>  ents  of  communism.  It  has  many  off</span><span>  slioots  and  affinities,  though  most  of</span><span>  them  are  but  variations  of  the  sanio</span><span>  idealistic  principle  that  abolition  of  pri</span><span>  vate  ownership  is  the  keynote  on  which</span><span>  depends  the  well-being  of  humanity.</span><span>  The  first  essential  to  a  belief  in  com</span><span>  munism  is  complete  disagreement  with</span><span>  all  prevailing  social  or  economic  con</span><span>  ditions  based  upon  the  right  of  indi</span><span>  viduals  to  possess  or  hold  property  of</span><span>  any  description.  This  at  once  throws</span><span>  the  cult  open  to  the  wildest  exploita</span><span>  tion  at  the  hands  of  opportunists  and</span><span>  political  -  thimble-riggers.  Nothing</span><span>  comes  easier  to  the  average  human  be</span><span>  ings  than  self-pity,  which  is  the  firsl</span><span>  6tep  toward  dissatisfaction  with  theit</span><span>  lot  when  they  fall  easy  victims  to  the</span><span>  plausible  tales  of  calculating  politicians.</span><span>  To  such  dupes  comes  also  pleasurable</span><span>  anticipation  that  their  lot  is  to  be  per</span><span>  fected  at  the  expense  of  more  fortun</span><span>  ate  members  of  the  community.  We</span><span>  thus  have  scope  for  endless  permuta</span><span>  tions,  which  range  from  exploiters  of</span><span>  ideals  to  those  who  are  ex</span><span>  ploited  because  they  confuse  ideals</span><span>  with  a  disgruntled  outlook  on</span><span>  --ife,  and  a  sneaking  desire  for</span><span>  someone  else's  property  with  their</span><span>  rights  to  6uch  property.  This  is  the</span><span>  practical  side  of  communism.  It  is</span><span>  the  side  that  is  best  known  in  Austra</span><span>  lia,  the  side  that  has  elevated  more</span><span>  uplifters  of  their  kind  to  places  of</span><span>  power  and  affluence  than  any  other</span><span>  «iugle  factor.  ;  the  side  that  has  brought</span><span>  to  disaster  more  purely  altruistic</span><span>  schemes  of  communism  than  has  dis</span><span>  sension  among  its  chief  apostles.</span><span>  Another  factor  which  detracts  from</span><span>  the  popularity  of  communism  is  that</span><span>  it  is  not  an  idealistic  state  which  can</span><span>  be  attained  by  easy  stages.  It  is</span><span>  reached  only  through  the  total  —  and,</span><span>  vTiere  necessary,  ruthless  —  obliteration</span><span>  af  the  present  'form  of  social  organisa</span><span>  tion,  together  with  the  annihilation  of</span><span>  any  who  oppose  the  change.  ?

The  number  of  such  ven</span><span>  tures  is  legion,  and  is  equalled  only</span><span>  lc  their  failures.</span><span>  Closely  allied  with  communism  of</span><span>  property  have  always  been  radical  views</span><span>  on  the  family  tie  and,  the  communism</span><span>  of  wives  and  children,  together  with</span><span>  more  than  suggestion  ^6f  birth  control;</span><span>  Plato,  although,  he  foreshadowed  equal</span><span>  ity  for  women  in  all  tho  prof  essions</span><span>  ».nd  careers,  .sUH  ;  regarded  her  as  por</span><span>  tion  of  her  husband's  goods  and  chat</span><span>  tels,  and,  therefore,  meant  to.  become</span><span>  the  property  of  the  communist  society</span><span>  together  with  -.his  .'other  goods.  From</span><span>  it  he  evolved  his  Platonic  or  spiritual</span><span>  love,  an  idealistic  theory  that  ha;</span><span>  started  many  millions  of  people,  toward</span><span>  either  the  altar  or  the  beach  of  promise</span><span>  court.

Almost  bis</span><span>  first  act  on  returning  was  to  welcome</span><span>  back  into  Cabinet  the  leader  of  the  men</span><span>  who  betrayed  the  Melbourne  Conference,</span><span>  the  six  States  who  were  loyal  to  that</span><span>  Conference,  Mr.  Lyons  —  who  fought  *or</span><span>  the  honour  of  the  nation  —  and!

He  also  is  distinguished  in  that</span><span>  he  was  abandoned  by  Mr.  Bcullin  whose</span><span>  flaunted  principles  he  upheld  during  the</span><span>  Prime  Minister's  absence  in  Dondon,  as</span><span>  well  as  by  Mr.  JTorde,  who  supported!</span><span>  him  to  the  extent  that  he  did  openly</span><span>  support  Mr..

Mr.  Bcullb'e</span><span>  reward  for  his  apostacy  is  the  certainty</span><span>  of  political  annihilation  through,  either</span><span>  the  forces  his  betrayal  of  Mr.  Lyons</span><span>  has  invoked,  or  else  at  the  hands  of.  ate</span><span>  ncw  allies  who  have  made  of  him  ?»</span><span>  trembling  puppet.</span><span>  Mr.  FordeV  reward  is  the  rank  he</span><span>  has  gained!  through  every  'division,  reso</span><span>  lution,  '  composition,  and  refinement  of</span><span>  political  chemistry,  crowned  by  an  act</span><span>  of  political  treachery  that,  in  associa</span><span>  tion  with  that  of  his  sorry  leader,  has</span><span>  raised  a  atom  of  indignation  through</span><span>  out  Australia.  Their  present  positions</span><span>  Inquired  men  who  had  as  little  feeling</span><span>  lor  their  own  dignity  as  for  the  wel</span><span>  fare  of  the  nation,  and  it  is  open  to  them</span></p> <p><span>  J  to  prove  that  Mr.  Theodore  drove  a</span><span>  I  bad  bargain.  From  beine  servants  of</span><span>  Australia  they  have  become  the  slaves</span><span>  of  a.  Trades  Hall  junta,  and  public</span><span>  sentiment  indicates  that  the  junta  is</span><span>  welcome  to  them.  The  people  are  not</span><span>  slow  to  realise  that  the  treachery  which</span><span>  desert's  a  friend  might,  by  comparison,</span><span>  be  a  virtue  compared  to  the  fawning</span><span>  baseness  which  attaches  itself  to  a  de</span><span>  clared  enemy.,  or  to  the  policy  of  a  de</span><span>  clared'  enemy.</span><span>  We  once  described  the  status  of  Mr.</span><span>  Forde  in  Cabinet  as  that  of  a  Minister's</span><span>  batman.  It  is  one  of  the  paradoxes  of</span><span>  a  time  of  bartering  principles  for  place</span><span>  that  he  had  first  to  -descend  still  lower</span><span>  in  the  scale  to  rise  to  his  present  eleva</span></p> <p><span>  tion.  If  he  would  claim  that  loyalty</span><span>  to  his  leader  condones  his  abandonment</span><span>  of  Mr.  Lyons,  he  but  advances  an  act</span><span>  of  black  ingratitude  to  justify  one  of</span><span>  faithlessness.</span><span>  The  terms  under  which  Mr.  Lyons</span><span>  could  hold  oflice  in  the  Cabinet  did  not</span><span>  permit  him  to  preserve  his  self  respect</span><span>  The  man  whom  he  had  protected1  from</span><span>  the  'credit'  fakirs  during  his  absence</span><span>  succumbed  to  the  same  gang  shortly</span><span>  after  his  return  and  demanded  of  Mr.</span><span>  Lyons  that  he  also  capitulate.  On  the</span><span>  confidence  that  he  inspired  dHiring  the</span><span>  absence  of  Mr.  Scullin.  Mr.  Lyons</span><span>  floated  successfully  a  loan  for  more</span><span>  than  £28,000,000.  He  accomplished  that</span><span>  by  assurances  of  sanity  in  Federaf</span><span>  finance,  and  by  openly  flouting  th»</span><span>  forces  in  Caucus  'which  toyed  with</span><span>  repudiation,  advocated  Inflation,  and'</span><span>  vowed  vengeance  on  the  banks  who</span><span>  committed  no  greater  sin  than  they</span><span>  protected  the  savings  of  the  people.  On</span><span>  his  performances  since  returning,  the</span></p> <p><span>  absence  of  Mr.  ^Scullin  during  that</span><span>  crisis  was  providential,  as  there'  is  noth</span><span>  ing  to  show  that  the  forces  to  which</span><span>  he  has  succumbed  now  would  have</span><span>  been  less  successful  then.</span><span>  Although  Mr.  .Scullin  still  is  Prime</span><span>  Minister  of  Australia,  he  has  atone  more</span><span>  to  discredit  Federal  Labour  than  any</span><span>  one  of  recent  years.

His  coming</span><span>  coincides  with  the  open  season  for  opos</span><span>  sums,  when  hollow  trees  are  being  ran</span><span>  sacked  and  thousands  of  good  Austra</span><span>  lians  are  losing  their  pelts  without  a</span><span>  chance  to  'show  cause.'

This</span><span>  view  is  strengthened  by  the  fact  that</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Forde  is  excusing  himself  to  his</span><span>  political  masters  and  not  explaining  his</span><span>  political  doings  to  his  constituents.</span><span>  National  crises  may  —  and  do  —  come  and</span><span>  go,  and  Mr.  Forde  can  —  and  does  —  re-J</span><span>  main  discreetly  absent,  but  a  crisis</span><span>  among  the  few  obscure  bodies  which</span><span>  ?control  his  nomination  for  the  Capri</span><span>  cornia  electorate  brings  Mr.  Forde  post</span><span>  Jiasto  to  treat  with  the  few  while  he  re</span><span>  mains  silent  to  the  many.</span><span>  Cattle  owners  would  be  glad  to  hear</span><span>  from  Mr.  Forde.  When  he  unpacked</span><span>  his  pre-election  wares  at  the  New</span><span>  Thoatre,  Rockhampton,  on  24th  Septem</span><span>  ber,  1929,  he  announced  that  he  per</span><span>  ?onally  favoured  a  bounty  on  the  ex</span><span>  pirtable  surplus  of  beef  for  five  years.</span><span>  Good  trade  beef  then  was  33s.  per  100</span><span>  lbs.,  and  now  that  prime  beef  is  down</span><span>  to  20s.  and  21s.  per  100  lbs.  Mr.  Forde's</span><span>  concern  for  the  cattle  men  should  be  at</span><span>  fever  heat.  His  silence  on  the  matter</span><span>  was  explained  on  9th  April,  1930,  by</span><span>  stating  that  as  beef  in  December  had</span><span>  jumped  to  38s.  per  100  lbs.  no  assist</span><span>  ance  was  necessary.  That  it  has  since</span><span>  slumped  by  nearly  50  per  cent  should</span><span>  at  least  induce  Mr.  Forde  to  break  his</span><span>  long  silence.  Instead,  he  confer?</span><span>  meekly  with  his  union  bosses.</span><span>  Sheep  men  would  be  glad  to  hear  from</span><span>  Mr.  Forda  He  voted  on  18th  Decem</span><span>  ber,  1930,  in  favour  of  an  export  duty</span></p> <p><span>  of  3d.  per  lb.  on  sheep  skins,  although</span><span>  the  Tariff  Board  had  strongly  condem</span><span>  ned  the  scheme,  and  suggested  instead</span><span>  a  bounty  of  Ad.  per  lb.  on  felhnongerod</span><span>  skins.  In  three  months  about  £13,500</span><span>  of  tax  had  been  collected,  and  export  of</span><span>  sheep  skins  of  almost  all  kinds  had</span><span>  practically  ceased.  Then  the  duty  was</span><span>  lifted,  and  it  is  left  to  exporters  to  re</span><span>  establish  friendly  relations  with  their</span><span>  previous  clients.  But  sheep  men  in  the</span><span>  meantime  aro  paying  in  lost  sales  and</span><span>  decreased  revenue  because  Mr.  Forde  is</span><span>  -  more  solicitous  for  his  political  skin</span><span>  than  for  their  sheep  pelts.</span><span>  Primary  producers  generally  would</span><span>  like  to  hear  from  Mr.  Forde.

That  is  to  Eay,</span><span>  for  every  £10*0  of  Australian  valuation</span><span>  we  have  borrowed'  £82,  and  the  outcry</span><span>  against  the  financial  system  seems  to</span><span>  rest  on  no  sounder  basis  than  that  our</span><span>  creditors  will  not  advance'the  other  £18.</span><span>  Our  politicians  have  indicated  their</span><span>  willingness  to  borrow,  some  of  them</span><span>  have  announced  their  deep-rooted  abhor</span><span>  rence  toward,  paying  back,  and  most  of</span><span>  them  have  agreed  that  local  lenders</span><span>  must  be  satisfied  with  less  return  for</span><span>  their  money  than  it  was  solemnly  agreed</span><span>  would  be  given  them.  Politically,  the</span><span>  charge  against  the  present  monetary</span><span>  system  stands  on  a  sound  basis.  The</span><span>  system  is  exhausted  and  another  must</span><span>  be  found.  We  have  borrowed  every</span><span>  thing  borrowable  on  this  planet,  so</span><span>  must  look  further  afield.</span><span>  In  point  of  fact,  the  financial  system</span><span>  is  no  more  to  blame  than  would  be  the</span><span>  high  explosives  .  or  outraged  gas  main.</span><span>  Treated  with  due.  respect  to  their  essen</span><span>  tial  qualities  and  prospective  functions,</span><span>  th.ey  all  tend,  to  add  to  the  prosperity</span><span>  and  welfare  of  man.  But  all  of  them</span><span>  exact  fearful  toll  when  mishandled  by</span><span>  fools  or  blundering  incompetents.  No</span><span>  human,  institution  is  foolproof,  and</span><span>  none  which  depend  for  stability  upon</span><span>  good  faith  and  high  purpose  can  stand</span><span>  for  long  the  assaults  of  the  knave  or</span><span>  the  mountebank.</span><span>  On  much  the  same  basis  of  reason</span><span>  ing  it  is  stated  that  arbitration  has</span><span>  failed.  It  failed  because  no  instrument</span><span>  that  can  be  devised  by  the  wit  of  'man</span><span>  could  have  survived  repeated  breaches</span><span>  of  faith  which  are  so  prominent  a  fea</span><span>  ture  of  the  history  of  arbi</span></p> <p><span>  tration  in  Australia.  Solemn  enact</span><span>  ments  and  agreements  have  their</span><span>  very  roots  in  fidelity  in  the  -individual,</span><span>  and  faith  in  the  nation.  Yet  we  have</span><span>  seen  men  who  occupy  some  of  -the</span><span>  highest  administrative  positions  in  ,  the</span><span>  land  actively  supporting  betrayals  of</span><span>  such  trust,  and  leading-  the  mob  against</span><span>  the  restraints  of  arbitration.  The  boons</span><span>  and  blessings  of  arbitration  have  been</span><span>  thrown  to  the  pack,  its  behests  ridiculed,</span><span>  and  its  powers  flouted,  and  there  are</span><span>  still  men  who  affect  -surprise  at  arbitra</span><span>  tion  having  failed.</span><span>  Excepting  for  a  few  lusty  aspirants</span><span>  who  [climbed  to  affluence  on  the  backs</span><span>  of  the  worker,  unionism  has  failed.  It</span><span>  neither  created  «,  new  industry  nor  fos</span><span>  tered  an  established  one  in  the  whole</span><span>  of  its  history  in  Australia.  .  Gathering</span><span>  an  income  in  normal  years  of  over</span><span>  '£i,OQO,000  »er  annum,  it  has  used  its</span><span>  power  to  destroy,  and  used*  the  contribu</span><span>  tions  of  workers  to  wipe  out  the  employ</span><span>  ment  of  those  workers.  Outside  of  its  ad</span><span>  ministration  and  propaganda,  unionism</span><span>  kas^not  employed  a  single  worker,  not</span><span>  has  it  added  anything  to  the  wealth  of</span><span>  the  natiop.  Rather  has  it,  through  its</span></p> <p><span>  exactions,  its'  persecutions,  and  its  re</span><span>  pressions,  closed  avenues  through  which  ?</span><span>  new  wealth  might  have  been  won,  as</span><span>  well  as  broken  the  threads  of  external</span><span>  commerce  which,  twenty  years  ago,</span><span>  brought  wealth  to  the  nation  and  main,</span><span>  tained  our  status  abroad.  Neither  has</span><span>  unionism  induced  industrial  peace.</span><span>  Measured  in  terms  of  wages  alone,  the</span><span>  loss  to  workers  through  fomented</span><span>  strikes—  many  of  them  illegal  —  has  run</span><span>  into  millions  of  pounds  per  annum.  In</span><span>  terms  of  loss  through  dislocation  of  busi</span><span>  ness,  -  deterioration  of  goods,  and  lost</span><span>  markets  the  toll  is  even  greater.  But</span><span>  union  managers  are  concerned  in  none</span><span>  of  these.  To  them  the  union  is  'iut</span><span>  the  stepping  stone  to  Parliament.  At</span><span>  the  present  time  there  are  four  A.W.U.</span><span>  officials  in  the  Cabinet  of  the  Federal</span><span>  Parliament,  four  union  officials  in  that</span><span>  of  the  New  South  Wales  and  Victorian</span><span>  Pariaments,  and  six  in  South  Aus</span><span>  tralia.  To  these  eighteen  men  unionism</span><span>  is  something  radically  different  from</span><span>  what  it  represents  to  the  growing  army</span><span>  of  unemployed  unionists.  With  these</span><span>  exceptions,  and  also  because  unionism</span><span>  keeps  herded  together  workers  in  key</span><span>  industries  so  that  they  fall  easy  prey</span><span>  to  Communistic  influence,  unionism  has</span><span>  failed.</span><span>  Thus,  the  extent  to  which  an  institu</span><span>  tion  breaks  down  depends  in  the  main</span><span>  upon  the  extent  to  which  human  effort</span><span>  has  been  directed  that  way.  In  the</span><span>  whole  of  the  instances  cited  it  is  the</span><span>  abuse  which  brought  failure  to  institu</span><span>  tions  intended  for  use  and  service.  A</span><span>  man  may  perish  from  either  thirst  and</span><span>  drowning,  in  one  case  from  too  little,</span><span>  and  in  the  other  from  too  much  water.</span><span>  It  was'  possible,  in  the  hands  of  men  of</span><span>  stability,  for  our  present  financial  sys.</span><span>  tern,  arbitration  and  unionism  to  confer</span><span>  lasting  benefits  upon  the  nation.  But</span><span>  they  fell  into  the  hands  of  knaves  and</span><span>  fools,  and  to  that  must  be.  ascribed  the</span><span>  measure  of  their  failure.</span></p> ",Article,1931-12-03,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

His</span><span>  6adneBs  was  that  of  the  circus  master</span><span>  in  whose  sorry  troupe  patrons  had  .lost</span><span>  Viterest,  and  who  was  confronted  with</span><span>  the  task,  of  producing  a  fresh  playbill</span></p> <p><span>  and  -concealing  .  past  shortcomings</span><span>  with,  no  new  material  for  the  one,  and</span><span>  no  hope  of  burying  the  other.  Like  the</span><span>  Israelites  of  old,  whose  taskmasters  im-,</span><span>  pressed  them  into  the  homely  and  hope</span><span>  -lcss  task  of  making  bricks  without</span><span>  straw,  the  depressed  Prime  Minister</span><span>  of  Australia  is  confronted  with  the</span><span>  tliankiesB  task  of  inducing  trust  where</span><span>  only  suspicion  exists,  and  fcrgetfulnesB</span><span>  of  the  past  where  people  look  for  hope</span><span>  in  the  future.</span><span>  In  the  course  of  his  lugubrious  re</span><span>  marks,  James  Henry.  Scullin  said,  dis</span><span>  mally,  that  the  Government's  main  pur</span><span>  pose  in  the  last  two  years  had  been  to</span><span>  stave  off  disaster.  His  sadness  at  this</span><span>  juncture  may.  be  due,  to  the  fact  that</span><span>  the  '  most  strenuous  advocacy  of  disaster</span><span>  cam©  from  the,  Federal  Labour  Caucus,</span><span>  and  that  .had.  not  the  Prime  Minister</span><span>  had  the  support  of  the  Senate,  disaster</span><span>  would  have  been  forced  -inevitably  on</span><span>  Australia.  That  lie  has  cause  for</span><span>  dejection  is  evident,  because  the  caucuB</span><span>  that  urged  acts  which  would  precipitate</span><span>  disaster  is  '  the  same  caucus  which  will</span><span>  be  fighting  Mr.  Scullin's  election  battle.</span><span>  He  therefore  must  promise  to  hurry  on</span><span>  the  disaster  he  claims  to  have  prevented,</span><span>  and  rely  on  his  opponents  preventing</span><span>  him  —  if  returned  —  working  Mb  own  dire</span><span>  purpose.  Few  men  should'  be  so  grate</span><span>  ful  to  their  opponents  as  James  Henry</span><span>  Scullin,  because  few  men  stand  in  such</span><span>  awe  of  their  supporters.</span><span>  Proceeding,  in  extreme  townees  of</span><span>  spirits,  James  Henry  .  Scullin  stated</span><span>  that:  .  '</span><span>  'They  must  bring  .  together  the</span><span>  best  brains  of  public-spirited  men  in</span><span>  all  walks  of  life  to  Advise  and  assist</span><span>  in  the  work  of  reconstruction.  '  '</span><span>  Edward  Granville  Theodore,  high  priest</span><span>  of  the  empty  Treasury  and  first  lieuten</span><span>  ant  to  the  lamentable  and  lamenting</span><span>  Scullin,  stated  recently  in  Sydney  that</span><span>  there  can  be  in  modern  society  no  com</span><span>  plete  identity  of  interests,  no  enduring</span><span>  peace.  '  The  circus  master  says,  there</span><span>  muitftp  a  pooling  of  .  intellect  in  the</span><span>  national  cause,  but  his  chief  of  staff,</span><span>  announces  .  such  coalition  :to  be  out  of</span><span>  tha  question.  Janiee  Henry  Scul|in  had</span><span>  himself  rejected  suggestions  or.  pro</span><span>  posals  for  a  coalition  government,,  and</span><span>  now  states  that  without  such/  coalition</span><span>  or  co-operation  the.  nation  is  doomed.</span><span>  He  begs  now  for  the  help  he  previously</span><span>  scorned,  and  his  Treasurer  also  has</span><span>  announced  his  contempt  for  the  .  sugges</span><span>  .tion.  ?</span><span>  Turning  to  yet  weightier  matters,  the</span><span>  apostle  of  gloom  stated  that  'The  great</span><span>  hope'  for-  Australia  in  the  future  lies</span><span>  in  the  intensive  cultivation  of  the  land.  '</span><span>  He  had  previously  stated  that  it';  lay</span><span>  in  a  tariff  policy  'which  was  designed</span><span>  to  save-  the  nation  from  collapse.''  He</span><span>  thus  'subscribes  to  a-  policy  of  taxing</span><span>  our  way  to  prosperity,  where  the</span><span>  primary  producer  is  taxed  to  find</span><span>  employment  (at  rates  of  which  he  kiiows</span><span>  none  of  the  joys)  in  secondary  indus</span><span>  tries  that  show  no  signs  of  standing</span><span>  alone,  and  *  never  will.  The  real  hppo</span><span>  for  Australia-r^the  primary  producerr</span><span>  muet  be  taxed  to  provide  -  for,.  a  Iwgufl</span><span>  hope  in  certain  secondary  industries  that</span><span>  it  would  be.  advantageous  to  Australia</span><span>  to  pension  off.  James  Henry  Scullin</span><span>  has-  two  ragged  -strings  to  hU  futile</span><span>  bow,  each  of  which  is  pulling  against</span><span>  the  other.  He  also  has'  ardent  dis</span><span>  ciples  who  argue  that  it  is  a  benevolent</span><span>  policy  to  pay  £300  for  goods  made  in</span><span>  Australia  when  the  same  goods  could</span><span>  be  imported,  for  f  100,  but  even  he  was</span><span>  not  very  cheerful  -  on  the  subject'  when</span><span>  making  his  appeal-^-or  apology—  to  the*</span><span>  nation  on  Tuesday  Nni(^it  last,  ;)  1</span><span>  .

But  of  all  people,</span><span>  a  Treasurer  for  a  natibn  should  have</span><span>  views  sufficiently  stable  on  so  important</span><span>  a,  point  to  withstand  the  passage  of</span><span>  time  and  pressure  of  Caucus.  It  is  not</span><span>  necessarily  suggested  that  Caucus  is</span><span>  responsible  for  the  fluidity  of  his  views</span><span>  on  inflation,  bui  it  is  suggested,  and</span><span>  most  seriously,  that  the  matter  of</span><span>  currency  .  inflation  is  not  one  on  which</span><span>  to  express  warm  approval  one  week,</span><span>  and  cold  disfavour  the*  week  following.</span><span>  In  an  ingenious  effort  to  extract  com</span><span>  fort  from  the  past,  our  mournful  Prime</span><span>  Minister  stated  that,  inflation  warnings</span><span>  followed  the  establishment  by  Andrew</span><span>  Fisher  of  the  Commonwealth  Bank  and</span><span>  the  introduction  of  Commonwealth  notes,</span><span>  but  no  inflation  had  followed.  Again</span><span>  James  Henry  Scullin  expressed  confidence</span><span>  in,  and  admiration  for,  his  opponents,  who</span><span>  held  power  for  thirteen  but  of  the  seven</span><span>  teen  years  that  elapsed  from  the  time</span><span>  the  Commonwealth  Bank  was  established</span><span>  until  the  Scullin  exponents  of  finance</span><span>  gained,  the  Treasury  benches  in  1920.</span><span>  He  could  lave  commended  further  his</span><span>  opponents  by  announcing  that,  until  that</span><span>  year  of  disgrace,  the  integrity  and</span><span>  status  of  the  Commonwealth  Bank  were</span><span>  not  assailed.  Nor  was  there  previously</span><span>  any  such  insistent  demand  for  the  bank</span><span>  to,  'create'  credits,  or  to  vacate  recog</span><span>  nised  and  proper  systems  of  banking.</span><span>  The  Lyonists  and'  Pageites  should  be</span><span>  deeply  grateful  to  the  sad  man  at  Rich</span><span>  mond.  Unable  to  say  much  on  his  own</span><span>  behalf  he  said  much,  on  theirs.

Nor  is  there  any</span><span>  thing  in  it  by  which  all  or  any  of  the</span><span>  six  States  forming  the  Commonwealth</span><span>  of  Australia  can  take  action  either  in</span><span>  their  own  defence  or  for  the  disciplining</span><span>  of  a  national  government  that  has  gone</span><span>  temporarily  mad.</span><span>  This  explains  why  it  is  that  full-dress</span><span>  conferences  galore  have  been  attended</span><span>  by  heads  of  governments  of  the  different</span><span>  States,  why  their  solemn  deliberations</span><span>  have  been  just  aB  often  tossed  aside  as</span><span>  soon  as  conference  broke  up,  and  also</span><span>  why  the  several  States  continue  at</span><span>  great  cost  to  send  their  representatives</span><span>  along  to  the  discredited  gatherings.</span><span>  There  is  a  wild  and  vagrant  hope  that</span><span>  out  of  the  interminable  wranglings  be</span><span>  tween  the  sleight-of-hand  artists  who</span><span>  form  the  government,  and  their  caucus</span><span>  bosses,  there  may  emerge  a  vestige  of</span><span>  Eanity  upon  which  might  be  built  the</span><span>  restoration  of  our  shattered  fortunes.</span><span>  There  also  is  a  shadowy  belief  that  the</span><span>  presence  of  the  States  induces  a  mea</span><span>  sure  of  restraint  that  otherwise  would</span><span>  be  non-existent.  Anything  more  piti</span><span>  able  than  this  continued  hope  of  the</span><span>  States,  and  the  persistence  with  which</span><span>  the  Federal  Government  destroys  that</span><span>  hope,  is  difficult  to  imagine.</span><span>  In  its  briefest  terms,  the  policy  of</span><span>  the  Federal  jugglers  is  that  we  demand</span><span>  to  be  saved  from  the  consequences  of</span><span>  our  foolishness.  We  demand  also  that</span><span>  we  retain  the  foolishness,  and  that  our</span><span>  creditors  make  the  sacrifices  that  right</span><span>  ly  are  ours.  Lang  insists,  however,  that</span><span>  the  creditor  carry  the  burden  of  even</span><span>  more  extravagant  foolishness,  and  both</span><span>  he  and  Scullin  insolently  trumpet  their</span><span>  braggart  claim  that  whatever  burdens</span><span>  we  may  impose  on  our  creditors,  we  are</span><span>  to  bear  none  ourselves.  We  may  de</span><span>  fault  and  pay  our  overseas  creditors</span><span>  nothing,  but  we  will  not  brook  the  in</span><span>  sult  of  'interference'  from  anyone,  evei</span><span>  where  such  'interference'  really  is  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  form  of  friendly  and  valuable  coun</span><span>  sel.</span><span>  We  demand  the  same  absurd  'stand-</span><span>  ard  of  living'  for  our  organised  work</span><span>  ers,  even  though  during  peak  seasons</span><span>  of  prosperity  there  is  no  such  standard</span><span>  for  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Australian</span><span>  workers  who  are  not  members  of</span><span>  unions.  We  demand  that  single  adults</span><span>  be  paid  upwards  of  £100,000,000  annu</span><span>  ally  for  the  support  of  wives  and  child</span><span>  ren  who  do  not  exist.  W©  claim  ihe</span><span>  right  to  work,  and  the  right  to  loaf,</span><span>  with  no  corresponding  diminution  in  the</span><span>  pay  envelope  at  the  week-end.  We  are</span><span>  tax-riddled  and  tariff-mad,  while  the</span><span>  itch  to  interfere  in  every  form  of  indus</span><span>  try,  to  regulate  the  universe  and  con</span><span>  trol  the  seasons  has  made  of  us  the</span><span>  most  scientifically  strangled  people  on</span><span>  the  face  of  the  globe.  All  of  these  and</span></p> <p><span>  innumerable  other  insanities  the  Federal</span><span>  jugglers  want  to  retain.  They  want</span><span>  also  to  impose  the  cost  of  them  upon</span><span>  anyone  at  all  who  is  not  capable  of</span><span>  voting  back,  and  ^in  their  squirmings</span><span>  and  twistings  to  bring  this  about  they</span><span>  have  blackened  the  Australian  national</span><span>  character,  and  branded  us  a  race  of</span><span>  mountebanks.</span><span>  America,  by  no  means  a  stickler  for</span><span>  the  finer  points  of  national  etiquette,</span><span>  has  leached  the  stage  where  she  disbe</span><span>  lieves  our  press  cables,  and  awaits  her</span><span>  private  letter  mail  for  full  and  unvar</span><span>  nished  particulars  of  our  financial  and</span><span>  moral  declension.  Also,  the  gentle</span><span>  Fijian  denounces  our  paper,  is  not  en</span><span>  thusiastic  about  our  silver,  and  gene</span><span>  rally  shows  his  contempt  by  indicating</span><span>  that  ho  could  get  on  very  well  without</span><span>  us  in  any  case.</span><span>  To  ask  when  the  dreadful  travesty  of</span><span>  government  is  to  end  is  to  ask  when</span><span>  the  juggler  will  tire  of  his  spangles  and</span><span>  tinsel,  the  quack  desert  his  empirical</span><span>  nostrums,  and  the  mountebank  abanlon</span><span>  his  pea  and  thimble  for  the  sober  but  un</span><span>  imposing  role  of  honest  effort.  Wild</span><span>  and  extravagant  as  they  are,  they  still</span><span>  are  the  elect  of  the  people,  and  only</span><span>  the  people  can  end  their  sorry  reign.</span><span>  Constitutionally,  there,  is  no  escape</span><span>  for  the  States  from  the  inevitable</span><span>  smash  ahead.  From  a  cominon  sense</span><span>  point  of  view,  the  State  which  is  drawn</span><span>  unwillingly  into  the  crash  that  the</span><span>  jugglers  at  Canberra  seem  intent  upon</span><span>  bringing  about  is  governed  by  weak</span><span>  lings.

To</span><span>  Lacco  and  flax  have  had  woven  round</span><span>  them  some  of  the  most  alluring  pros</span></p> <p><span>  pects  of  the  age,  the  general  principle</span><span>  in  all  cases  being  much  the  same.  The</span><span>  public  were  asked  to  purchase  bonds</span><span>  covering  a  specific  area  of  land  to  be</span><span>  placed  under  special  cultivation,  and</span><span>  were  assured  of  phenomenal  returns  for</span><span>  their  outlay.  For  security,  portion  of</span><span>  the  public's  money  was  set  aside  in</span><span>  ft  trust  fund,  and,  in  most  cases,  the</span><span>  Seeds  of  the  land  were  deposited  with</span><span>  tie  trustee.  The  public  thus  provided</span><span>  Its  own  security,  to  which  the  bond  sell</span><span>  ing  company  added  the  deeds  of  land  of</span><span>  problematical  value.  On  the  face  of  it,</span><span>  the  possibilities  of  bond-sellers  doing</span><span>  better  than  bond-holders  depended  upon</span><span>  freaking  the  bond  cost  high  enough  and</span><span>  getting  land  cheap  enough.  To  a  bond</span><span>  polling  company  bent  upon  spoils  the</span><span>  fcnargin  left  would  be  considerable!  and</span><span>  foot  likely  to  be  seriously  diminished</span><span>  by  any  undertakings  made  by  it  to</span><span>  ?'  develop'  the  land  for  the  bondhold</span><span>  ers.</span><span>  Another  feature  is  that  tlie  phenome</span><span>  hal  returns  promised  by  bond-selling</span><span>  Concerns  depend  upon  a  reversal  of  the</span><span>  frrell-known  maxim  that  a  company</span><span>  bever  farms  as  well  for  share  (or  bond)</span><span>  {?olders  as  individual  farmers  do  for</span><span>  themselves.  There  are  many  vital  ele</span><span>  teents  in  fighting  seasonal  drawbacks,</span><span>  insect  and  animal  pests,  and  diseases</span><span>  fef  all  kinds  that  cannot  be  overcome</span><span>  by  even  the  most  ornate  prospectus.</span><span>  The  practical  conditions  of  soil  tilling</span><span>  Are  as  far  removed  from  the  conditions</span><span>  tasually  set  out  in  such  prospectuses</span><span>  fes  the  compiler  of  that  ingenious  docu</span><span>  ment  is  from  the  practical  farmer.  The</span><span>  former  reckons  income  from  land  opera</span><span>  tions  in  arithmetical  progression.  The</span><span>  latter  counts  it  in  the  cash  he  has  left</span><span>  fefter  fighting  every  known  peet,  sur</span><span>  viving  droughts  and-  floods,  and  dispos</span><span>  ing  of  his  output  on  a  falling  (or  fallen)</span><span>  fcnarket.</span><span>  A  bond  proposal  now  before  the  pub</span><span>  lic  is  that  of  Rugen  Harbour  Planta</span><span>  tions,  Ltd.,  Xew  Britain,  with</span><span>  1000  bonds  at  £22  10s.  each,</span><span>  giving  the  'right  to  the  free</span><span>  hold  title  to  half  an  undivided</span><span>  acre  properly  planted  with  tropical  pro</span><span>  ducts  under  the  latest  and  most  scien</span><span>  tific  methods.'  Bonds  may  be  paid  up</span><span>  on  application,  when  interest  at  the  ratj</span><span>  of  7  per  cent,  per  annum,  will  be  paid</span><span>  for  four  years,  when  it  is  anticipated</span><span>  that  income  from  the  plantations  will</span><span>  be  available  for  dividends.  The  bonds</span><span>  are  also  available  on  terms  over  a  period</span><span>  of  21  and  36  months,  when  interest  on</span><span>  the  whole  amount  is  paid  for  the  bal</span><span>  ance  of  the  four  years  period.  In  the</span><span>  absence  of  information,  to  the  contrary,</span><span>  the  bond-  selling  company  contemplates</span><span>  paying  back  to  bondholders  part  of</span><span>  their  own  capital  as  interest,  in  which</span><span>  case  the  company  could  have  collected</span><span>  less  from  the  bondholders  in  the  first</span><span>  place,  stating  that  no  dividends  could</span><span>  be  expected  for  four  years.  On  projects</span><span>  of  this  description  no  reasonable  person</span><span>  expects  a  dividend  any  sooner  —  if  as</span><span>  Boon.</span><span>  In  one  portion  of  the  prospectus  it  is</span><span>  stated  this  interest  obligation  will  be</span><span>  met  from  funds  lodged  with  the  trustee</span><span>  'adequate,  in  his  opinion,'  for  this  pur</span><span>  ?  pose.  In  another  part  the  prospectus</span><span>  states  that  £4  10s.  per  bond  will  be  de</span><span>  posited  with  such  trustee  to  pay  (a)  his</span><span>  fees,  costs  and  expenses,  (b)  the  7  per</span><span>  cent,  interest  up  to  the  end  of  four</span><span>  years  ;  (c)  outstanding  balance  of  pur</span><span>  chase  money  of  the  land  (amount  un</span><span>  specified)  ;  cost  of  erection  of  mill,</span><span>  plant  and  equipment  ;  (c)  expenses  of</span><span>  ballot  of  bondholders  ;  and  (f  )-  work</span><span>  ing  capital  of  bondholders'  company.  At</span><span>  £4  10s.  per  bond  the  sum  available  for</span><span>  this  ambitious  programme  would  be</span><span>  £4500,  considering  that  interest  alone</span><span>  at  7  per  cent,  on  £22,500  would  eat</span><span>  up  £1575  per  annum.</span><span>  For  its  part,  the  bond-selling  com</span><span>  pany  'contracts  to  plant,  cultivate  and</span><span>  maintain  (the  area)  until  December</span><span>  3Ut,  1034,  to  the  satisfaction  of  the</span><span>  Executive  Trustee.'  This  official  is  u</span><span>  Sydney  chartered  accountant,  whose</span><span>  knowledge  of  pioneering  a  tropical  plan</span></p> <p><span>  tation  probably  is  not  extensive.  Also,</span><span>  his  active  supervision  from  Sydney  of</span><span>  work  of  this  description  in  New  Britain</span><span>  £4500  and  interest  alone  at  7  per  cent</span><span>  on  £22,500  would  eat  up  £1575  per  an</span><span>  num.</span><span>  The  company  sets  at  the  head  of  its</span><span>  operations  the  cultivation  of  coffee,  de</span><span>  spita  the  fact  that  Australians  do  not</span><span>  drink  coffee,  that  Brazil  has  more  than</span><span>  sufficient  on  hand  to  supply  the  rest  of</span><span>  the  world,  and  without  taking  into  ac</span><span>  count  the  coffee  leaf  disease  (Hemileia</span><span>  vastatrix)  which  ruined  the  coffee  indus</span><span>  try  in  Ceylon.  The  experiences  of</span><span>  Queensland  in  this  connection  also</span><span>  might  be  taken  into  account.  She  has</span><span>  grown  coffee  for  more  than  30  years,</span><span>  and  her  acreage  has  fallen  from  547  in</span><span>  1901-2  to  seven  acres  in  1929.  Incident</span><span>  ally,  her  average  yield  per  acre  over</span><span>  the  last  ten  years  was  653  lbs.,  against</span><span>  24  cwt.  mentioned  in  the  prospectus  un</span><span>  der  review.  The  contention  may  be  that</span><span>  Queensland  has  but  proved  that  she  can</span><span>  not  grow  coffee,  while  New  Britain  is</span><span>  out  to  prove  that  she  can.</span><span>  The  oil  palm  is  next  mentioned,  and</span><span>  as  there  were  in  the  whole  of  New</span><span>  Guinea  territory  only  20  acres  under</span><span>  this  palm  in  1929,  it  is  obvious  that</span><span>  much  remains  to  be  known  about  it.  The</span><span>  oil  palm  (Elaeis  guineensis)  is  a  slow</span><span>  grower,  and  takes  10  to  12  years  to</span><span>  come  into  bearing.  Its  natural  habitat</span><span>  Is  the  Gulf  of  Guinea  (Africa),  but  five</span><span>  or  so  years  ago  it  was  found  that  Su</span><span>  matra  plantations  threatened  the  indus</span><span>  try  in  British  West  Africa.  If  the  in</span><span>  tention  is  to  develop  under  company</span><span>  conditions  in  New  Britain  that  which</span><span>  could  not  be  retained  under  West  Afri</span><span>  can  conditions,  the  optimism  of  the  di</span><span>  rectors  of  Rugen  Harbour  Plantations,</span><span>  Ltd.,  is  such  as  to  warrant  giving  more</span><span>  liberal  terms  to  the  bondholders.</span><span>  Cocoa  is  the  third  string,  of  which</span><span>  there  were  578  acres  growing  in  the  New</span><span>  Guinea  territory  in  1929,  the  average</span><span>  yield  per  acre  being  3.5  cwts.,  against</span><span>  'from  5  cwt.  to  8  cwt.'  mentioned  in</span><span>  the  prospectus.  The  exports  from  the</span><span>  territory  were  72  tons,  at  an  average</span><span>  value  of  £53  per  ton.  A  bounty  of  lid.</span><span>  per  lb.  brings  it  up  to  £67,  and  on  the</span><span>  average  yield  means  a  gross  return  of</span><span>  £11  15s.  per  acre.  These  figures  do</span><span>  not  agree  with  the  prospectus,  but  we</span><span>  did  not  compile  that  document.</span><span>  The  three  commodities  mentioned  pro</span><span>  vide  excellent  reasons  for  asking  for</span><span>  further  and  more  specific  information  on</span><span>  these  subjects  than  is  at  present  sup</span><span>  plied  in  the  prospectus.

Europe  was  pretty  well  occu</span><span>  pied  with  her  own  affairs,  so  that  the</span><span>  somewhat  grandiloquent  statement  of</span><span>  Monroe  passed  into  a  national  doctrine</span></p> <p><span>  mainly  because  no  European  power,'</span><span>  the  time  challenged  it.</span><span>  ?With  the  development  of  the  United</span><span>  States,  the  Monroe  Doctrine  came  to.</span><span>  mean  manv  things  at  different  times,</span><span>  although  it  by  the  same  process  be</span><span>  came  ultimately  the  text  of  America's</span><span>  foreign  policy.  Not  only  did  it  exclude</span><span>  Suroptjan  powers  from  gaining  a  foot</span><span>  hold  on  the  American  continent,  but  it</span><span>  came  al«o  to  mean  that  America  held</span><span>  herself  aloof  from  the  effects  of  Euro</span><span>  pean  politics.  She  aimed  at  complete</span><span>  political  isolation.

Repeated  ?  suggestions  that</span><span>  she  might  regard  more  humanly  the  in</span><span>  tolerable  war.  burdens  —  many  of  them</span><span>  form  her  own  citizens—  fell  on  unheed</span></p> <p><span>  ing  ears.  According  to  our  caDies,  we</span><span>  President  of  the  United!

Germany  is  on  the</span><span>  verge  of  financial  disaster  and!  undoub</span><span>  tedly  would  have  defaulted  in  any  case.</span><span>  Bo  unbalanced  a  condition  as  has  been</span><span>  brought  about  by  America's  policy  of</span><span>  splendid  isolation  could  not  remain  un</span><span>  adjusted.  It  threatened1  not  only  the</span><span>  shattered  nations,  -  but  also  the  secu</span><span>  rity  of  the  nation  which  brought  it</span><span>  about.  She  has  built  up  a  Franken</span><span>  stein  which  will  destroy  ;  her.  and  has</span></p> <p><span>  attracted  a  stream  of  gold  which  will</span><span>  overthrow  all  her  preconceived  ideas  on</span><span>  foreign  policy.  She  holds  in  her  vaults</span><span>  many  millions  of  pounds'  worth-  of  gold</span><span>  for  which  ehe  can  find!  no  domestic  em»</span><span>  ployment,  and  her  national  selfishness</span><span>  has  impoverished  nations  who  were  po</span><span>  tential  customers.  The  mysterious  gold</span><span>  loan  of  £15,000,000  to  Australia  prob</span><span>  ably  has  its  genesis  in  America.  It</span><span>  earns  nothing  where  it  is,  and  if  the</span><span>  gold  will  help  stabilise  another  .wobbly</span><span>  debtor  and  at  the  same  time  earn  four</span><span>  per  cent  there  is  little  doubt  about  an</span><span>  American  financier  being  more  discern</span><span>  ing  than  an  American  politician.</span></p> <p><span>  The  suggested  moratorium  thus  was</span><span>  is  inevitable  as  it  is  welcome.

After</span><span>  considering  various  applications  from</span><span>  lessees  and  selectors  for  concessions,</span><span>  eighteen  applications  were  granted,  oa</span><span>  the  condition  that  specified  numbers</span><span>  of  rams  were  supplied  annually  by  eacb</span><span>  lessee,  the  total  of  which  amounted  to</span><span>  approximately  14,000.  Some  years  will</span><span>  elapse,  of  course,  .before  the  studs  actu</span><span>  ally  reach  this  point  of  production,  but</span><span>  already  their  annual  offering  of  rams</span><span>  in  increasing,  especially  in  Central</span><span>  '  Queensland,  where  the  majority  of  these</span><span>  holdings  are  located.</span><span>  The  foundation  of  a  stud  .  entails</span><span>  heavy  expenditure  through  the  outlay</span><span>  of  capital  in  the  initial  sheep  purchase,</span><span>  the  heavy  working  expenses,  and  .  the</span><span>  small  number  of  'sheep  which  can  safely</span><span>  be  carried  on  the  pastures.  Even  in</span><span>  past  periods,  during  which  high  prices</span><span>  were  obtainable  for  stud  and  flock  rants,</span><span>  it  took  a  long  time  to  build  up  a  suc</span><span>  cessful  stud,  because  of  the  necessity</span><span>  for  many  roars  of  specialised  effort  and</span><span>  the  handicap  of  small  returns  under</span><span>  which  owners  laboured  over  the  initial</span><span>  period.  But  a  continuance  of  present</span><span>  conditions  governing  the  industry  will</span><span>  make  successful  establishment  even</span><span>  more  'difficult,  as  ram  values  have  fallen</span><span>  approximately  50  per  cent.,  and  in  ad</span><span>  dition  the  competition  from  the  New</span><span>  South  Wales  studs  has  become  so  in</span><span>  tense  that  it  is  difficult  for  the  local</span><span>  stu-Js  to  effect  sufficient  sales.</span><span>  Until  a  few  years  ago  pastoralists  de</span><span>  siring  to  purchase  rams  were  compelled</span><span>  to  visit  the  various  studs  or  else  the</span><span>  rain  auctions  in  Brisbane  and  Sydney,</span><span>  and  after  securing  their  requirements</span><span>  they  had  to  incur  all  the  transit  and</span><span>  handling  charges  necessary  to  land  the</span><span>  rams  safely  on  their  properties.  But</span><span>  with  the  stringent  financial  conditions</span><span>  which  have  prevailed  recently,  there</span><span>  has  been  a  marked  reduction  in  demand,</span><span>  and  on  top  of  this  came  the  Government</span><span>  embargo  on  the  export  of  stud  sheep</span><span>  from  Australia/  so  that  the  larger  studs</span><span>  in  New  South  Wales  have  found  diffi</span><span>  culty  in  marketing  their  annual  drafts</span><span>  of  rams.  Accordingly,  they  have  adop</span><span>  ted  the  plan  of  establishing  depots  'in</span><span>  various  districts  of  Queensland  in  an</span><span>  endeavour  to  dispose  of  their  rams,  and</span><span>  -n  addition  auctions  have  been  held  at</span><span>  Longreach.  When  it  is  considered  that</span><span>  last  year  the  offerings  at  the  Longreach'</span><span>  sales  totalled  about  800  and  the  sales</span><span>  held  this  month  saw  the  figures  increased</span><span>  .  to  over  2000,  it  can  be  seen  that  their</span><span>  efforts  are  meeting  with  a  large  mea</span><span>  sure  of  success  from  the  point  of  view</span><span>  of  quitting'  their  products.  The  next'</span><span>  annual  sale  there  will  in  all  probability</span><span>  comprise  about  4000  rams  in  the  cata</span><span>  logues.  The  real  task  will  not  be  to</span><span>  secure  consignments  of  rams  for  the</span><span>  sale,  but  tp  confine  offerings  to  reason</span><span>  able  dimensions,  and  whilst  no  doubt</span><span>  i  purchasers  will  be  able  to  secure  their</span><span>  requirements  handy  to  their  properties</span><span>  at  very  loy  prices,  it  is  certain  that</span><span>  values  will  be  unprofitable  for  the  ven</span><span>  dors.  The  wejl-established  Southern</span><span>  studs  will  welcome1  the  opportunity  of</span><span>  disposing  of  their  surplus  .  rams  at  this</span><span>  Bide,  but  the  Queensland  stud  owner*</span><span>  will  generally  be  in  a  less  fortunate</span><span>  position,  subject  as  they  are  to  heavy</span><span>  outlay  during  their  initial  periods  and</span><span>  in  need  'of  more  profitable  prices.</span><span>  It  has  been  estimated  that  in  normal</span><span>  seasons  Queensland  needs  about  50,000</span><span>  ram*  annually,  of  which  the  greater</span><span>  proportion  '  are  required  in  the  Central</span><span>  District.  The  studs  cannot  produce  this</span><span>  number  locally,  even  if  they  were  to</span><span>  breed  their  full  quota  according  to  the</span><span>  Land  Board's  conditions..  in  the.  case  of</span><span>  the  newer  studs,  and  of  the  older  Queens</span><span>  land  establishments  maintain  their  cus</span><span>  tomary  output.  Altogether'  Queens</span><span>  land's  production  should  be  in  the.  vici-</span><span>  nity  of  20,000  merino  rams  annually,  so</span><span>  that  large  numbers  will  be  needed  from</span><span>  Sew  South  Wales  in  the  future.  The</span><span>  point  about  the  present  situation  ,is,</span><span>  hzstet,  fiat  jfceii  i|  *n»waSfc«ft</span></p> <p><span>  I  limit  to  the  competition  offered  foy  the</span><span>  Southern  studs,  for  they  are  maintain</span><span>  ing  their  numbers  in  their  Queensland</span><span>  depots  by  replacing  the  sales  with  fresh</span><span>  drafts.  The  local  studs  are  forced  to</span><span>  cut  their  prices  correspondingly  and</span><span>  cven  so  ate  finding  it  difficult  to  effeet</span><span>  adequate  sales.'  The  real  trouble  is  that</span><span>  the  ram  production  in  Australia  is  now</span><span>  greater  than  the  consumption,  and  thus</span><span>  the  producers  must  suffer  until  a  basis</span><span>  of  readjustment  is  reached.  The  unfor</span><span>  tunate  part  of  it  is  that  the  'Queens-</span><span>  land  studs  are  striving  to  increase  their</span><span>  output  to  establish  their  industry  more</span><span>  soundly  in  this  State  just  at  the  time</span><span>  when  New  South  Wales  is  catering  for</span><span>  local  breeders  on  a  better  buying  basis</span><span>  than  ever,  and  although  progress  is  no</span><span>  ticeable,  it  is  not  so  marked  as  it  would</span><span>  bave  been'  under  better  conditions./</span></p> ",Article,1931-05-21,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

But  the  latter</span><span>  had  its  origin  in  a  quiet  unpretensioo</span><span>  that  symbolised  his  general  demeanour</span><span>  and,  in  a  measure,  masked  the  keen</span><span>  insight  and  depth  of  knowledge  with</span><span>  which  he  approached  the  infinite  variety</span><span>  of  problems  that  the  faithful  discharge</span></p> <p><span>  of  his  onerous  duties  involved.  He</span><span>  eschewed  formal  ostentation,  and  his</span><span>  life  was  an  example  of  that  strength  of</span><span>  character  that  is  humble  by  knowledge</span><span>  and  great  by  sacrifice.

That  they</span><span>  are  among  the  'big  interests'  with</span><span>  which  Labour  demagogues  have  on  in</span><span>  numerable  occasions  tried  to  stampede</span></p> <p><span>  electors  lends  variety  to  the  wiles  of</span><span>  politicians  without  adding  to  the  con</span><span>  sistency  of  their  convictions.  Hence  it</span><span>  is  that  Mr.  Fordo  is  stating  the  case</span><span>  for  iron  workers  instead  of  for  primary</span><span>  producers  when  putting  through  the  in</span><span>  creased  tariffs  on  galvanised  iron,</span><span>  fencing  wire,  and  wire  netting.  Yet  if</span><span>  the  really  'big  interests'  in  Australia</span><span>  are  not  the  primary  producing  inter</span><span>  ests,  it  is  difficult  to  know  what  are.</span><span>  The  difference  of  course  is  that  they</span><span>  are  not  organised  as  are  the  iron  work</span><span>  ers.  Mr.  Forde  showed  where  his  real</span></p> <p><span>  concern  lay  when  last  in  bis  electorate</span><span>  patching  up  the  rift  over  his  nomina</span><span>  tion.  Ho  pleaded  his  case  before  in</span><span>  dustrial  unions,  and  left  the  primary</span><span>  producers  to  be  duped  at  a  later  stage</span><span>  There  were  in  Australia  under  crop</span><span>  in  1920  20,721,000  acres,  and  2,000,000</span><span>  acres  under  permanently-sown  artificial</span><span>  grasses.  Just  what  capital  this  repre</span><span>  sents  it  is  of  course  difficult  to  state,</span><span>  but  on  the  basis  of  which  Governments</span><span>  settled  returned  soldiers  on  the  land,  it</span><span>  would  be  little  short  of  £20  per  acre.</span><span>  This  includes  cost  of  land,  fencing,</span><span>  clearing,  residence,  sheds  and  buildings,</span><span>  implements  and  machinery,  and  pre</span><span>  paring  for  the  first  cultivation,  as  later</span><span>  preparations  would  be  in  the  nature  of</span><span>  crop  working,  and  would  not  be  a</span></p> <p><span>  charge  upon  capital.  This  brings  the</span><span>  capital  investments  of  agriculturalists</span><span>  to  over  £250,000,000,  and  the  cost  of  the</span><span>  2,500,000  dairy  cows  at  £5  per  head</span><span>  carries  it  well  past  the  £260,000,000</span><span>  mark.  This  is  £15,000,000  more  than</span><span>  is  invested  in  factories  in  Australia,</span><span>  and  has  not  touched  the  pastoral  in</span><span>  dustry,  which  has  £10,000,000  invested</span><span>  in  machinery  alone.  Yet  Mr.  Fordo</span><span>  protests  his  platform  concern  for  the</span><span>  unorganised  primary  producer,  and  puts</span><span>  into  effect  his  real  allegiance  to  the</span><span>  well  -organised  trade  unionist.  He  pro</span><span>  tests  for  one,  but  acts  for  the  other.</span><span>  One  shibboleth  in  connection  with  in</span><span>  creased  duties  is  that  manufacturers</span><span>  Lave  undertaken  not  to  raise  prices  be</span><span>  cause  of  the  extra  duties.  .Like  so  many</span><span>  other  shams  and  fallacies,  this  under</span><span>  taking  is  worthless  without'  a  similar</span><span>  undertaking  from  trades  unions  con</span><span>  cerned  that  they  will  not  make  a  grab</span><span>  for  the  added  duty.  The  manufacturer</span><span>  is  then  driven  to  approach  the  Tariff</span><span>  Board  for  more  protection,  and  if  he</span><span>  got  it  and  did  not  apply  it  he  would</span><span>  soon  be  reduced  to  paying  the  increase</span><span>  in  his  wages  bill  from  capital.  The  in</span><span>  creased  tariff,  while  it  enables  him  to</span><span>  undersell  Ids  overseas  competitor,  does</span><span>  not  enable  him  to  pay  more  wages  out</span><span>  of  less  income.  It  does  not  help  the</span><span>  Australian  manufacturer  if  his  com</span><span>  petitor  has  to  pay  more  to  land  his</span><span>  goods  in  Australia,  if  he  himself  has</span><span>  ateo  to  pay  more  to  produce  his  goods.</span><span>  Tin  fallacy  that  high  tariffs  induce</span><span>  employment  also  dies  hard.  Were  this</span><span>  the  case  there  would  not  be  any  unem</span><span>  ployed  at  all  in  Australia  to-day.  Also,</span><span>  were  that  the  wise,  it  would  not  have</span><span>  been  left  to  Australia  to  discover.  Re</span><span>  sults  of  tariffs  depend  upon  more  than</span><span>  the  exuberance  of  an  inexperienced</span><span>  yoiiticiari.  Tariffs,  like  taxation,  de</span><span>  pend  primarily  upon  the  ability  of  the</span><span>  people  to  pay.  That  they  increase  costs</span><span>  is  indisputable.  That  such  increase</span><span>  lulls  heavily  on  the  man  who,  produc</span><span>  ing  to  sell  overseas  .  at  world  parity,</span><span>  lias  also  to  pay  the  6amc  cost  for  all</span><span>  l.is  transport  charges  as  does  the  man</span><span>  who  is  producing  under  heavy  protec</span><span>  tion  for  the  Australian  market,  also</span><span>  is  indisputable.  The  cost  of  all  ser</span><span>  vices  rendered  by  organised  groups  of</span><span>  workers  is  as  heavy  to  the  exporter</span><span>  as  to  the  home  manufacturer,  and,  in</span><span>  the  latest  instance,  costs  for  his  fencing</span><span>  end  building  materials  are  no  less.  than</span><span>  if  tlie  same  material  is  used  in  pro</span><span>  ducing  for  the  Australian  market.</span><span>  Mi-.  Forde  stated,  that  the  amount  of</span><span>  customs  duty  collected  on  a  given  im</span><span>  ported  article  was  not  to  be  taken  iuto</span><span>  account  when  assessing  the  cost  of</span><span>  producing  like  commodities  in  Austra</span><span>  lia.  .  One  reason  he  advanced  for  this</span><span>  umazJng  statement  was  that  such  cus</span></p> <p><span>  toms  eoIlectio^»^'8rA»made  by  the</span><span>  Government  and  sS*^welled  the  public</span><span>  I  revenue.  He  might  as  well  claim  that</span><span>  because  taxation  is  paid  to  Govern</span><span>  ments  to  swell  the  public  revenue,  the</span><span>  proces  does  not  increase  the  cost  of</span><span>  living.  He  also  assumed  that  manu</span><span>  facturers  do  not  impose  the  amount  of</span><span>  tariff  in  their  charges,  but  this  does</span><span>  not  explain  why  it  is  that  they  so  fre</span><span>  quuently  ask  for  more.  The  Tariff</span><span>  Board  is,  in  effect,  a  Wages  Board  and</span><span>  a  Price  Fixing  Board.  The  industry</span><span>  applied  to  ths  Tariff  Board  for  increas</span><span>  ed  protection  in  order  to  meet  overseas</span><span>  competitors,  unions  applied  to  the  Ar</span><span>  bitration  Court  for  increased  wages  be</span><span>  cause  the  newly-protected  industry</span><span>  could  stand  it,  and  the  industry  then</span><span>  passed  on  the  increased  wages  to  the</span><span>  public  and  asked  for  more  tariff  pro</span><span>  tection.</span><span>  Lack  of  any  definite  maximum  tariff</span><span>  —  short  of  an  embargo  —  is  another  die-,</span><span>  concerting  factor.  There  is  no  rule,</span></p> <p><span>  outside  oi  the  muddled  brain  of  a  poli</span><span>  tician,  which  governs  the  application  of</span><span>  increased  duties.  The  relation  of  men</span><span>  who  are  producing  for  world  parity  is</span><span>  compared  with  those  who  are  producing</span><span>  for  sheltered  markets  has  never  been</span><span>  stated  and  defined,  and  until  some  more</span><span>  rational  method  of  gauging  the  effects</span><span>  a  climbing  tariff  is  likely  to  have  upon</span><span>  ar  empty  continent  with  only  a  hand</span><span>  ful  of  consumers  is  established,  tariff</span><span>  matters  will  continue  to  be  the  sport</span><span>  of  politicians,  and  the  lode  star  of  the</span><span>  uninformed.</span></p> ",Article,1931-10-15,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

In  their</span><span>  insatiable  demand  for  money  at  all</span><span>  costs,  in  order  to  cover  up  blunders  and</span><span>  to  embark'  upon  new  foolishness,  gov</span><span>  ernments  forge  the  instruments  for  ex-'</span><span>  tracting  wealth  from  their  subjects  and</span><span>  hand  both  subjects  and  instruments</span></p> <p><span>  over  to  weir  servants,  mat  tne  ser</span><span>  vants  do  their  work  thoroughly  is  no</span><span>  more  than  is  expected  of  them.

The</span><span>  American  representative  also  stated</span><span>  that  although  the  United  States  could</span><span>  not  consent  to  any  definite  export  quota</span><span>  it  would  continue  to  market  the  v  wheat</span></p> <p><span>  under  the  control  of  the  Federal  Farm</span><span>  Board  in  such  a  way  that  prices  would</span><span>  not  be  depressed.</span><span>  Under  these  conditions  a  definite</span><span>  marketing  plan  could  toot  be  considered,</span><span>  but  the  conference  decided  that,  where</span><span>  possible,  a  reduction  in  areas  devoted  to</span><span>  wheat  should  be  undertaken  in  what</span><span>  ever  way  each  country  thought  most</span><span>  effective  and  practical,  and  that  there</span><span>  should  be  a  careful  exploration  of  all</span><span>  avenues  for  the  greater  utilisation  of</span><span>  wheat.  ,  There  is  also  a  lack  of  definite</span><span>  information  regarding  the  movements  of</span><span>  wheat,  the  requirements  of  consuming</span><span>  countries  each  season,  and  the  probable</span><span>  output  from  each  producing  land;  and</span><span>  it  was  decided  to  form  a  clearing  house</span><span>  of  information  to  serve  the  exporting</span><span>  nations  with  details  of  production  and</span><span>  stocks,  crop  prospects  and  areas  sown,</span><span>  marketing  possibilities  and  everything</span><span>  possible  to  assist  in  distributing  surplus</span><span>  supplies.  Tkis  will  be  valuable  to  pro</span><span>  ducing  lands,  although  not  tackling  the</span><span>  problem  of  overproduction  in  any  way.</span><span>  But  it  is  certain  that  economic  consid</span><span>  erations  will  eventually  be  the  means</span><span>  of!  bringing  about  the  desired  result,  for</span><span>  the  farming  community  will  prefer  to</span><span>  turn  towards  other  avenues  of  produc</span><span>  tion  rather  than  continue  unprofitable</span><span>  wheat  {arming.</span><span>  There  has  already  been  a  marked  de</span><span>  crease  in  the  area  sown  in  the  United</span><span>  States  and  other  producing  countries,</span><span>  and  it.  is  anticipated  that  the  forthcom</span><span>  ing  harvest  in  the  Commonwealth  will</span><span>  be  '  much  less  than  it  was  last  season.</span><span>  Many  producers  have  concentrated  on</span><span>  fat  lamb  growing  instead  of  wheat  grow</span><span>  ing,  and  this  tendency  to  seek  profitable</span><span>  spheres  should'  be  encouraged  as  it  will</span><span>  tend  to  relieve  the  wheat  ,  position  and</span><span>  at  the  same  time  place  the*  primary</span><span>  producers  on  a  better  basis.  If  wheat</span><span>  stocks  can  be  reduced  it  will  not;  be</span><span>  long  before  prices  improve^,  to  ;  a'  re</span><span>  munerative  level,  and  this  applies  par</span></p> <p><span>  ticularly  to  the  BritiBh  Dominions</span><span>  which  have  the  prospect.  of  the  introduc</span><span>  tion  of  a  quota  system  after  the  Im</span><span>  perial  Conference  next  year.</span><span>  At  -  the  moment  the  position  is  still</span><span>  tso  uncertain  regarding  stocks  and</span><span>  prices  that  growers  are  accepting  offers,</span><span>  evidently  considering  that  it  is  belter</span><span>  to  sell  at  current  rates  and  secure  the</span><span>  bounty  'than  to  pay  storage  and  risk  the</span><span>  future.  Nothing  has  altered  the  position</span><span>  of  the  accumulated  surplus  abroad,  and</span><span>  although  present  values  are  not  high</span><span>  they  are  generally  more  than  sufficient</span><span>  to  cover  costs  of  production.  It  is</span><span>  anticipated  that  costs  will  be  further</span><span>  reduced  before  next  harvest,  and  if  pre;</span><span>  tent  p'riceB  ere  maintained'  they  will  pro</span><span>  Vide  a  fair  remuneration  to  the  farmer.</span><span>  As  a  matter  of  fact,  reports  from  New</span><span>  South  Wales  indicate  a  definite  move</span><span>  towards  -f*g«|_  WJ£mE7*ySL.  j.t°yrard»</span></p> <p><span>  more  primitive  production  j  millers  are</span><span>  requested-  to  grist  for  the  farmers  them</span><span>  selves,  thereby  preparing  for  home</span><span>  baking  instead  of  relying  on  bakers  and</span><span>  others  ;.  cows  are  being  kept  to  provide</span><span>  milk  and  butter  and  to  dispose  of  the</span><span>  cream  ;  pigs  are  fed  on  the  skimmed</span><span>  milk  ;  poultry  raising  and  vegetable</span><span>  gardens  are  making  vthe  farmers  in</span><span>  dependent  of  the  market  gardens  ;  and</span><span>  so  on,  for  the  growers  hwve  realised  that</span><span>  their  very  existence  has  depended  upon</span><span>  their  economy,  with  the  result  that  they</span><span>  have  become  almost  self-sufficing.

Davies,  M.Sc,  agrostologisfc</span><span>  for  the  Welsh  plant  breeding  station</span><span>  at  Aberystwyth,  has  recently  arrived</span><span>  in  Australia  for  a  special  investigation</span><span>  of  Australian  pasture  problems.  A</span><span>  complete  year's  itinerary  has  been  ar</span><span>  ranged  by  the  Council  of  Scientific  and</span><span>  Industrial  Research  'and  it  is  antici</span><span>  papated  that  his  efforts  will  be  respon</span><span>  kiMb  inr  vnlnnhla,  nHvipo  rptrarttinir  flip.</span></p> <p><span>  country's  grasslands,  and  also  for  the</span><span>  introduction  of  improved  English  and</span><span>  New  Zealand  grasses  which  will  be  of</span><span>  greater  usefulness  than  the  native</span><span>  grasses.  The  need  of  some  such  sur</span><span>  vey  has  been  patent  for  a  long  time,</span><span>  as  it  has  been  obvious  that  Australian</span><span>  pastures  have  not  been  handled  in  the</span><span>  best  methods  in  many  districts,  and</span><span>  this  neglect  has  kept  production  at  a</span><span>  lower  level  than  should  have  been  the</span><span>  case.</span><span>  That  most  of  the  Australian  indigen</span><span>  ous,  pastures  are  to-day  in  a  worse  con</span><span>  dition  than  they  were  about  one  hun</span></p> <p><span>  dred  years  ago  has  already  been  stated</span><span>  by  Mr.  Davies,  and  there  is  no  doubt</span><span>  that  he  is  correct.  For  instance,  it</span><span>  is  only  a.  comparatively  few  years  ago</span><span>  that  the  coastal  pastures  of  Queens</span><span>  land  were  suitable  for  sheep,  yet  to-day</span><span>  they  can  only  carry  cattle  profitably,</span><span>  p.nd  with  the  prevalence  of  spear  grass,</span><span>  it  is  improbable  that  more  than  a  few</span><span>  select  areas  could  be  made  available  for</span><span>  the  fat  lamb  industry  which  is  prov</span><span>  ing  so  profitable  in  the  Southern  States.</span><span>  In  well  nva.aged  districts,  the  reverse</span><span>  should  be  the  case,  as  pastures  should</span><span>  improve  with  proper  grazing  condi</span><span>  tions,  but  there  has  always  been  neglect</span><span>  of  pastures  even  in  the.  Western  por</span><span>  tions  of  Queensland,  which  have  ex</span><span>  ceedingly  valuable  'indigenous  grasses.</span><span>  Most  of  the  trouble  has  been  caused</span><span>  by  what  may  be  termed  extensive  in</span><span>  stead  of  intensive  grazing,  for  the  hold</span><span>  ers  of  large  areas  have  not  been  able</span><span>  to  bestow  upon  their  grass  lands  the</span><span>  care  and  attention  which  is  needed  to</span><span>  maintain  a  gradual  improvement,  and</span><span>  as  a  result  there  has  been  an  almost</span><span>  criminal  waste  of  graBs  in  good  sea</span><span>  sons  with  a  dearth,  of  feed  in  dry</span><span>  periods.  Investigations  have  proved</span><span>  that  over-grazing  is  usually  bad  for</span></p> <p><span>  pastures,  and  better  retu.-ns  have  been</span><span>  obtained  from  rotational  grazing.</span><span>  The  investigation  now  under  way</span><span>  alms  at  ascertaining  the  suitability  of</span><span>  certain  .  plants  for  specified  areas,,  the</span><span>  discovery  of  the  very  best  strains  of  the</span><span>  Bpecics  for  local  conditions,  the  study</span><span>  of  the  fertility  requirements  of  the  vari</span><span>  ous  pasture  types,  the  management*!  the</span><span>  pastures  and  the  effect  upon  them  of  un</span><span>  limited  gracing.  The  proper  manage</span><span>  ment  of  'pastures  will  undoubtedly  lead</span><span>  to  .  an  improvement  in  the  '  carrying</span><span>  capacity  of  Australian  grasslands,  and</span><span>  the  importance  of  the  investigation  is</span><span>  obvious  as  the  Commonwealth  is  essen</span><span>  tially  a  primary  producing  country  de*</span><span>  pendent  chiefly  upon  its  jrazing  indus</span><span>  tries.  It  is  usually  conceded  that  the</span><span>  native  grasses  of  Queensland  are  equal</span></p> <p><span>  to  those  of  any  other  country  through</span><span>  out  the  world,  but  it  is  also  a'  fact</span><span>  that  few  countries  are  so  severely  han</span><span>  dicapped  by  climatic  conditions  and  the</span><span>  problem  of  how  to  take  advantage  of</span><span>  the  bounty  of  nature  is  one  which  has</span><span>  engaged  the  attention  of  many  pro</span><span>  ducers.  .  Success  in  these  directions  has</span><span>  not  vet  been  achieved,  ana  any  inves</span><span>  tigation  such  as  that  now  contem</span><span>  plated  is  welcome,  although  it  is  un</span><span>  likely  that  Mr.  Davies  -  will  be  able</span><span>  to'  more  than  touch  the  fringe,  of  the</span><span>  subject  in  the  brief  time  at  his  dis</span></p> <p><span>  posal.  His  studies  will  be  mainly  con</span><span>  fined  to  the  coastal  belts  of  the  conti</span><span>  nent,  where  it  is  felt  that  the  introduc</span><span>  tion  of  improved  English  and  Neiv  Zea</span><span>  land  grasses  would  do  a  great  deal  to</span><span>  wards  improving  pastures  and  their</span><span>  carrying  capacity.  The  dairying  in</span><span>  dustry  should,  then,  be  the  principal</span><span>  gainer  from  his  visit.  There  are  ex</span><span>  cellent  opportunities  for  this  particu</span><span>  lar  industry,  which  has  been  slow  to</span><span>  take  advanjtage  of  up-to-date  methods</span><span>  such  as  have  proved  successful  in</span><span>  foreign  producing  countries,  but  if  the</span><span>  farmers  can  be  shown  the  value  of  im</span><span>  proving  their  pastures,  and  managing</span></p> <p><span>  tnem  along  scientific  lines,  there  should</span><span>  be  immediate  progress.</span><span>  In  considering  the  matter  of  pasture</span><span>  improvement,  it  is  of  interest  to  quote</span><span>  the  figures  for  Queensland  direct  over</span><span>  seas  exports  for  the  year  1030-31,</span><span>  which  the  Lands  Department  gives  as</span><span>  follows:  —</span><span>  £</span><span>  Wool  ........  ..  ..  6,675,042</span><span>  Meat  ..  ..  ..  ?  ..  2,411,480</span><span>  Other  pastoral  products  638,239</span><span>  Butter,  cheese  and  milk  3,540,200</span><span>  Other  exports  ....  ..  3,491,452</span><span>  Total  ?  £16,756,413</span><span>  So  that  out  of  this  total,  £13,261,961</span></p> <p><span>  represents  the  value  of  the  State's  ex</span><span>  port  trade  from  its  grassland  industries.</span><span>  Any  study  of  pastures  with  the  view  to</span><span>  their  improvement  is  thus  of.  outstand</span><span>  ing1  importance,  and  the  Empire  Mai-</span><span>  keying  Board  ,i»  to  be  commended  for</span><span>  its  co-operation  in  making  the  present</span><span>  investigation  possible.</span></p> ",Article,1931-11-19,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

The</span><span>  fact  is  that  when  constituted  in  1895,</span><span>  the  Board  inherited  from  the  then</span><span>  Government-  a  developmental  policy  on</span><span>  which  considerable  progress  had  been</span><span>  made.  Some  of  the  progress  was  of  a</span><span>  negligible  character,  instances  of  which</span><span>  were  the  Port  Alma  wharf,  which  was</span><span>  not  connected  with  the  land  ;  Bcoad</span><span>  mount  wharf,  which  was  not  connected</span><span>  with  low  water  ;  and  the  training  wall</span><span>  at  the  Upper  Flats,  which  was  on  the</span><span>  wrong  side  of  the  river.  The  outlay  on</span><span>  these  and  other  Rockhampton  port</span><span>  works  when  the  Harbour  Board  was</span><span>  formed  amounted  to  £312,952,  and  is</span><span>  only  £13  5s.  per  cent,  of  the  total</span><span>  amount  (£2,316,045)  spent  by  different</span><span>  Governments  on  all  the  ports  of  Queens</span><span>  land  up  to  31st  of  June  last.  This  does</span><span>  not  suggest  that  the  Central  District</span><span>  received,  on  a  population  basis,  any  more</span><span>  than  its  share  of  what  it  was  the  policy</span><span>  of  those  Governments  to  spend.  That  is</span><span>  to  say,  'the  people  of  Central</span><span>  Queensland  .in  paying  their  share</span><span>  of  £llij645,-  which  was  the  in</span><span>  terest  paid  last  year  on  the  total</span><span>  £2,316,045,  are  actually  paying  interest</span><span>  on  money  spent  *by-3overnments  in  their</span><span>  early  efforts  tc  develop  the  port  of</span><span>  Rockhampton.</span><span>  That  £312,952  represented,  however,</span><span>  something  more  tangible  even  than  the</span><span>  three  blunders  mentioned.  It  represent</span><span>  ed  an  earnest  of  definite  Government</span><span>  policy  of  port  development  that  an</span><span>  allocation  of  territory,  or  taxing  area,</span><span>  under  the.  Rockhampton  Harbour  Board</span><span>  Act,  confirmed.  The  Harbour  Board</span><span>  accepted  both  the  policy  and  taxing</span><span>  area  as  components  one  of  the  other.</span><span>  No  sane  body  of  men  would  have</span><span>  accepted  the  policy  without  the  taxing</span><span>  area  from  which  to  draw  revenue,,  and</span><span>  none  anticipated  that  any  subsequent</span><span>  Government  would  invade  that  area</span><span>  without  also  accepting  responsibility</span><span>  for  commitments  under  the  policy.</span><span>  But  Government  supervision  did  not</span><span>  end  when  the  Board  took  control.  Every</span><span>  item  of  capital  expenditure  was  sub</span><span>  jected  to  Governmental  scrutiny  and,</span><span>  where  the  amount  was  large,  it  was  not</span><span>  advanced  until  a  Government  expert  had</span><span>  vouched  for  the  soundness,  of  the  scheme.</span><span>  Rockhampton  Harbour  Board  policy</span><span>  therefore  is  the  continuation  of  early</span><span>  Government  policy,  that  was  varied  only</span><span>  on  the  advice  of  Government  experts.  If</span><span>  that  policy  has  proved  beneficial,  then</span><span>  the-  Government  experts  are  to  be  com</span><span>  plimented.  Conversely,  if  that  policy</span><span>  has  not  met  early  expectations,  or  has</span><span>  not  provided  in  full  all  that  was.  hoped</span><span>  of  it,  ,the  Harbour  Board  is  hot  to  be</span><span>  condemned.</span><span>  This,  however,  is  but  one  aspect  of</span><span>  luo  case.  Invasion  by  Government  rail</span><span>  ways  of  the  territory  allocated  to  the</span><span>  Harbour  Board  has  proved  more  dis</span><span>  astrous  to  Harbour  Board  operations</span><span>  than  any  other  .factor*  That  invasion</span><span>  was  the  outcome  of  a  Government  rail</span><span>  way  policy  which,.  lost  year,  resulted  in</span><span>  77  per  cent,  of  the  total  trade  of  the</span><span>  State  passing.  through  Brisbane.  It  was</span><span>  a  direct  negation  o!  the  earlier  policy</span><span>  of  developing  provincial  ports,  and  the</span><span>  consequences  i-i  its  adoption  ,  and  opera</span><span>  tion  could  have  been'  foreseen  by  any</span><span>  novice  of  transport  economics.  In  m</span><span>  ?parsely  populated  State,  where  ports</span><span>  fcad'  performed  all  the  functions  of</span><span>  development  so  far  as  those  functions</span><span>  apply  to  the  coastwise  carriage  of  goods,</span><span>  ?  ?  ?  ?  .</span></p> <p><span>  a  coast  railway  was  sheer  extravagencc.</span><span>  That  it  has  since  been  used  to  filch</span><span>  trade  from  the  ports  is  evidence  of  the</span><span>  pull  of  the  metropolis,  and  can  end</span><span>  ultimately  only  in  closing  ports  that  the</span><span>  Government  hap  been  at  such  pains  to</span><span>  develop  or  have  developed.  That</span><span>  £28,000,000  has  been  'written  off'  rail</span><span>  way  capitalisation,  and  that  about  three</span><span>  fourths  of  that  sum  has  been  wrung</span></p> <p><span>  from  taxpayers  to  meet  interest  com</span><span>  mitments,  does  not  suggest  that  with</span><span>  the  ports  closed  the  aggregate  cost  of</span><span>  transport  to  the  nation  is  erer  to  be</span><span>  come  cheaper.</span><span>  This  was  the  condition  of  affairs  when</span><span>  the  State  Treasurer  visited  Rockhamp</span><span>  ton  to  discuss  with  the  Harbour  Board</span><span>  finance,  but  not  trade.  He  was  follow</span><span>  ed  after  a  short  interval  -by  the  Minister</span><span>  for  Railways  to  discuss  trade,  and  not</span><span>  finance.  The  Treasurer  wanted  his</span><span>  pound  of  flesh,  that  was  withheld  only</span><span>  because  State  railways  were  filching</span><span>  trade  from  the  Harbour  Board  ;  and</span><span>  the  Minister  for  Railways  wanted  trade,</span><span>  without  any  reference  to  how  taking</span><span>  such  trade  left  the  Harbour  Board</span><span>  relatively  to  its  commitments  to  the</span><span>  Treasurer.  It  seems  difficult  to  reconcile</span><span>  the  two  statements  as  coming  from  two</span><span>  responsible  Ministers  in  the  same</span><span>  Cabinet.  The  Board  is  being  pressed</span><span>  to  pay  its  interest  and  redemption  com</span><span>  mitments  despite  the  loss  of  trade  to</span><span>  the  State  railways,  and  the  railways  are</span><span>  relieved  of  £28,000,000  of  capitalisation</span><span>  in  order  that  they  may,  with  the  aid</span><span>  of  such  trade  as  can  be  taken  from  de</span><span>  veloped  ports  by  preferential  rates,</span><span>  make  a  show  of  paying  interest  and  no</span><span>  redemption.</span></p> <p><span>  These  facts  in  themselves  are  sufficient</span><span>  to  arouse  resentment,  and  to  involve</span><span>  Government  candidates  in  unnecessary</span><span>  burdens  when  next  they  -face  the  electors.</span><span>  But  the  contradictions  of  Mr.  Barnes  are</span><span>  not  likely  to  assist  them,  and  unless</span><span>  an  authoritative  statement  is  forthcom</span><span>  ing  very  shortly,  the  inconsistencies  of</span><span>  the  Treasurer  will  come  to  be  regarded</span><span>  as  indicative  of  Government  policy  and</span><span>  Government  attitude  toward  this  part</span><span>  of  the  State.</span><span>  Mr.  Barnes  stated  that  since  1918  the</span><span>  Rockhampton  Harbour  Board  had  paid</span><span>  only  £1000,  and  subsequently  admitted</span><span>  that  the  board  had  paid.  £103,841.  He</span><span>  said  that  expenditure  on  the  port  of</span><span>  Brisbane  since  1893  was  met  either  from</span><span>  port  revenue  or  else  by  loans  from  the</span><span>  Treasury  'the  same  way  as  loans  to</span><span>  harbour  boards,'  where  the  Auditor</span><span>  General  said  it  was  met  from  the  Har</span><span>  bour  Dues  Trust  Fund.  The  Treasurer  j</span><span>  said  that  the  Brisbane  Harbour  Account  j</span><span>  was  not  in  arrear  at  the  end  of  June(</span><span>  last  by  £105,429,  but  admitted  that  the^</span><span>  Harbour  Dues  Trust  Fund  was.  The</span><span>  Auditor-Gfeneral  shows  both  the  Bris</span><span>  bane  Harbour  Account  and  the  Harbour,</span><span>  Dues  Account  are,  in  debit  by  £105,429,</span><span>  but  seeing  that  the  latter  is  the  collec-.</span><span>  tion  account  and  the  former  the  work</span><span>  ing  account,  we  leave  it  to  Mr.  Barnes</span><span>  to  explain  the  difference.</span><span>  Understating  Rockhampton's  pay</span><span>  ments  and  Brisbane's  indebtedness  is</span><span>  not  the  happiest  method  by  which  to</span><span>  establish  confidence,  in  Central  Queens</span><span>  land,  of  Government  -bona-fides.'  Neither</span><span>  is  taking  our  trade  and  also  demanding</span><span>  payment  of  commitments  built  up  in</span><span>  anticipation  ol  that  trade  going  to  be</span><span>  helpful.  Nobody  has  yet  suggested</span><span>  seriously  that  the  Government  do  for</span><span>  the  ports  what  it  has  done  for  the  rail</span><span>  ways,  but  persistence  in  the  present</span><span>  policy  will  result  eventually  in  the  rail</span><span>  ways  having  the.  trade,  and  the  Govern</span><span>  ment  the  port  debt.</span></p> ",Article,1931-11-26,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

As  a  matter  of  fact,</span></p> <p><span>  so  iar  as  aaunerauon  is  concerned,  mere</span><span>  is  this  to  be  said  —  with  the  exception</span><span>  of  eight  samples  of  preserved  fruit</span><span>  (which  contained  a  larger  proportion  of</span><span>  preservative  than  the  law  allowed)</span><span>  and  eleven  samples  of  minced  meat</span><span>  (which  contained  the  same  preservative,</span><span>  but  which  the  law  laid  down  should  not</span><span>  bt  used),  nothing  deleterious  to  health</span><span>  was  found.  The  most  that  could  be</span><span>  charged  against  anyone  was  that  the</span><span>  article  that  was  offered  to  the  public</span><span>  was  not  of  the  strength  or  of  the  stan</span><span>  -  dard  laid  down.  For  instance,  milk  was</span><span>  watered,  in  one  case,  and  that  a  Rock</span><span>  hampton  one,  to  the  extent  of  over  eigh</span><span>  teen  per  cent.  So  also  was  whiskey,</span><span>  in  a.  Rockhampton  case  by  as  much  as  a</span><span>  little  over  ten  per  cent.  And  again,</span><span>  eighteen  samples  out  of  thirty  of  orunge</span><span>  beverages  were  found  to  contain  le\s</span><span>  than  three  per  cent,  of  the  pure  juice</span><span>  of  the  orange  instead  of  the  five  per</span><span>  cont  of  it  that  the  law  allotted.</span><span>  It  is  not  only  on  the  food  of  mw'</span><span>  that  the  eye  of  our  public  officials  is</span><span>  kept.  Food  for  stock  is  also  subjected  to</span><span>  Krutlny.  And  there  is  need  of  it.  Some</span><span>  samples  of  feed  wheat  that  were  offered</span><span>  for  sale,  and  about  which  complaint</span><span>  Lad  been  made,  were  found  to  be  mouldy</span><span>  and  insect-infested  and,  therefore!  quite</span><span>  unfit  for  food  for  poultry.  Wheatmeal</span><span>  also  that  was  useless  for  poultry  was</span><span>  discovered  ;  in  fact,  the  loss  of  birds</span><span>  in  many  cases  was  traced  to  its  me  of</span><span>  it.  The  authorities  cannot  be  expected,</span><span>  of  course,  to  trace  all  the  tradepeople</span><span>  who  are  in  the  habit  of  offering  foods</span><span>  that  do  not  come  up  to  the  standard</span><span>  of  purity  which  they  have  established,</span><span>  but  users  of  the  foods  can  help  them</span><span>  selves  in  the  matter.  They  can,  by  re</span><span>  ferring  to  the  lists  that  are  contained</span><span>  in  the  annual  reports  of  the  Depart</span><span>  ment  of  Agriculture  and  tSock,  ascer</span><span>  tain  the  names  of  the  firms  who  make</span><span>  it  a  practice  of  sending  the  goods  that</span><span>  they  are  offering  for  sale  every  year  to</span><span>  the  Department  for  analysis  and  the</span><span>  results  of  the  analysis  of  these,  and  in</span><span>  that  way.  to  some  extent,  protect  them</span><span>  selves.  They  can  also,  as  the  depart</span><span>  ment  advises  them,  call  on  the  firms</span><span>  that  they  propose  to  do  business  with</span><span>  and  see  for  themselves  what  it  is  that</span><span>  they  are  ftffering  for  sale,  and,  above</span><span>  all,  that  they  are  putting  up  sound  raw</span><span>  materials.  Again  they  are  recommen</span><span>  ded  by  the  department  to  buy  products</span><span>  of  Queensland  flour  mills—  as,  for  ex</span><span>  ample,  bran  and  pollard  —  rather  than</span><span>  .those  of  the  mills  of  the  southern</span><span>  States,  the  .Queensland  articles  being</span><span>  usually  better  and  of  higher  feeding</span><span>  value.</span><span>  The  official  oversight  that  is  given  to</span><span>  animal  foods  is  also  extended  to  the</span><span>  fertilisers  that  are  used  by  the  farmers</span><span>  in  producing  those  goods.  Farmers,</span><span>  however,  are  urged  to  help  themselves</span><span>  in  the  matter.  They  would  be  well  ad</span><span>  niaed,  it  is  said,  never  to  accept  the</span><span>  delivery  of  any  material  unless  it  has</span><span>  affixed  to  every  package  .a  plainly  prin</span><span>  ted  label  setting  out  the  percentages</span><span>  of  the  essential.  ingredients  and  of  the</span><span>  forms  in  which  they  occur.  They  should,</span><span>  also,  It  is  added,  demand  an  invoice</span><span>  certificate  setting  out  the  same  parti</span><span>  culars,  that  being  the  tonly  guarantee</span><span>  that  they  can  get.  They  are  recommen</span><span>  ded  to  go  eo  far  even  as  to  refuse  to</span><span>  take  the  material  unless  it  bears  the</span><span>  label  and  is  accompanied  by  the  certi</span><span>  ficate.  That  the  farmers  would  be  wise</span><span>  to  pay  heed  to  the  advice  thus  given</span><span>  is  illustrated  by  the  fact  that  in  the</span><span>  early  part  of  last  year  complaints  were</span><span>  made  to  the  department  as  to  the  qual</span><span>  ity  of  alleged  fertilisers  supposed  to</span><span>  contain  secret  ingredients.  The  buyers,</span><span>  unfortunately,  were  reluctant  to  give</span><span>  such  information  as  would  have  enabled</span><span>  prompt  action  to  be  taken.  The  de</span><span>  partment  nevertheless  started  investiga</span><span>  tion!  in  Brisbane  and  finally  traced  the</span><span>  fertilisers  to  their  sources  —  two  to  lead</span><span>  ing  ,  towns  in  Southern  Queensland,  a,</span><span>  third  to  a  big  town  in  the  South.  The</span><span>  fertiliser  of  one  of  the  Southern  towns</span></p> <p><span>  consisted  of  ..horse  manure,  sawdust,</span><span>  and'  vegetable  matter  ;  the  fertiliser  of</span><span>  the  other  Southern  town  of  town  refuse</span><span>  and  sewerage  sludge  ;  and  that  of  the</span><span>  Northern  town  of  the  contents  of  filter</span><span>  presser,  incincerator  ash,  and  a  trace  of</span><span>  burnt  bone.  Nitrogen,  phosphoric  acid,</span><span>  and  potash—  the  essentials  of  a  fertili</span><span>  ser  —  were,  of  course,  formed  in  each,  but</span><span>  in  such  Infinitesimal  proportions  that</span><span>  the  material  was  worth  only  18s.  6d.,</span><span>  Us.  10d..  12s.  7d.,  and  16s.  lOd.  per</span><span>  ton,  but  the  prices  that  the  purchasers</span><span>  gave  for  them  were  £12,  £4  10s.,  £2  2s.,</span><span>  and  £12  per  ton.  And  besides  these</span><span>  four  '  fertilisers  '  the  department</span><span>  traced  two  otffers  to  a  third  Southern</span><span>  town  —  one  of  which  was  composed  of</span><span>  town  refuse,  the  other  of  sheep  manure</span><span>  —one  worth  9s.  6d.  per  ton  as  a  fertili</span><span>  ser  and  the  other  14s.—  but  for  which</span><span>  the  buyers  of  gave  £4  10s.  and  £2  10s.</span><span>  per  ton-  As  we  have  already  remarked</span><span>  in  regard  to  stock  foods,  it  is  impossible</span><span>  for  the  department  to  protect  all  and</span><span>  sundry  of  our  cultivators  from  the  rapa</span><span>  city  of  some  of  these  who  offer  them</span><span>  fertilisers,  but  if,  in  addition  to  doing</span><span>  what  the  department  has  so  strongly</span><span>  recommended  them  to  do,  they  also</span><span>  study  the  list  of  vendors  who  have</span><span>  submitted  their  wares  for  analysis  by</span><span>  the  department  and  officials,  with  the</span><span>  results  of  the  analysis  of  them  —  as  set</span><span>  out  in  the  yearly  report  of  the  depart</span><span>  ment  —  they  will  know  where  to  buy  and</span><span>  what  to  buy.</span><span>  Attention  is,  of  course,  given  by  the</span><span>  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Stock  to</span><span>  another  matter  that  is  of  paramount</span><span>  importance-  to  farmers,  namely,  their</span><span>  seed  supply.  For  their  protection  it</span><span>  has  set  up,  as  in  the  cases  of  stock</span><span>  foods  and  fertilisers,  a  standard  —  not</span><span>  of  actual  purity,  but  as  near  to  that</span><span>  as  it  is  possible  to  get.  And  so  that</span><span>  they  shall  have  no  excuse  for  saying</span><span>  that  that  is  of  no  use  to  them,  they  are</span><span>  given  the  privilege  of  sending  the  sam</span><span>  ples  of  the  seed  that  they  buy  to  bo</span><span>  analysed  free  of  cost  to  themselves.  Ap</span><span>  parently,  though,  they  place  little  value</span><span>  on  (that  privilege,  for  only  thirty  -nina  |</span><span>  of  the  tens  of  thousands  of  them  that  '</span><span>  we  have,  thought  it  worth  their  while  I</span><span>  to  take  advantage  of  it  last  year.  Ven</span><span>  dors  seemingly  were  more  anxious  about</span><span>  their  welfare  than  they  themselves,  the</span><span>  number  of  samples  sent  in  by  them  to</span><span>  be  tested  before  being  offered  for  sale</span><span>  being  281,  while  as  many  as  759  sam</span><span>  ples  were  taken  by  officers  of  the  de</span><span>  partment  to  see  that  they  conplied  with</span><span>  requirements.  Of  the  281  samples  sent</span><span>  in,  over  fifty  per  cent,  came  from  mer</span><span>  chants  in  Brisbane  and  Toowoomba</span><span>  who  have  laid  down  machinery  for</span><span>  cleaning  the  seed,  twenty-five  per  cent,</span><span>  came  from  seedsmen  and  storekeepers,</span><span>  and  the  balance  from  farmers  who  bad  .</span><span>  seed  of  their  own  raising  that  thev  ?</span><span>  wished  to  sell.  That  there*  is  need  for</span><span>  our  farmers  to  look  after  their  own  in-  !</span><span>  terests  in  the  matter  goes  without  say</span><span>  ing,  but  it  may  be  pointed  out  that  the  .</span><span>  department  has  felt  it  necessary,  in  ,</span><span>  consequence  of  the  presence  of  the  seed</span><span>  of  fodder  in  so  many  samples  of  lu</span><span>  cerne  seed  that  it  has  tested,  to  advise</span><span>  our  farmers  to  obtain  their  supply  of</span><span>  seed  only  from  merchants  known  to  pos</span><span>  sess'  efficient  .  seed-cleaning  machinery.</span><span>  It  does  not  show  who  those  merchants  ,</span><span>  are  as  in  the  cases  of  animal  foods  J</span><span>  and  fertilisers,  but  there  is  possibly  |</span><span>  a  good  reason  for  that.  Of  the  danger</span><span>  that  farmers  run  from  purchasing  un-  -</span><span>  cleaned  seed,  however,  it  gives  the  fol-  ,</span><span>  lowing  notable  illustration  :  —  '  A  few</span><span>  weeks  since  a  large  Toowoomba  mer</span><span>  chant  sent  to  the  department  a  sample  i</span><span>  ?of  the  cleanings  —  that  is,  ?  the  foreign  j</span><span>  matter  that  it  was  cleaning  out  —  that</span><span>  it  was  getting  from  a  consignment  of</span><span>  southern  grown  Algerian  oats,  and</span><span>  which,  it  was  stated,  represented  an</span><span>  average  of  7  Ib.  weight  of  weed  seed'</span></p> <p><span>  to  each  bag.  -Assuming  that  the  bulk1</span><span>  of  the  consignment  contains  five  per</span><span>  cent,  by  weight  of  these  weed  seeds,  it</span><span>  would  mean  with  an  average  sample</span><span>  of  the  oats,  that  in.  each  pound  a  far</span><span>  mer  would  sow  about  14.730  oat  seed</span><span>  and  31,985  weed  seed.  And  in  this</span><span>  connection,  the  department  remarks</span><span>  that  it  would  appear  that  the  average</span><span>  buyer  seldom  asks  for  seed  oats,  being</span><span>  content  to  purchase  the  cheapest  pos</span><span>  sible,  oats  probably  not  even  fit  for</span><span>  feeding  purposes.  In  the  face  of  such</span><span>  a  statement  as  this,  it  is  hardly  to  be</span><span>  considered  at  that  we  hear  of  low  ger</span><span>  rninfttors  of  many  crops  —  as,  for  exam</span><span>  ple,,  twenty-four  seedlings  of  Paspalum</span><span>  Dilatum  from  800  seeds,  or  only  three</span><span>  per  cent,  and  one  per  cent,  in  the  case</span><span>  of  a  sample  of  pumpkin  seed  —  not  to</span><span>  speak  of  samples  of  other  seed  that  did</span><span>  not  yield  a  single  plant.  The  depart</span><span>  ment  might  have  been  forgiven,  in  the</span><span>  face  of  the  facts  that  we  have  cited,  if</span><span>  it  had  offered  no  further  advice  to  our</span><span>  farmers  in  regard  to  their  seed  supply,</span><span>  but,  to  its  credit  be  it  said,  it  recom</span><span>  mends  them  to  tak«  the  precaution  to</span><span>  inform  these  suppliers  of  their  intention</span><span>  to  submit  samples  of  their  seed  to  the</span><span>  department  and  to  insist  on  an  invoice</span><span>  as  in  the  case  of  efrtilisers.  As  an  ex</span><span>  ample  of  the  farmers'  seeming  disregard</span><span>  of  their  own  welfare  in  this  particular</span><span>  it  may  be  remarked  that,  of  the  many</span><span>  hundreds  that  we  have  in  Central</span><span>  Queensland,  only  one  last  year  thought</span><span>  it-worth  his  while  to  apply  for  an  analy</span><span>  sis  of  the  seed  that  he  had  purchased,</span><span>  and.  like  so  many  others  in  other  parts</span><span>  of  Queensland,  did  not  ask  for  that  un</span><span>  til  after  his  first  planting  of  the  seed</span><span>  had  failed  instead  of  before  he  planted</span><span>  any  of  it.</span></p> ",Article,1931-03-12,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

It  may  be  that  it  has</span></p> <p><span>  again  turned  the  same  corner,  in  which</span><span>  case  the  wisdom  of  duplicating  the</span><span>  turnings  round  one  corner,  or  the  cor</span><span>  ners  round  which  to  turn,  is  dubious.</span><span>  But  when  on  electioneering  bent  ah  odd</span><span>  corner  or  turning  is  immaterial.

The</span><span>  fact  is  that  our  creditors  would  trust</span><span>  us  no  further,  and  the  banks  sat  tight</span><span>  on.  all  available  credits.

To</span><span>  a  man  —  or  a  nation—  with  neither</span><span>  money  nor  credit  the  fiscal  policy  of  a</span><span>  nation  counts  for  little.  He  is  as  un</span><span>  able  to  bay  under  either  free  trade  or</span><span>  high  protection  and  ceases  to  be  an  im</span><span>  porter  until  his  own  finances  improve—</span><span>  or  his  creditors  can  be  brought  to  be</span><span>  lieve  they  have  improved.</span><span>  On  top  of  our  own  inability  to  ob</span><span>  tain  further  credit—  and  largely  because</span><span>  of  it—  the  30  per  cent  exchange  rate  has</span><span>  operated  as  a  steadying  agent  Nobody</span><span>  but  a  politician  would  regard  a  30  per</span><span>  cent  adverse  exchange  rate  .as  indica</span><span>  tive  of  -healthy  finance.  It  is  equal  to</span><span>  30  per  cent  increase  in  the  prices  of  all</span><span>  imports,  or  as  a  fiat  rate  tariff  of  that</span><span>  amount  on  the  whole  of  them.  It  really</span><span>  was  a  hint,  on  top  of  shutting  off  credit,</span><span>  that  our  creditors  would  rather  we  paid</span><span>  a,  little  off  earlier  commitments  than</span><span>  that  :  we  go  on  contracting  new  ones.</span><span>  When  Mr.  Forde  extols  the  present  trade</span><span>  position,  he  really  extols  the  work  of</span><span>  the  banks,  yet  he  would  be  astonished</span><span>  at  .his  enthusiasm  for  institutions  he</span><span>  has  so  recently  and  thoroughly  de</span><span>  nounced.</span><span>  Mr.  Forde  leaves  it  to  be  assumed</span><span>  that  the  goods  we  no  longer  import  are</span><span>  being  manufactured  within  Australia.</span><span>  The  cold  fact  is  that  Australia  is  do</span><span>  ing  without  them,  and  is  not  buying  a</span><span>  vast  amount  of  commodities  produced  on</span><span>  the  premises.  The  exuberant  Minis</span><span>  ter  states  that  the  Scullin  Government's</span><span>  'fiscal  policy  has  given  a  great  fillip</span><span>  to  manufacturing.'  This  being  the</span><span>  ?use,  the  miracle,  is  being  performed</span><span>  with  one-third  of  Australia's  man</span><span>  power  out  of  work,  as  large  a  propor</span><span>  tion  of  her  woman  and  child  power  be</span><span>  low  the  bread  line,  and  30,000,000  less</span><span>  output  last  year  from  her  factories.  No</span><span>  sane1  vei.-on  believes  such  arrant  non</span><span>  sous«,  itud  it  would  be.  a  reproach  on  the</span><span>  native  ;rgacity  of  Mr.  Foide  to  accuse</span><span>  him  cf  bc':eving  it  either.  For  the</span><span>  same  reason,  it  is  a  gratuitous  affront</span><span>  to  the  intelligence  of  the  populace  to</span><span>  ejepect  them  to  discredit  the  evidence</span><span>  cf  their  own  senses.</span><span>  Mr.  ForJc  announces  that  Britain</span><span>  has  decided  to  adopt  a  tariff  poluy.</span><span>  What  Britain  really  did  was  throw  out</span><span>  men  who  wanted  to  tinker  with  her</span><span>  finance,'  men  who,  endeavouring  to  bene</span><span>  ?t  their,  shoddy  party  at  her  expense,</span><span>  .  refused  their  support  to  the  Mac</span><span>  D-wald'4»aldwMi  coalition.  When  a</span></p> <p><span>  crisis  looms  in  Britain  the  claims  of  the</span><span>  nation  rise  superior  to  those  of  party,</span><span>  and  the  people  turn  naturally  and</span><span>  promptly  .  to  an  amalgamation  of  the</span><span>  best  brains  from  all  parties.  British</span><span>  history  is  rich  in  instances  where  party</span><span>  went  ovefboard  when  the  ship  of  state</span><span>  began  to  labour.  Mr.  Scullin  states</span><span>  that  he  docs  not  believe  in  coalition</span><span>  governments,  and  he  says  it  at  a  time</span><span>  when  he  holds  office  at  the  will  and</span><span>  pleasure  of  five  of  his  bitterest  politi</span><span>  cal  enemies.  The  Scullin  Government</span><span>  is  best  known  for  the  readiness  with</span><span>  which  the  principle  of  yesterday  is  jet</span><span>  tisoned  to-day,  for  the  confidence  it  has</span><span>  withered,  and  the  number  of  times  it</span><span>  was  prevented,  by  the  Senate,  from</span><span>  plunging  the  nation  into  one  madness  or</span><span>  another.  i</span><span>  The  hopes  of  the  Fordes  and  the</span><span>  Sculling  are  now  centred  on  the  pros</span><span>  pects  of  Britain  imposing  additional</span><span>  taxation  on  her  suffering  millions,  so</span><span>  that  an  Australian  standard  of  living</span><span>  may  be  maintained.  The  British  al</span><span>  ready  are  the  highest-taxed  people  on</span><span>  earth,  yet  it  is  the  hope  of  Mr.  Forde</span><span>  that  their  burden  will  be  increased  to</span><span>  make  a  picnic  for  Australian  politicians.</span><span>  At  the  same  time,  Australia  is  free</span><span>  trade  with  respect  to  her  exports.  That</span><span>  is  to  say,  she  sells  her  produce  in  the</span><span>  dearest  market,  without  respect  as  to</span><span>  where  that  market  is.  (</span><span>  Mr..  Forde  hopes  for  preference  on</span><span>  raw  materials,  which  amounts  to  hop</span><span>  ing  thai  Britain  will  impose  on  herself</span><span>  an  additional  handicap  when  it  comes</span><span>  to  selling  the  goods  manufactured  from</span><span>  those  raw  materials.  Could  Britain</span><span>  dispose,  of  the-  whole'  of  her  factory</span><span>  output  to  her  Dominions,  and  live  on</span><span>  the  proceeds  the  handicap  might  disap</span><span>  pear  in  inter-Dominion,  transactions.</span><span>  But  she  has.  to  face  world  competition</span><span>  for  her  manufactured  goods,  which  is  a</span><span>  vastly  different  proposition  to  facing  it</span><span>  only  in  respect  to  raw  products.  Aus-  :</span><span>  tralia  cannot  manufacture  goods  for  her</span><span>  own  needs  even  with  13,000  miles  oti</span><span>  natural  protection,  a  30  per  cent  ad</span><span>  verse  exehange,  and  Mr.  Forde's  tariff</span><span>  wall.  Yet  he  hopes  that  Britain  will</span><span>  tax  the.  raw  materials  from  which  she</span><span>  will  turn  out  goods  to  be  sold  on  world</span><span>  parity.</span><span>  Mr.  Forde  hopes  also  that  Britain</span><span>  will  tax  her  imported  foodstuffs,  and</span><span>  by  so  doing  pay  something  toward  the</span><span>  artificial  standard  of  living  in  Aus</span><span>  tralia.  There  are  in  Britain  many</span><span>  millions  of  people  who  never  rise  much</span><span>  above,  the  bread  line,  yet  Mr.  Forde</span><span>  would  hare  them  taxed.  There  prob</span><span>  ably  will  emerge/  a  strengthening  of  Im</span><span>  perial  ties  through  *'?-»  policy  of  a</span><span>  British  Government  of  the  calibre  of  the</span><span>  MacDonald-Baldwin  combination,  but  it</span><span>  is  peculiar-  that  the  Scullins  and  Fordes,</span></p> <p><span>  who  hare  denounced  Imperialism  and  all]</span><span>  its  works,  should  hope  to  benefit  from'</span><span>  such  a  development.  I</span><span>  Just  how  those  strengthened  ties  willi</span><span>  affect  Australia  remains  to  be  seen.</span><span>  That  we  will  enjoy  any  benefits  from</span><span>  the  process  is  but  natural,  just  as  it  is</span><span>  that  we  also  should  make  sacrifices  in</span><span>  the  common  interest.  But  it  is  strange</span><span>  that  Mr.  Fordo,  whose  knowledge  of</span><span>  Australian  economics  and  finance  is  die-)</span><span>  tated  by  the  latest  edict  from  the'</span><span>  Trades  Hall,  should  Vissay  to  interpret</span><span>  the  policy  of  a  British  coalition  govern-'</span><span>  ment  that  was  elected  only  a  week  ago</span><span>  out  of  the  wreckage  of  the  British</span><span>  Labour  Party.</span></p> ",Article,1931-11-12,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

Whether  all  killing  of  live  stock</span><span>  and  the  retailing  of  meat  through</span><span>  out  tho  State  should  operate  under</span><span>  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Metropoli</span><span>  tan  Meat  Industry  Board.</span><span>  t.  How  much  benefit  would  result  to</span><span>  the  producers  by  the  adoption  of</span><span>  standard  grade  governing  all  meat</span><span>  sent  abroad.</span><span>  3.  Whether  country  killing  would</span><span>  improve  the  quality  and  thus  bene</span><span>  fit  the  export  market,  as  well  as</span><span>  local  producers  and  consumers.</span><span>  4.  Whether  the  existing  works  oper</span><span>  ate  in  the  best  Interests  of  the</span><span>  trade.  J</span></p> <p><span>  These  questions  apparently  give  the</span><span>  Board  scope  for  introducing  f  undamen-  j</span><span>  tal  reforms  if  they  are  considered  bene</span><span>  ficial  to  the  industry,  and  it  is  prob</span><span>  able  that  Queensland  will  gain  some-  ,</span><span>  thing  through  watching  the  experiences  .</span><span>  of  New  South  Wales  in  this  regard,  I</span><span>  although  this  State  has  in  the  past,  of</span><span>  its  own  accord,  .  experimented  further</span><span>  with  public  control  than  any  other</span><span>  State  of  the  Commonwealth.  The  re</span><span>  ?ults  of  the  incursions  into  the  retail</span><span>  meat  trade  were  so  disastrous  that  the</span><span>  industry  is  to  be  allowed  to  develop  un</span><span>  dw  the  control  of  private  enterprise'</span><span>  in  future,  and  it  is  probable  that  New</span><span>  South  Wales  will  enjoy  a  somewhat</span><span>  similar  .experience.  At  the  moment  the</span><span>  Meat  Board  blames  the  carcase  butchers</span><span>  and  tht  middlemen  generally1  for  keep</span><span>  ing  the  returns  to  producers  so  low,</span><span>  stating  that  the  industry  is  in  the</span><span>  hands  of  a  group  of  buyers  who  domin</span><span>  ate  the  position  and  control  the  market</span><span>  from  the  beasts  on  the  hooves  to  the</span><span>  distribution  of  the  carcase.  But  the</span><span>  control  of  tho  killing  of  all  live  stock</span><span>  in  New  South  Wales  and  the  retailing</span><span>  of  meat  throughout  the  State  would</span><span>  necessitate  large  capital  expenditures</span><span>  and  a  total  reorganisation  of  distribu</span><span>  tive  facilities,  which,  judged  in  tho  light</span><span>  of  past  experience,  would  perhaps  cul</span><span>  minate  in  heavy  losses.</span><span>  Of  the  questions  being,  considered  by</span><span>  the  Board,  the  adoption  of  a  standard</span><span>  grading  of  exportable)  meat  would  have</span><span>  the  greatest  benefit  throughout  the</span><span>  Commonwealth  and  in  Queensland  in</span><span>  particular,  as  most  of  Australia's  beef</span><span>  exports  are  shipped  from  this  State.</span><span>  The  improvement  in  grading  ehould  re</span><span>  sult  in  better  returns  for  tho  best</span><span>  qualities  of  meat,  and  in  this  way  the</span><span>  producers  would  be  encouraged  to  breed</span><span>  the  best  beef  jpossible.  The  other  States</span><span>  are  more  interested  in  exporting  fat</span><span>  lambs  and  mutton,  but  theuame  remarks</span><span>  apply,  for  the  closest  attention  to  qual</span><span>  ity  in  the  overseas  markets  is  an  essen</span><span>  tial  if  the  maximum  prices  are  to  bt</span><span>  obtained.</span><span>  Dealing  with  country  killing,  it  may</span><span>  be  said  that  Queensland  is  placed  more</span><span>  advantageously  than  New  South  Wales</span><span>  owing  to  the  situations  of  works  at</span><span>  various  points  along  the  coast,  and</span></p> <p><span>  owners  in  the  fattening  districts  are</span><span>  enabled  to  have  their  stock  treated</span><span>  without  having  to  rail  them  for  such</span><span>  long  distances.  Even  under  Queensland</span><span>  conditions;  there  is  a  tremendous  waste</span><span>  through'  bruising,  and  it  is,  indeed,  a</span><span>  difficult  matte*  to  find  a  method  of</span><span>  overcoming  this  trouble  which  leads  to</span><span>  the  condemnation  or  rejection  of  a  large</span><span>  proportion  of  what  would  otherwise  be</span><span>  Buitable  meat  for  the  export  trade.  The</span><span>  advantages  of  polled  or  dehorned  cattle</span><span>  have  been  stressed  by  various  commis</span><span>  sions  on  this  matter,  but  recommenda</span><span>  tions  to  this  end  have  not  been  follow</span><span>  ed  by  the  average  graeier.  If  Now</span><span>  South  Wales  can  assist  in  reducing  the</span><span>  amount  of  spoiled  meat  the  result  should</span><span>  be  valuable  in  Queensland  also,  as  un</span><span>  der  existing  conditions  there  is  a  very</span><span>  considerable  wastage  which,  seems  to  be</span><span>  unavoidable,  and  naturally  the  producer</span><span>  pays  for.  all  this  byv  way  of  reduced</span><span>  returns.</span><span>  The  fourth  matter  for  consideration</span><span>  by  the  Board  concorns  the  question.  of</span><span>  whether  the  existing  .works  operate  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  interests  of  the  industry,  and  apply</span><span>  ing  this  to  Queensland  it  may  be  stated</span><span>  that  the  works  eujcy  a  high  reputation</span><span>  overseas  for  the  quality  of  their  exports,</span><span>  so  that  any  comments  made  by  the  New</span><span>  South  Wales  Board  will  not  apply  here.</span><span>  It  will  certainly  be  Interesting  to</span><span>  watch  any  innovations  instituted  by  the</span><span>  Board  after  its  report  has  been  pre</span><span>  sonted  to  the  Government,  but  it  is</span><span>  expected  that  in  Queensland  improve</span><span>  ment  in  the  meat  industry  will  follow</span><span>  more  through  the  introduction  of  im</span><span>  proved  methods  of  treatment  and  adop</span><span>  tion  of  standard  grading  than  by  Gov</span><span>  ernmental  control.</span></p> ",Article,1931-10-22,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

"<p><span>  THE  CENTRAL  QUEENSLAND  HERALD</span><span>  ROCKHAMPTON.</span><span>  THURSDAY,  SEPTEMBER  17,  1031,</span></p> <p><span>  OUR  HARDY  PREMIERS.</span></p> <p><span>  Our  Premiers  are  a  hardy  lot.  Be</span><span>  cause  delegates  from  the  Loan  Council</span><span>  to  the  Commonwealth  Bank  Board  did</span><span>  not  return  on  a  shutter,  the  circum</span><span>  stance  was  interpreted  to  indicate  that</span><span>  response  to  the  request  to  be  allowed,</span><span>  to  increase  the  overdraft  by  another</span><span>  £8,000,000  was  favourable.  The  facts</span><span>  probably  are  that,  (a)  the  Board's  faith</span><span>  in  Australian  Treasurers,  like  its  gold</span><span>  holding,  is  a  vanishing  quantity,  (b)</span></p> <p><span>  the  Board  has  been  studying  the  latest</span><span>  statistics  issued  by  the  Commonwealth</span><span>  Bureau  of  Census  and  Statistics,  and</span><span>  (c)  the  Board  has  not  that  amount  of</span><span>  loose  change  anyhow.</span><span>  For  the  fifteen  months  ending  March</span><span>  last  Australia  had  gained  in  natural</span><span>  increase  91,325  citizens  and  had  lost</span><span>  16,990  of  them  by  emigration.  That</span><span>  is  to  say,  not  only  has  immigration  in</span><span>  to  Australia  ceased,  but  a  strong  out</span><span>  ward  tide  of  emigration  has  developed.</span><span>  Without  Queensland,  .  which  gained</span></p> <p><span>  7260,  the  loss  would  have  been  just  un</span><span>  der  25,000.  This  development  suggests</span><span>  that  when  Australian  politicians  ex</span><span>  cuse  their  chaotic!  bunglings  on  the</span><span>  grounds  that  things  are  as  bad  else</span><span>  where  owing  to  a  'world-wide'  depresj</span><span>  sion,  there  still  remains  a  number  of</span><span>  people  who  are  prepared  to  risk  the</span><span>  worst  that  can  happen  to  them  over</span><span>  seas  rather  than  put  up  with  the  best</span><span>  tsat  politicians  in  Australia  can  pro</span><span>  vide  for  them.  '</span><span>  The  exodus  is  greatest  in  Lang's</span><span>  State,  though  all  of'  the  States  with</span><span>  the  exception  of  Queensland  and  the</span><span>  Federal  and  Northern  Territories  regis</span><span>  tered  losses.  The  Federal  Territory  is</span><span>  infested  mostly  with  politicians  and</span><span>  public  servants  engaged  in  making  des</span><span>  perate  efforts  to  solve  the  problem  of</span><span>  raising  the  wind  from  a  decreasing</span><span>  number  of  taxpayers,  eo  .'that  the  in</span><span>  creasing  percentage  of  Australia's</span><span>  population  who  have  to  be  ted  may.  be.</span><span>  kept  within  sight  of  the  bread-line.  In</span><span>  the  Northern  Territory  drought,  buf</span><span>  falo  fly,  haphazard  communications  Vai</span><span>  stunting  airmen  are  the  principal  af</span><span>  flictions,  and  the  scattered  inhabitants</span><span>  are  inured  to  these  minor  hardships.</span><span>  Only  insistent  demands  from  the  crazy</span><span>  south  for  money  keep  them  in  touch</span><span>  with  some  of  the  woes  of  their  south</span><span>  ern  brethren.  The  flight  of  population</span><span>  from  Lang's  State  is  understandable,</span><span>  and  only  lack  of  funds  prevents  a  lot</span><span>  of  people,  who  would  like  to  shake  the'</span><span>  dust  of  a  once-proud  State  .from  their</span><span>  battered  boots,  from  following  suit.</span><span>  The  trade  figures  are  equally  enlight</span><span>  ening.  Imports  fell  off  by  £70,623,000</span><span>  between  1930  and  1931,  and  we  were  as</span><span>  sured  that  the  only  thing  necessary  to</span><span>  ensure  Australian  factories  turning  out</span><span>  tie  goods  previously  imported  was  either</span><span>  an  embargo  against,  or  a  towering  duty</span><span>  on,  similar  imported  goods.  The  thing</span><span>  was  easy,  and  the  Fordes  and  Theodores</span><span>  set  about  abolishing  unemployment  in</span><span>  Australia  'by  tinkering  with  the  tariff.</span><span>  But  Australian  factories  last  year  turned</span><span>  out  £20,632,000  less  goods  than  for  1929,</span><span>  so  that  instead  of  absorbing  .some  of</span><span>  the  seventy  millions  by  -which  'imports</span><span>  fell  away,  decreased  output  from  Aus^</span><span>  tralian  factories  added  to  the  .  lessened</span><span>  consumption.

No  Go</span><span>  vernment  can,  from  the  point  of  view</span><span>  of  rehabilitating  the  industry  of  a  na</span><span>  tiou,  expend  money  to  the  same  advant</span><span>  age  as  can  the  private  individual.

They  re</span><span>  ceive  on  an  average  a  considerably  higher</span><span>  wage  than  that  paid  to  factory  em</span><span>  ployees,  and,  despite  the  crisis  through  '</span><span>  .which  we  are  passing  and  the  emphatic</span><span>  denunciations  of  the  president  of  the</span><span>  State  Servants'  Union,  the  average  rate</span><span>  has  increased.

Added  to  the  higher</span><span>  average  salary,  the  result  is  thai  civil</span></p> <p><span>  servants  have  worked  15  per  cent  less</span><span>  time  than  factory  employees  for  22  per</span><span>  cent  more  pay  in  1926,  and  the  posi</span><span>  tion  had  improved  for  them  in  1929</span><span>  to  the  extent  that  they  still  worked  15</span><span>  per  cent  less  timo  than  private  em</span><span>  ployees,  and  received  30  per  cent  more</span><span>  for  doing  it.  On  the  basis  of  factory</span><span>  ?wages  and,  civil  service  hours,  the  pub</span><span>  lic  service  of  Queensland  was  overpaid</span><span>  in  1926  by  about  £109  per  annum,  and</span><span>  in  1929  by  slightly  under  £100  per  an</span><span>  num.

In  as  many  States  six  fumbling</span></p> <p><span>  Governments  are  resting,  as  though  in</span><span>  complacent  contemplation  of  the  fact</span><span>  that,  as  the  Eky  did  not  fall  when  the</span><span>  h  mazing  documents  were  produced,</span><span>  they  are  eafe  in  their  billets  for  an</span><span>  other  year.  Meanwhile,  the  growing</span><span>  hordes  of  tax  gatherers  are  redoubling</span><span>  their  efforts  as  new  —  if  scanty  —  pas-</span><span>  tures  are  opened  to  them  by  small  co</span><span>  teries  of  men  who  would  not  flinch,  did</span><span>  «MMion  demand,  to  decree  by  Act  of</span><span>  Parliament  that  the  world  is  square.</span><span>  The  accumulated  efforts  of  the  whole</span><span>  of  them  have  harassed  every  trade,</span><span>  worried  every  profession,  and  assailed</span><span>  or  menaced  every  class,  .  institution,  and</span><span>  species  of  property  in  the  country.</span><span>  The  Queensland  budget  is  £1,800,000</span><span>  short  of  balancing,  despite  the  fact</span><span>  that  it  is  acclaimed  on  her  behalf  that</span><span>  no  other  State  is  so  stable.  It  is  fur</span><span>  ther  announced  that  a  hoard  of  loan</span><span>  money  will  bridge  the  gap  until  the</span><span>  end  of  December,  after  which  anything</span><span>  might  transpire.  This  hoard,  by  the</span><span>  way,  is  the  very  one  which  Forgan</span><span>  Smith  and  his  satellites  fiercely  de</span><span>  manded  Bhould  have  been  spent,  in</span><span>  which  case  we  would  still  have  had</span></p> <p><span>  the  deficit  without  the  hoard.  In  the</span><span>  meantime,  Cabinet  meets  each  week  in</span><span>  deeper  gloom  and  announces,  after</span><span>  deep  consultation  with  its  taxation</span><span>  scouts,  that  no  new  sources  of  wealth</span><span>  have  been  located,  that  once  flowing</span><span>  streams  of  revenue  are  drying  up,  and</span><span>  that  people  who  once  paid  taxation</span><span>  ?re  now  receiving  the  dole.  That  things</span><span>  are  even  worse  in  other  States  is</span><span>  proved  by  absence  of  any  tidings  of</span><span>  newly-discovered  wealth,  and  the  know</span><span>  ledge  that  all  wealth  discovered  to</span><span>  date  has  been  either  spent  or  is  mort</span><span>  gaged.</span><span>  Periodically  a  string  of  State  Pre</span><span>  miers  and  Treasurers  converge  on</span><span>  Melbourne  or  Canberra  to  sit  in  con</span><span>  ference  as  the  Loan  Council.  The  ac</span></p> <p><span>  cepted  view  is  that  the  financial  brains</span><span>  of  the  nation  arc  then  focusscd  on</span><span>  Australia's  financial  problems.  The</span><span>  melancholy  fact  is  that  there  prob</span><span>  ably  is  not  in  the  length  and  breadth</span><span>  of  Australia  a  body  of  men  less  re</span><span>  sourceful  in  support  for  a  faltering</span><span>  nation.  The  principle  of  representa</span><span>  tion  on  the  Loan  Council  is  that  of  a</span><span>  coalition  Government,  yet  none  of  the</span><span>  Governments  which  have  representation</span><span>  on  the  Council  have  thought  of  apply</span><span>  ing  the  same  principle  to  their  own</span><span>  States.  The  sweets  of  office,  whatever</span><span>  the  state  of  the  nation,  are  not  to  be</span><span>  shared  with  political  opponents.</span><span>  Regarded  as  a  body  charged  with  the</span><span>  portentous  -luty  of  rehabilitating  Aus</span><span>  tralian  finance  aud  industry,  the  com</span><span>  position  of  the  Australian  Loan  Coun</span><span>  cil  would  be  a  joke  were  it  not  really</span><span>  «  tragedy.  With  reservations  for  re</span><span>  cent  members  of  Governments  whose</span><span>  political  infancy  is  such  that  they  can</span><span>  not  be  classed  among  the  'front  rank</span><span>  ers'  in  Australian  thriftlessness,  the</span><span>  whole  of  the  members  have  either</span><span>  countenanced  or  endorsed  financial  poli</span><span>  cies  that  reckoned  not  of  the  future.</span><span>  Neither  did  they  take  heed  of  the</span><span>  past,  to  the  extent  that  its  lessons</span><span>  were  to  them  .a  sealed  book.  The  least</span><span>  cuiltv  amors  them  have  issued  period</span></p> <p><span>  ically  statements  of  State  finance  that</span><span>  would  bring  them  in  conflict  with  the</span><span>  registrar  of  companies  were  they  to</span><span>  present  similar  documents  in  respect</span><span>  to  private  companies,  and  the  higher</span><span>  flights  of  financial  misdoing  of  members</span><span>  range  from  currency  inflation  to  repu</span><span>  diation.  The  Federal  members  at  least</span><span>  (Messrs.  Scullin  and  Theodore)  are</span><span>  obviously  dominated  by  influences  that</span><span>  owe  no  allegiance  to  the  general  body</span><span>  of  electors,  and  the  ??  Lang  representa</span><span>  tives  owe  allegiance  only  to  Lang.</span><span>  Hence  it  is  that?  the  Loan  Council,</span><span>  when  it  lost  its  ability  to  lend,  became</span><span>  a  mockery  and  a  sham.  Its  deliberations</span><span>  and  agreetoents—  if  any—  have  to  run  the</span><span>  gauntlet;  of  obscure  forces  -which  already</span><span>  have  discarded  one  plan  and  emasculated</span><span>  others.  -There  is  no  guarantee  that  any</span><span>  State  will  take  seriously  the  decisions</span><span>  of  the  Council,  or  that  it  possesses  tut</span></p> <p><span>  dynamic  force  to  either  conceive  a  way</span><span>  out  of  our  troubles,  or  to  put  one  into</span><span>  effect  if  someone  else  gave  it  to  the</span><span>  tragic  body.  The  only  dynamic  force  is</span><span>  Lang,  and  he  seems  to  get  from  it  most</span><span>  things  on  which  he  sets  his  mind.  He</span><span>  compelled  the  Loan  Council  to  pay  his</span><span>  debts  by  the  simple  process  of  repudiat</span><span>  ing  them,  aud  by  dint  of  hard  spending</span></p> <p><span>  in  the  past  lias  placed  his  State  first  on</span><span>  the  list  for  apportioning  the  pathetically</span><span>  small  loan  the  Commonwealth  Bank</span><span>  tossed  to  tlic  eager  suppliants.</span><span>  Last  meeting  of  the  Loan  Council  was</span><span>  the  first  after  details  of  the  huge  con</span><span>  version  loan  were  available.  It  was</span><span>  then  known  that  the  neoDle  of  Australia</span></p> <p><span>  had  presented  to  their  harassed  Govern</span><span>  ments  some  millions  of  interest.  It  was</span><span>  an  annual  gift,  that  reduced  the  spend</span><span>  ing  power  of  private  individuals  to  the</span><span>  Eame  extent  that  it  increased  that  of</span><span>  Governments,  yet  the  amazing  body</span><span>  made  no  mention  of  the  sacrifice  beyond</span><span>  devising  means  by  which  to  run  to  earth</span><span>  the  dissentients.  It  was  a  time  for</span><span>  statesmanlike  mention  of  the  ready  re</span><span>  sponse  of  the  people  to  agree  to  abro</span><span>  gating  definite  agreements,  yet  the  ouly</span><span>  reference  to  the  matter  was  in  respect</span><span>  to  punitive  measures  by  which  to  discip</span><span>  line  those  who,  for  any  number  of  rea</span><span>  Eons,  did  not  agree  to  a  sacrifice  which,</span><span>  for  all  that  is  known  to  the  contrary,</span><span>  might  be  beyond  their  means  or  capacity</span><span>  to  make.</span><span>  This  is  the  astonishing  body  to  which</span><span>  Australia  looks  to  disencumber  her  of</span><span>  her  difficulties.  It  might  be  admitted</span><span>  that  its  members  are  conscientious  ac</span><span>  cording  to  their  lights.  But  their  lights</span><span>  are  very  dim  glimmers,  and  bear  no  re</span><span>  semblance  to  the  torch  that  will  both</span><span>  guide  the  nation  and  give  hope  to  its</span><span>  people.</span></p> ",Article,1931-10-01,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

They  may  be  summarised  as  fol</span><span>  lows:  —</span><span>  1.  The  regulation  of  shipments  so  as</span><span>  to  keep  a  steady  flow  of  meat  to  the</span><span>  British  market  throughout  the  year.</span><span>  ?1.  The  employment  of  a  special  repre</span><span>  sentative  whose  duties  include  main</span><span>  taining  and  extending  the  connec</span><span>  tion.</span><span>  3.  The  control  of  arrangements  regard</span><span>  ing  storage  in  Britain.</span><span>  The  importance  of  these  operations  can</span><span>  scarcely  be  exaggerated,  for  it  is  evident</span><span>  that  one  of  the  essentials  of  an  expan</span><span>  sion  of  the  meat  trade  must  be  the  re</span><span>  gulation  of  shipping  so  as  to  keep  a</span><span>  steady  flow  to  the  consuming  centres</span><span>  over  the  whole  year,  having  due  regard</span><span>  to  the  fluctuations  which  occur  in  nor</span><span>  mal  periods.  The  regularity  and  con</span><span>  tinuity  of  supplies  must  be  important</span><span>  factors  in  achieving  success  in  the  Bri</span><span>  tish  market,  and  in  New  Zealand  the</span><span>  authority  of  the  Meat  Board  has  been</span><span>  a  valuable  agent  towards  this  end.  Un</span><span>  der  its  statutory  powers  all  freight  ar</span><span>  rangements  are  left  to  its  discretion,</span><span>  and  this  privilege  at  once  gives  it  ade</span><span>  quate  control  of  all  supplies.  This  is</span><span>  no  light  undertaking,  as  the  New  Zea</span><span>  land  annual  output  of  lamb  and  ~  mut</span><span>  ton  amounts  to  nearly  10,000,000  car</span><span>  cases,  which  are  loaded  from  various</span><span>  ports  in  the  Dominion  for  different  desti</span><span>  nations.  The  task  of  spreading  the  ar</span><span>  rivals  evenly  calls  for  special  organisa</span><span>  tion  after  taking  into  account  the  6p*eeds</span><span>  and  routes  by  which  each  consignment</span><span>  Bhould  proceed  towards  the  British  mar</span><span>  ket.  It  is  easier  in  New  Zealand  to</span><span>  obtain  satisfactory  results  from  such</span><span>  control  than  it  would  be  in  the  Com</span><span>  monwealth.  Whereas  New  Zealand  has</span><span>  much  of  its  territory  given  to  the  pro</span><span>  duction  of  meat  for  export,  Australia</span><span>  is  on  a  totally  different  footing.  Queens</span><span>  land  is  practically  the  only  Eastern</span><span>  Stuie  which  exports  beef  on  a  large</span><span>  scale-,  while  New  South  Wales,  Victoria</span><span>  tuid  South  Australia  are  far  ahead  in</span><span>  the  mutton  and  lamb  trades.  In  all</span><span>  the  States  production  is  dependent  upon</span><span>  favourable  seasonal  conditions.</span><span>  It  is  thus  a  more  difficult  proposi</span><span>  tion  for  Australia  to  organise  its  meat</span><span>  «..?*.  ...4-o  en  fliof  4-llnTT  eliall  lift  flVA.iin.hlft</span></p> <p><span>  regularly  and  consistently  for  British</span><span>  consumers,  when  there  are  definite  ex</span><span>  port  seasons  and  when  weather  condi</span><span>  tions  exert  such  a  powerful  influence</span><span>  thereon.  But  the  subject  is  worthy  of</span><span>  attention,  for  success  cannot  be  achieved</span><span>  until  the'  markets  are  assured  of  more</span><span>  regular  supplies.  As  it  is,  the  bene</span><span>  ficial  effects  of  a  good  exporting  season</span><span>  are  partially  neutralised  by  irregular</span><span>  shipments,  which  result  in  the  loss  of</span><span>  custom.  The  New  Zealand  Board  is  em</span><span>  phatic  on  this  point,  stressing  its</span><span>  cogency  in  the  annual  report:  —  .</span><span>  ''There  can  be  no  question  that  re</span><span>  gularity  and  continuity  of  supplies</span><span>  it  ro  f  lio  ms^cf  imnnrfo  nf  f  nnfnva  in  fVin</span></p> <p><span>  attainment  of  success  in  the  British</span><span>  market,  and  the  authority  exercised</span><span>  by  the  Board  over  shipments  in  this</span><span>  way  is  probably  the  most  valuable</span><span>  work  it  has  undertaken.'</span><span>  With  its  experience  of  regulating  its</span><span>  own  shipments,  and  watching  the  ar</span><span>  rivals  of  meat  into  Britain  from  foreign</span><span>  producers,  the  New  Zealand  Meat  Board</span><span>  has  been  able  to  keep  the  different  mar</span><span>  kets  steadily  supplied  with  their  re</span><span>  quirements,  and  it  has  found  that,  with</span><span>  the  assistance  of  a  permanent,  represen</span><span>  tative  to  maintain  contact  with  cus</span><span>  fomprfl.  tlm  volume  of  sales  has  mounted</span></p> <p><span>  consistently.  Moreover,  it  has  been  able</span><span>  to  obtain  advantageous  rates  for  cold</span><span>  storage  and  as  the  volume  of  meat  un</span><span>  der  its  control  increases  so  will  its  oppor</span><span>  tunities  expand  for  commanding  even</span><span>  more  favourable  accommodation,  which</span><span>  Will  allow  reduced  marketing  coats'  as</span><span>  ?n  offset  against  the  lower  proceeds  now]</span><span>  obtainable^'*  '  -??  i.-  ?  ??  :.  -</span></p> <p><span>  An  institution  Buch  as  the  New  Zea</span><span>  land  Meat  Producers'  Board  is  cf  de</span><span>  cided  importance  in  marketing  meat  in</span><span>  the  United  Kingdom,  and  it  would  as</span><span>  sist  the  Australian  graziers  if  some  such</span><span>  institution  were  developed  in  this  coun</span><span>  try.

The  de</span><span>  tails,  really  are  more  important  tliau</span><span>  the  vote,  because  any  caucus  or  other</span></p> <p><span>  body  sufficiently  hungry  for  money  and</span><span>  contemptuous  of  the  consequences  can</span><span>  pass  a  vote;  but  it  is  quite  another</span><span>  matter  to  reconcile  such  vote  with</span><span>  world  practice,  or  the  wish  for  easy</span><span>  money  with  its  consummation.</span><span>  The  matter  lay  dormant  until  last</span><span>  week,  when  Dr.  William:  Maloney,</span><span>  ?f.H.R.  (Melbourne)  enunciated  his</span><span>  scheme  for  making  money  out  of  coin</span><span>  ing  silver.  His  project  is  to  purchase</span><span>  at  Is.  per  ounce  silver  that  is  worth</span><span>  Is.  4d.,  and  from  it  make  mint  cur</span><span>  rency  that  would  be  worth  5s.  6d.  With</span><span>  this  the  intention  is  to  purchase  wheat</span><span>  at  4s.  per  bushel  —  although  the  same</span><span>  wheat  is  now  priced  at  2s.  7d.  —  and</span><span>  sell  it  overseas  at  2s.  after  paying  all</span><span>  freight  charges.  The  project  is  based</span><span>  upon  paying  the  silver  miner  4d,  per</span><span>  ounce  less  for  his  silver  than  its  mar</span><span>  ket  value,  and  the,  wheat  grower  Is.  Cd.</span><span>  per  bushel  more  for  his  wheat  than  its</span><span>  market  value.  Neither  of  these  values</span><span>  is  stable,  and  both  are  liable  to  violent</span><span>  fluctuations  at  short  notice—  or  at</span><span>  none.  The  worthy  doctor  is  caught  up</span><span>  in  the  minting  profits,  and  overlooks</span><span>  the  fact  that  even  greater  profits  are</span><span>  possible  through  printing  symbols  on</span><span>  paper  and  calling  it  money.  The  in</span><span>  evitable  effect  —  inflation  —  is  the  same</span><span>  in  both  cases.</span><span>  Following  this  announcement  came  a</span><span>  considered  article  on  the  bi-metal  cur</span><span>  rency  from  the  Federal  Treasurer,  Mr.</span><span>  Theodore.  That  it  is  a  new  outlook  or</span><span>  aspect  of  our  financial  difficulties  from</span><span>  these  previously  enunciated  by  .  him</span><span>  makes  it  no  lfess  worthy  of  attention.</span><span>  He  has  both  denounced  and  advocated</span><span>  paper  inflation,  and  the  fact  that  he</span><span>  now  fences  guardedly  round  silver  in</span><span>  flation  does  no  more  than  suggest  a</span><span>  like  elasticity  of  opinion  with  respect</span><span>  to  it.</span><span>  What  is  not  clear  at  this  juncture  is</span><span>  why,  having  decided  that  there  should</span><span>  be  a  monetary  standard,  there  should</span><span>  be  more  than  one.  There  is  no  alter</span><span>  native  standard  of  weight  or  measure.</span><span>  A  pound  avoirdupois  is  sixteen  ounces,</span><span>  and  a  foot  is  twelve  inches,  and  it</span><span>  would  create  untold,  confusion  in  valu</span><span>  ing  commodities  were  departure  from</span><span>  those  elements  made  either  optional</span><span>  or  possible.  It  is  suggested  by  Mr.</span><span>  Theodore  that  both  gold  and  silver</span><span>  would  not  simultaneously  —</span><span>  '...  be  subject  to  the  same  vaga</span><span>  ries  of  scarcity,  inequality  of  distri</span><span>  bution,  immobilation,  or  sudden  va</span><span>  riations  in  the  rate  of  production,</span><span>  which  are  the  attributes,  in  greater</span><span>  or  less  degree,  of  every  commodity</span><span>  produced  by  human  labour.'</span><span>  Both  gold  and  silver  are,  as  to  their</span><span>  production,  governed  by  the  same  in</span><span>  centive  an  governs  production  of  other</span><span>  commodities.  If  the  reward  is  suffi</span><span>  cient  a  man  produces  potatoes  or  beef</span><span>  or  copper  or  gold.  If  he  overproduces</span><span>  all  or  any  of  them  the  price  falls  and</span><span>  the  diminished  reward  no  longer  at</span><span>  tracts.  That  explains  why  silver  that</span><span>  in  1928  was  worth  2s.  2{d.  per  ounce</span><span>  is  now  worth  only  Is.  4d.  It  also  ex</span><span>  plains  why  gold  that  in  1028  brought</span><span>  £4  5s.  per  ounce  is  now  worth  £5  4s.</span><span>  6d.  To  suggest  using  silver  as  an  al</span><span>  ternative  standard  because  of  its  cheap</span><span>  ness,  does  not  offer  a  rational  reason</span><span>  for  departing  from  the  gold  standard</span><span>  because  of  its  dearncas.  The  bedrock</span><span>  of  the  matter  is  that  r.cbody  wants</span><span>  silver.  It  has  been  replaced  in  com</span><span>  merce  by  Alloys  innumerable,  by  elec</span><span>  troplated  ware,  and  by  high  grade</span><span>  china.  Improved  processes  for  its  ex</span><span>  t  .  sfcion  have  brought  down  the  value</span><span>  of  silver,  and  a  new  demand  for  1000</span><span>  tons  annually—  production  for  the  last</span><span>  half-dozen  years  .has  been  About  7000</span><span>  tons  annually,  nearly  half  of  it  from</span><span>  Mexico—  would  not  be  difficult  to  'meet.</span><span>  Mr.  Theodore  states  that  because</span><span>  the  average  production  of  silver  is</span><span>  about  fifteen  times  that  of  gold,  its</span><span>  present  ratio  of  value  to  gold  of  about</span><span>  M  to  1  is  not  logical.  He  ignores  the</span><span>  potential  production  of  silver,  and  also,</span><span>  that  its  present  value  is  fixed  by  com</span></p> <p><span>  mercial  demand  and  not  by  its  minting</span><span>  possibilities.  His  suggestion  of  gradu</span><span>  ally  appreciating  the  value  of  silver  to</span><span>  its  ratio  to  gold  production  would  mean</span><span>  that  silver—  on  present  gold  prices  —</span><span>  would  be  worth  7s.  per  ounce,  which</span><span>  would  bring  about  a  world  production</span><span>  of  silver  for  which  no  use  could  be</span><span>  found.</span><span>  One  other  suggestion  is  that  of  a</span><span>  multiple  standard  based  upon  a  long</span><span>  range  value:</span><span>  '...  of  those  commodities  which</span><span>  enter  into  international  trade,  such</span><span>  as  iron  and  steel,  cotton,  wool,  meat,</span><span>  coffee,  sugar,  jute,  rubber,  rice  and</span><span>  metals,  would  be  an  ideal  standard</span><span>  if  sufficient  countries  could  be  in</span><span>  duced  to  adopt  it.'</span><span>  The  first  essential  for  such  a  stan</span><span>  dard  would  be  equalised  tariffs,  stan</span><span>  dards,  costs  of  production,  and</span><span>  methods  of  distribution  in  various</span><span>  countries.  In  Australia  our  tariff</span><span>  would  be  swept  away,  as  such  a  stan</span><span>  dard  could  not  long  survive  different</span><span>  values  placed  upon  the  same  commodi</span><span>  ty  in  different  countries.  For  instance,</span><span>  we  have  at  Iron  Knob,  South  Austra</span><span>  lia,  abundant  deposits  of  iron  ore  so</span><span>  rich  that  horseshoes  have  been  forged</span><span>  from  the  raw  ore.  Yet  the  iron  and</span><span>  steel  industry  in  Australia  is  among</span><span>  the  most  highly  protected.  Millions  of</span><span>  pounds'  worth  of  beef  and  wool  have</span><span>  been  produced  on  grasses  that  nature</span><span>  gave  us,  yet  we  compete  in  the  world's</span><span>  markets  only  by  taxing  Australian</span><span>  beef  consumers  in  one  case,  and  be</span><span>  cause  of  having  a  world  monopoly  of</span><span>  fine  wool  in  the  other.  A  standard</span><span>  based  upon  a  variety  of  commodities</span><span>  as  wide  as  Mr.  Theodore  suggests,  (</span><span>  would  be  stable  only  if  standard  costs  (</span><span>  of  production  also  were  accepted.  As</span><span>  he  suggests,  it  would  be  tremendously,</span><span>  difficult  to  get  any  number  of  coun</span><span>  tries  to  accept  such  a  standard  and  all</span><span>  it  implies.  It  would  be  more  than  Mr.</span><span>  Theodore's  prospects  of  retaining  his  i</span><span>  seat  at  next  election  to  try  and  enforce</span><span>  such  agreement  in  Australia.</span><span>  The  discussion  has  at  least  one</span><span>  value.  It  points  clearly  to  a  new</span><span>  effort  in  inflation.  The  danger  in  in</span><span>  flation  through  silver  is  no  less  than</span><span>  through  paper  or,  for  that  matter,</span><span>  through  gold  itself,  if  gold  were  suffi</span><span>  ciently  plentiful.  In  the  United  States</span></p> <p><span>  there  are  tons  of  gold  lying  frozen  be</span><span>  cause  of  the  inflation  its  use  in  cur</span><span>  rency  would  precipitate.  Used  as  cur</span><span>  rency  there  is  nothing  to  prevent  the  :</span><span>  same  accumulation  in  the  United  States</span><span>  of  silver,  the  only  difference  being  that</span><span>  vault  room  would  be  at  a  premium.</span><span>  The  prime  factor  in  accumulating  gold</span><span>  in  the  United  States  was  that  gold  was</span><span>  the  standard  of  value.  It  thus</span><span>  was  value  which  was  accumulated,</span><span>  and  gold  measures  it  no  better  or  more</span><span>  conclusively  than  would  eighty  times</span><span>  the  volume  of  silver.  For  the  same</span><span>  reason,  it  is  the  value  and  confidence</span><span>  behind  paper  currency,  and  not  the  fa</span><span>  cility  with  which  it  is  printed  that</span><span>  gives  it  its  currency  importance,  and</span><span>  any  attempt  to  create  currency  of  any</span><span>  kind  without  corresponding  value  or</span><span>  confidence  to  support  it,  is  merely  in</span><span>  flation  in  another  guise.</span></p> ",Article,1931-11-05,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

The  Mt.  Morgan  Gold  Mining</span><span>  Company,  Ltd.  This  was  the  original</span><span>  company,  formed  in  1883  that  went</span><span>  recently  in  voluntary  liquidation  and</span><span>  disposed  of  its  assets.</span><span>  2.  Mt.  Morgan  Ltd.,  formed  in  1929.</span><span>  It  bought  all  the  mining  rights  and</span><span>  assets  at  Mt.  Morgan  from  the  ori</span><span>  ginal  company,  and  proceeded  to  re</span><span>  cover  copper  from  water  in  the  mine</span><span>  by  precipitation.</span><span>  3.  Mt.  Morgan  Gold  Recoveries,  No</span><span>  Liability,  now  being  floated  for  the</span><span>  purpose  of  working  portion  of  the</span><span>  mine  which  has  been  purchased  from</span><span>  Mt.  Morgan  Ltd.  This  portion  in</span><span>  cludes  the  whole  of  the  ore  on  and</span><span>  above  the  Linda  level.</span><span>  Should  the  present  'float'  be  suc-</span><span>  cessful,  there  will  be  working  at  Mt.</span><span>  Morgan  two  companies  :  one  on  the  cop</span><span>  per-charged  water  that  lies  in  the  lower</span><span>  levels  of  the  mine,  and  the  other  on  ore</span><span>  from  the  upper  levels.</span><span>  First  impressions  are  that  the  second</span><span>  company  is  superfluous,  and  proposes  to</span><span>  do  no  more  than  Mt.  Morgan  Ltd.  might</span><span>  have  performed.  Against  this  it  might</span><span>  be  urged  that  new  capital  was  needed</span><span>  which  Mt.  Morgan  Ltd.  was  unable  to</span><span>  raise,  so  that  company  gave  to  General</span><span>  Securities  (Aust.)  Ltd.  an  option  over</span><span>  the  ore  above  the  Linda  level.  The</span><span>  consideration  was  25,000  fully  paid  4s.</span><span>  shares  in  the  new  company  and  partici</span><span>  pation  in  certain  portions  of  the  profits</span><span>  of  that  company.  For  the  option  so</span><span>  attained,  General  Securities  (Aust.)</span><span>  Ltd.  is  receiving  from  Mt.  Morgan  Gold</span><span>  Recoveries  75,000  fuliy  paid  4s.  shares</span><span>  in  part  payment  for  the  acquisition</span><span>  of  the  option  and  for  promotion  and</span><span>  underwriting.  The  other  part  of  the</span><span>  payment  does  not  appear  to  be  men</span><span>  tioned  in  the  prospectus,  in  addition</span><span>  to  which  the  new  company  is  to  pay  re</span><span>  gistration  fees,  cost  of  printing  the</span><span>  prospectus,  and  slightly  better  than  8½</span><span>  per  cent,  brokerage.  Discounting  the</span><span>  shares  to  be  issued  to  Mt.  Morgan  Ltd,</span><span>  printing  and  registering,  the  visible</span><span>  overhead  amounts  to.  £15,000  (75,000</span><span>  paid  up  shares  to  General  Securities),</span><span>  and  £4166  (brokerage  at  4d.  per  share</span><span>  on  250.000  shares),  a  total  of  £19,168</span><span>  or  24  per  cent,  of  the  nominal  capi</span><span>  tal.</span><span>  The  question  here  -  is  whether  or  not</span><span>  the  new  company  is  paying  too  high</span><span>  for  its  capital.  In  other  words,  whether</span><span>  Mt.  Morgan  Ltd.,  for  less  cost,  could</span><span>  not  have  raised  £80,000  for  the  work</span><span>  it  is  proposed  will  be  carried  out  by</span><span>  the  new  company.  We  are  informed</span><span>  that  this  was  not  likely.'  The  point  is,</span><span>  however,  being  raised,-  and  we  are  hope-</span><span>  ful  that  further  information  on  these</span><span>  subjects  will  be  forthcoming.</span><span>  On  the  matter  of  the  gold  bonus,  the</span><span>  prospectus  does  not  state  whether  ex</span><span>  traction  of  gold  and  copper  from  the</span><span>  concentrates  is  to  be  carried  out  in  Aus</span><span>  tralia  or  in  America.  We  learn  from</span><span>  Mr.  Boyd  that  the  extraction  will  be</span><span>  carried  out  abroad,  and  that  the  gold</span><span>  is,  notwithstanding,  entitled  to  bonus.</span><span>  Also,  it  shows  that,  without  this</span><span>  factor,  the  proposition  is  an  attractive</span><span>  one.</span><span>  The  objects  of  the  company  appear</span><span>  eminently  practical.  The  body  of  ore</span><span>  has  been  abundantly  proved,  together</span><span>  with  its  assay  values  and  susceptibility</span><span>  to  treatment.  There  are  no  unknown</span><span>  natural  difficulties  to  be  expected,  there</span><span>  probably  being  more  surveys  of  the</span><span>  ore-bearing  portion  of  Mt.  Morgan  than</span><span>  of  any  other  part  of  the  State,  All</span><span>  the  usual  facilities  for  mining  are  either</span><span>  at  hand,  or  else  their  availability  has</span></p> <p><span>  been  taken  into  account  when  comput</span><span>  ing  costs.  There  is  no  reason  whatever</span><span>  why,  on  the  assurance  of  Mr.  Boyd,  the</span><span>  output  and  treatment  should  not  come</span><span>  up  to  expectations.  Returns  are  based</span><span>  upon  a  conservative  price  for  copper,</span><span>  that  for  gold  being,  of  course,  fixed.</span><span>  With  so  few  undetermined,  factors</span><span>  the  estimates  of  Mr.  Boyd  should  be</span><span>  reliable.  They  at  least  should  not  err</span><span>  on  the  side  of  over-optimism,  so  often</span><span>  the  downfall  of  new  mining  ventures.</span><span>  We  feel  convinced  they  do  not,  and  also</span><span>  that  the  desired  light  on  the  several</span><span>  points  we  have  raised  will  be  forthcom</span><span>  ing,  thus  removing  from  the  minds  of</span><span>  the  investing  public  any  doubts  that</span><span>  may  at  present  be  confronting  them.</span></p> ",Article,1931-06-04,"THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND HERALD ROCKHAMPTON.

Sir  Arthur  became  in</span><span>  timately  acquainted  with  Australian  con</span><span>  ditions  as  a  member  of  the  British  Eco</span><span>  nomic  Mission  two  years  ajgo,  so  that  hi3</span><span>  utterances  carry  more  weight  than  would</span><span>  be  the  case  with  most  Englishmen,  whose</span><span>  knowledge  has  been  gleaned  from  afar.</span><span>  Sir  Arthur  submits  four  reasons  why</span><span>  he  considers  that  the  Commonwealth</span><span>  ™-;il  vint  Anfaull  Tim  fl  ref  nf  fhncn  is</span></p> <p><span>  pride  of  country  and  British  descent,</span><span>  which  undoubtedly  embraces  many  sen</span><span>  timental  and  honourable  precepts  in</span><span>  stilled  into  the  minds  of  the  vast  ma</span><span>  jority  of  Australians.  But  whether</span><span>  they  are  of  concern  to  the  militant  mino</span><span>  rity  led  by  Mr.  Lang  is  a  different  mat</span><span>  ter.  As  he  holds  office  in  New  South</span><span>  Wales  it  is  his  whim  which  will  be  fol</span><span>  lowed,  and  national  prestige  can  go</span><span>  bang  so  far  as  that  State  is  concerned.</span><span>  The  second  reason  mentioned  is  that</span><span>  'I  cannot  conceive  that  Britian  will  not</span><span>  absist  the  Dominions  in  a  time  of  stress,</span><span>  because  the  default  of  anyone  will  direct</span><span>  ly  affect  the  Empire's  status.'  This  re</span><span>  flects  Australia's  chief  hope  at  this  cri</span><span>  tical  juncture.  It  has  become  apparent</span><span>  to  everyone  with  sufficient  knowledge  of</span><span>  the  facts  that  Australia  must  receive</span><span>  financial  assistance  6ooner  or  later  if</span><span>  the  situation  is  not  to  gat  out  o'f  con</span><span>  trol  altogether.  The  Commonwealth  ha9</span><span>  so  far  been  extremely  fortunate  in  that</span><span>  there  have  not  been  any  external  loans</span><span>  maturing  abroad  since  the  commence</span><span>  ment  of  the  depression.  But  when  these</span><span>  loans  do  mature  a  renewal  would  be  well</span><span>  nigj  impossible  on  tue  ordinary  financial</span><span>  market,  and  as  the  Commonwealth  does</span><span>  not  possess  the  money  for  redemption</span><span>  help  must  be  forthcoming  from  some</span><span>  quarter  to  avoid  .  default,  not  only  for</span><span>  New  South  Wales,  but  the  whole  of  Aus</span><span>  tarlia.  Even  as  a  matter  of  self-interest,</span><span>  this  help  is  necessary  from  a  British</span><span>  vie  .point,  as  the  loss  to  investors  and</span><span>  the  trading  classes  would  otherwise  be  j</span><span>  enormous,  and  the  aid  granted  would  I</span><span>  operate  on  protection  of  the  British  cre</span><span>  ditors  themselves.  The  difficulty,  how</span><span>  ever,  is  to  know  which  section  of  the</span><span>  community  should  grant  the  required</span><span>  aid.  Certainly  the  investing  classes</span><span>  would  not  subscribe,  as  they  have  already  j</span><span>  suffered  heavy  losses  through  the  deprc-  j</span><span>  ciation  of  Australian  securities;  th^</span><span>  British  Government  has  troubles  of  its  '</span><span>  own,  and  finds  its  own  budgets  just  as</span><span>  hard  to  balance  as  does  the  Common</span><span>  wealth;  and  the  Bunk  of  England,  whicb</span><span>  is  the  most  likely  source,  has  been'</span><span>  snubbed  through  the  repudiation  of  the</span><span>  Melbourne  agreement  suggested  by  its</span><span>  accredited  representative,  Sir  Otto  Nei</span><span>  meyer,  as  the  inescapable  basis  of  re</span><span>  covery.</span><span>  Unfortunately,  Australia's  present</span><span>  leaders  have  made  no  alternative  propo</span><span>  sals  to  Britain  t-%  tide  them  over  their</span><span>  present  difficulties.  They  hav.e  continu</span><span>  ously  sounded  the  world's  money  mar</span><span>  kets  end  found  them  unfavourably  dis</span><span>  posed  towards  this  country,  and  they</span><span>  have  attempted  to  develop  independent</span><span>  .-  policies,  experimenting  along  lines</span><span>  which  —  though  trumpeted  as  effectual</span><span>  cures  for  linancial  and  industrial  ills  —</span><span>  actually  lead  deeper  into  the  slough.  Mr.</span><span>  Lang,  when  he  does  recover  some  scnib;,</span><span>  lance  of  sanity,  may  retrace  his  steps,</span><span>  but  the  longer  the  delay  the  more  diffi</span><span>  cult  the  task,  for  naturally  any  assist</span><span>  ance  granted  will  be  on  such  conditions</span></p> <p><span>  and  safeguards  as  Great  Britain  may</span><span>  stipulate.</span><span>  Sir  Arthur's  third  reason  is  that  Aus</span><span>  tralia's  assets  are  very  sound  and  her</span><span>  potentialities  almost  limitless,  which  is</span><span>  true  enough.  Had  the  Commonwealth</span><span>  not  been  such  a  country  politicians  would</span><span>  have  ruined  it  long  ago;  on  the  whole</span><span>  progress  has  been  effected  not  by  them</span><span>  but  in  spite  of  them,  for  the  huge  ex</span><span>  penditures  of  loan  funds  have  rarely</span><span>  built  up  productive  assets.</span><span>  The  fourth  reason  stated  is  that  the</span><span>  Australians  are  a  virile  race,  which  will</span><span>  be  roused  'through  the  depression  to</span><span>  greater  activities  towards  sound  progress'</span><span>  This  certainly  applies  to  the  .vast  ma</span><span>  jority  of  citizens,  but  at  the  moment  the</span><span>  power  lies  in  the  hands  «f  tbe  irre</span></p> <p><span>  sponsible  minority.  Under  the  existing</span><span>  political  system,  it  is  not  possible  for</span><span>  the  majority  to  take  control  of  the  situa</span><span>  tion,  and  therefore  they  arc  compelled</span><span>  to  submit  to  the  damage  which  the</span><span>  accredited  political  heads  are  ignorautly</span><span>  or  ivilfully  inflicting.  Even  if  the  Com</span><span>  monwealth  accepts  the  New  South  Wales</span><span>  responsibilities  temporarily  to  avoid  de</span><span>  fault,  there  must  be  another  crisis  lo</span><span>  follow.</span><span>  Australia's  hopes  of  recovery  are  cen</span><span>  tred  in  electing  leaders  who  will  follow</span><span>  sound,  prosaic  lines  in  government.  Then,</span><span>  among  other  things,  the  avenues  of  as</span><span>  sistance  from  Britain  may  be  opened.</span><span>  The  present  irresponEibles  may  at  last</span><span>  recognise  the  futility  of  their  nostrums,</span><span>  but  the  evidence  is  all  the  other  way</span><span>  and  no  improvement  can  really  be  looked</span><span>  for  until  the  electors  are  able  to  exer</span><span>  cise  their  rights  and  enforce  their  own</span><span>  judgment.

BARNES'  BUDGET.</span></p> <p><span>  Budgeting  Ia6t  year  for  a  deficit  of</span><span>  £723,732,  the  Treasurer  brought  in  one</span><span>  of  £842,044,  and  was  saved  from  pass</span><span>  ing  the  million  mark  by  collecting</span><span>  £389,706  more  land  and  income  tax</span><span>  than  he  had  hoped  to  get.  Encouraged</span></p> <p><span>  by  this  circumstance  he  is  budgeting</span><span>  for  only  £240,000  leBs  from  these</span><span>  sources  than  he  anticipated  last  year,</span><span>  and  many  thousands  of  people  will  join</span><span>  with  him  in  hoping  that  times  will  have</span><span>  so  far  improved  that  he  gets  it.  Even</span><span>  then,  Jie  anticipates  a  deficit  next  year</span><span>  of  £1,871,159,  and  present  indications</span><span>  me  that  unless  the  Loan  Council  makes</span><span>  a  miraculous  recovery  and  attends</span><span>  strictly  to  its  task  of  rehabilitating</span><span>  the  drooping  finances  of  the  nation,  Mr.</span><span>  Barnes  will  prove  a  disastrously  good</span><span>  prophet.</span><span>  While  land  and  income  tax  revenue</span><span>  exceeding  the  estimate  may  be  attribu</span><span>  ted  to  the  addition  of  168  more  officials</span><span>  to  that  unpopular  department,  this</span><span>  assumption  is  offset  by  their  failure  to</span><span>  rake  in  taxation  amounting  to  £761,285</span><span>  that  was  owing  at  June  30th,  1930.</span><span>  Instea/2,  that  amount  had  grown  to</span><span>  £841.182  a  year  later,  so  that  notwith</span><span>  standing  the  growing  army  of  taxation</span><span>  officials  the  chances  are  that  if  Mr.</span><span>  Uanies  can  co^  from  broken,  erst</span><span>  while  taxpayers  the  amount  owing  by</span><span>  t'icni,  he  will  be  able  next  year  to</span><span>  announce  a  surplus.</span><span>  Perhaps  the  outstanding  feature  of</span><span>  tJic  budget  is  the  apparent  fearlessness</span><span>  with  which  the  Treasurer  has  budgeted</span><span>  for  an  expenditure  of  £15,700,744  on  an</span><span>  anticipated  income  of  £13,829,585.  llr.</span><span>  Barnes  may  have  some  suggestions  —</span><span>  other  than  the  hope  of  sighting  a</span><span>  lenevolent  lender  —  for  dealing  with  the</span><span>  deficit  when  he  gets  it,  but  to  date  we</span><span>  have  not  been  favoured  with  Ms  views</span><span>  on  the  subject.

Nor  is</span><span>  it  at  all  clear  that  a  State  facing  the</span><span>  crisis  that  Queensland  now  confronts</span><span>  can  afford  so  sumptuous  un  establish</span><span>  ment  us  that  for  which  the  Treasurer</span><span>  has  Ludjje'icd,  but  not  provided.</span><span>  Commencing  with  the  Premiers  De</span><span>  partment,  there  is  a  reduction  of  seven</span><span>  teen,  there  being  no  increases  under</span><span>  any  of  the  heads.  The  Department  of</span><span>  the  Home  Seerelury  has  an  increase  of</span><span>  Bcvcn'iccu  and  a  decrease  of  ?  twenty</span><span>  seven,  making  the  net  decrease  ten.</span><span>  Of  the  increases  fifteen  are  in  the  in</span><span>  sanity  sub-department,  evidently  a  far</span><span>  sighted  provision  for  the  subjects  to  be</span><span>  supplied  by  Mr.  Barnes'  augmented</span><span>  band  of  tax  collectors.  ThiB  view  is</span><span>  strengthened  by  there  being  tweuly-ono</span><span>  fewer  employees  attached  to  the  charit</span><span>  able  grants  and  institutions.  There  ia</span><span>  little  room  for  charity  for  outsiders  in</span><span>  Mr.  Barnes'  budget.  '  .</span><span>  In  the  Department  of  Public  Works</span><span>  the  decrease  is  only  seventeen,  and</span><span>  considering  how  little  money  is  avail</span><span>  able  for  public  buildings,  the  staff  of</span><span>  181  looks  to  be  overloaded.  The  Labour</span></p> <p><span>  and  Industry  Department  has  forty-five</span><span>  fewer  employees,  but  some  of  these</span><span>  went  to  the  taxation  branch  with  the</span><span>  transfer  of  unemployed  relief.  TbiF  Js</span><span>  the  department  which  makes  it  an</span><span>  offence  to  buy  Queensland-produced</span><span>  goods  for  breakfast,  and  states  the</span><span>  days  on  which  they  may  not  be  pur</span><span>  chased  at  all.  As  the  general  desire  is</span><span>  to  foster  industry  and  not  strangle  it,</span><span>  this  department  might  with  advantage</span><span>  to  the  State  follow  some  of  the  Acts</span><span>  it  administers  into  oblivion.  The  Justice</span><span>  Department  has  a  lessened  retinue  of</span><span>  fifteen,  and  the  Treasurer  sets  an  ex</span><span>  ample  which  he  implores  his  colleagues</span><span>  not  to  follow  by  increasing  his  by  114.</span><span>  The  increase  has  already  been  men</span><span>  tioned  and  explained  —  but  not  justified.</span><span>  Employees  in  the  Lands  Department</span><span>  are  fifteen  fewer,  and  Agriculture  and</span><span>  Stock  has  shortened  sail  by  only  eight.</span><span>  The  hand  with  the  pruning  knife  has</span><span>  treated  both  very  lightly.  In  the  De</span><span>  partment  of  Public  Instruction  the</span><span>  heaviest  of  a  light  pruning  has  taken</span><span>  place,  the  net  decrease  being  24S,</span><span>  against  which  there  are  26B  fewer</span><span>  teachers  for  State  schools.  From  this</span><span>  it  would  appear  as  if  the  axe  used  had</span><span>  a  long  handle,  and  reached  only  those</span><span>  ministering  to  the  needs  of  people  a</span><span>  long  way  from  Brisbane.</span><span>  In  the  Department  of  Railways  the</span><span>  decrease  is  ouly  fifty,  but  as  this  does</span><span>  not  include  the  wages  staff  of  the  Rail</span><span>  way  Commissioner,  the  fall  has  prob</span><span>  ably  been  heavier  am'-  .g  them.  The</span><span>  Main  Eoads  Commission  —  a  subdepart</span><span>  ment  of  the  railways  —  still  carries  a</span><span>  staff  of  220,  a  decrease  of  only  one  on</span><span>  last  year.  In  the  Rockhampton  dis</span><span>  trict  alone  there  are  twenty-two,  with</span><span>  a  salary  bill  of  £7,598,  yet  Mr.  Barnes</span><span>  proposes  to  carry  them  all  on;  and  we</span><span>  only  hope  he  will  find  some  means  o*</span><span>  paying  them  without  money,  as  he</span><span>  admits  being  unable  to  sec  sufficient</span><span>  supplies  of  that  desirable  medium  to</span><span>  pay  all  he  ia  starting  the  year  with.</span><span>  This,  then,  is  the  budget  of  a  State</span><span>  that,  in  common  with  five  others,  is</span><span>  facing  serious  trouble  with  its  bankers</span><span>  before  many  more  months  have  been</span><span>  registered  with  the  months  that  have</span><span>  gone.

"<p><span>  CAIN</span></p> <p><span>  (By  JOHN  MARRISS.)</span></p> <p><span>  He  dared  not  go  back.  For  a  moment  he  hesitated,  then</span><span>  cautiously  towered  himself,  prone,  to  the  damp  grass;  watching  in-</span><span>  tently.  The  stranger  had  come  from  the  thickness  of  the  shrub-</span><span>  bery  hiding  the  house  from  the  road.  Jimmie  Frost  wondered  if</span><span>  he  really  saw  him.  All  he  could  believe  was  that  he  saw  a</span><span>  thickening  of  the  darkness  In  that  direction</span><span>  He  knew  that  he  was  not  mistaken.  Then,  who  was  the  man</span><span>  —for  he  was  certain  that  the  Intruder  was  male?  What  was  his</span><span>  interest  in  that  house?</span></p> <p><span>  JIMMIE  FROST  smiled.  That</span><span>  question  had  brought  another  in</span><span>  its  train.  Who  lived  in  that  house?</span><span>  He  half-turned  and  again  surveyed</span><span>  the  front  of  the  house—  as  if  the  in-</span><span>  sensate  'stone  could  give  him  a  clue.</span><span>  A  shrug,  and  again  he  turned  his  a£«</span><span>  teation  to  that  intriguing  darkness</span><span>  before  the  shrubbery.  The  man  had</span><span>  not  moved.</span><span>  Again  Jimmie  Frost  shrugged.  He</span><span>  could  not  move  while  that  man  was</span><span>  there,  watcliiag.  He  wondered  if  the</span><span>  man  had  caught  sight  of  him.  Was</span><span>  that  the  reason  for  the  stranger's  im-</span><span>  mobility.  How  long  would  he  wait?</span><span>  What  would  he  do,  when  impatience</span><span>  conquered?</span><span>  Suddenly  that  thickness  in  the</span><span>  darkness  disappeared.  The  ex-de-</span><span>  tective  strove  to  find  some  clue—some</span><span>  explanation  of  the  lightning  disappear-</span><span>  ance  of  the  man.  Had  the  man  been</span><span>  frightened  away—or  had  be  known</span><span>  that  he,  Jimmie  Frost,  was  there?</span><span>  Was  he  stalking  through  the  darkness,</span><span>  seeking  to  catch  him,  unawares?</span><span>  Jimmie  Frost  came  to  his  feet,</span><span>  quickly,  searching  the  darkness  with</span><span>  eager  eyes.  Again  he  froze,  glancing</span><span>  anxiously  down  the  drive  towards  the</span><span>  gates.</span><span>  Steps  sounded  on  the  gravel  path.</span><span>  This  time  there  was  no  attempt  at</span><span>  concealment.  The  steps  drew  closer</span><span>  and  with  them  the  slight  scuffle  of  a</span><span>  walking  stick  on  loose  stones.  Warily,</span><span>  he  drew  back  so  that  the  trees</span><span>  sheltered  him.</span><span>  The  man  was  approaching  steadily</span><span>  and  without  the  slightest  attempt  at</span><span>  concealment.  He  passed  within  a  few</span><span>  feet  of  where  Jimmie  Frost  crouch-</span><span>  ed;  and  the  ex-detective  drew  in  his</span><span>  breath  in  a  silent  whistle.  He  knew</span><span>  that  form;  he  knew  that  walk;  the</span><span>  little  trick  with  the  walking  stick—</span><span>  yet  he  could  not  place  a  name  against</span><span>  the  man.  Who  was  he?  Where  had</span><span>  he  seen  him  before—and  that  not  so</span><span>  Iong  ago?</span><span>  The  man  rounded  the  end  of  the</span><span>  drive  and  came  to  the  porch.  Ascend-</span><span>  ing  the  three  steps  he  waited.  The</span><span>  sound  of  the  bell  within  the  house</span><span>  came  clearly  on  the  still  night  air.</span><span>  Jimmie  Frost  leaned  forward,  in</span><span>  terestedly.  Who  was  the  man?</span><span>  Suddenly  the  dim  figure,  standing</span><span>  within  the  porch,  was  illuminated  by</span><span>  a  rush  of  light,  as  the  door  opened.</span><span>  The  ex-detective  sprang  forward</span><span>  with  a  cry  of  amazement.</span><span>  The  man  who  had  entered  the</span><span>  strange  house,  following  Martha</span><span>  Tayne,  was  Sid  Edmund  Morgan,  Com-</span><span>  missioner  for  Police.</span></p> <p><span>  CHAPTER  VIII.</span><span>  JIMMIE  FROST  stared  at  the  clos-</span><span>  ing  door,  in  bewilderment.  He</span><span>  could  hardly  believe  his  eyes.  Sir</span><span>  Edmund  Morgan,  Commissioner  for</span><span>  Police,  had  entered  that  door,  follow-</span><span>  ing  Martha  Tayne!</span><span>  What  did  that  mean?  Had  Sir</span><span>  Edmund  gone  to  that  house  to  meet</span><span>  the  girl?  To  suppose  that  would  be</span><span>  absurd.  Sir  Edmund  lived  in  another</span><span>  suburb  of  the  city,  far  distant.  Had</span><span>  he  wanted  to  interview  the  girl  he</span><span>  would  have  seen  her  in  the  city,  at</span><span>  his  office  or  in  the  jeweller's  shop.</span><span>  No,  Jimmie  Frost  was  certain  that</span><span>  matters  were  not  ""straight""  at  that</span><span>  house.  He  was  certain  that  in  it,  or</span><span>  near,  he  would  pick  up  some  clue  that</span><span>  would  lead  him  to  ""Cain.""</span><span>  For  some  moments  he  stood  hesit-</span><span>  ant,  then  turned,  searching  the  gar-</span><span>  dens  with  his  eyes,  so  far  as  the  deep</span><span>  gloom  would  allow.  He  looked  to-</span></p> <p><span>  wards  where  he  had  hidden  among  the</span><span>  trees,  skirting  the  boundary  wall,  it</span><span>  would  be  absurd  to  go  back  there</span><span>  again.  If  anyone  was  in  the  garden</span><span>  watching,  as  he  believed,  they  must</span><span>  have  seen  him  when  he  advanced  on</span><span>  to  the  gravelled  drive,  to  watch  Sir</span><span>  Edmund  Morgan.</span><span>  Again,  and  now  more  boldly,  he  ad-</span><span>  vanced  into  the  gardens,  crossing  the</span><span>  drive  and  stepping  on  to  the  lawns.</span><span>  He  could  see  no  movements  anywhere.</span><span>  Half-crouching,  he  went  to  the  belt  of</span><span>  shrubbery  where  he  thought  he  had</span><span>  seen  the  dim  figure  of  the  man,</span><span>  searching  it  thoroughly.  He  could</span><span>  see  no  more—he  could  find  no  trace  of</span><span>  anyone  having  been  there.</span><span>  He  glanced  at  the  house-front;  his</span><span>  brows  wrinkled  in  a  puzzled  frown,</span><span>  something  had  happened  there.  For</span><span>  a  moment  he  could  not  understand.</span><span>  He  knew  the  place  bad  altered  since</span><span>  he  had  last  looked  at  it—but  how?</span><span>  Suddenly  realisation  came.</span><span>  Someone  had  been  at  the  latticed</span><span>  windows  immediately  over  the  peak</span><span>  of  the  porch-roof.  Curtains  had  been</span><span>  drawn  across  the  window,  not  so</span><span>  closely  but  that  he  could  see  that  the</span><span>  dimmed  light  had  been  exchanged  for</span><span>  a  stronger  illuminant.</span><span>  Who  was  in  that  room?  Who  had</span><span>  gone  to  the  window  during  the  mo-</span><span>  ments  he  had  been  off  his  guard,</span><span>  watching  the  passing  of  Sir  Edmund</span><span>  into  the  house,  and  searching  the</span><span>  grounds  for  a  possible  Intruder?  Had</span><span>  that  person  seen  him?</span><span>  He  crossed  the  open  space  of  lawns</span><span>  before  the  house,  skirting  the  many</span><span>  flower-beds  and  coming  to  a  gravelled</span><span>  drive;  now  on  the  opposite  side  of</span><span>  the  gardens.  Here  ho  hesitated.</span><span>  What  was  to  be  his  next  move?  A</span><span>  tremendous  urge  possessed  him  to  get</span><span>  into  that  house—there  to  solve  the</span><span>  many  problems  and  questions  crowd-</span><span>  ing  his  brain.</span><span>  His  eyes  came  to  the  peaked-roof</span><span>  porch  over  the  front  door—  and  held.</span></p> <p><span>  If  he  could  gain  that!  The  curtains</span><span>  of  the  lighted  windows  were  not</span><span>  closely  drawn.  He  might  be  able</span><span>  to  catch  a  glimpse  of  the  interior;</span><span>  watch  the  people  gathered  there.  He</span><span>  might  find  a  clue  to  who  owned  the</span><span>  house;  why  Martha  Tayne  and  Sir  Ed-</span><span>  mund  had  come  to  it.</span><span>  A  sudden  gust  of  silent  laughter</span><span>  shook  the  man.  His  memory  had  slip-</span><span>  ped  back  to  a  former  incarnation—</span><span>  when  he  had  been  Mark  Denvers,  de-</span><span>  tective-inspector  of  police.  That  of-</span><span>  ficer  had  traced  many  second-storey</span><span>  men  and  porch-climbers.  He  had</span><span>  claimed  to  know  their  methods—their</span><span>  work.  True,  but  that  knowledge  had</span><span>  been  only  theoretical.  Faced  with</span><span>  the  problem—in  the  guise  of  Jimmie</span><span>  Frost—he  feared  to  act.</span><span>  There  was  a  way  up  that  peaked</span><span>  porch,  to  that  window.  Very  cau-</span><span>  tiously  and  silently  he  went  to  the</span><span>  porch  and  examined  the  structure.</span><span>  A  quick  glance  backwards  and  he</span><span>  started  to  climb.  Soon  he  was  pulling</span><span>  himself  up  the  steep  slope  of  the  roof.</span><span>  His  eyes  came  on  a  level  with  the</span><span>  window-sill.  A  final  effort  and  he</span><span>  was  straddling  the  roof.</span><span>  The  curtains  did  not  quite  cover</span><span>  the  windows.  Rising  to  his  feet  and</span><span>  holding  on  to  the  wall-projections,</span><span>  Jimmie  Frost  shifted  cautiously  until</span><span>  he  found  an  open  space  between  the</span><span>  curtains  through  which  he  could  peer.</span><span>  A  low  exclamation  of  astonishment</span><span>  passed  his  lips.</span><span>  He  was  looking  on  a  well-furnished</span><span>  bedroom.  Someone  was  moving</span><span>  about  the  room—a  woman  in  the  garb</span><span>  of  a  nurse—occasionally  going  to  the</span><span>  bed  and  bending  over  a  still  figure,  re-</span><span>  cumbent  under  the  covers.  Once  the</span><span>  nurse  turned  and  came  directly  to</span><span>  wards  the  windows.  Jimmie  ducked</span><span>  below  the  level  of  the  sill,  nearly  slid-</span></p> <p><span>  ing  from  the  roof  to  the  ground  in  his</span><span>  alarm.</span><span>  For  a  brief  moment  the  nurse  part-</span><span>  ed  the  curtains  and  looked  out  on  the</span><span>  darkened  gardens.  Jimmie  Frost  had</span><span>  the  idea  that  she  was  looking  for</span><span>  someone.  At  length,  she  let  the  cur-</span><span>  tains  fall  back  into  place  and  return-</span><span>  ed  to  the  bedside.</span><span>  For  some  minutes  the  nurse  sat  by</span><span>  the  bed,  passive,  her  hands  folded  in</span><span>  her  lap.  Suddenly,  she  looked  up  and</span><span>  came  to  her  feet,  smiling  at  someone</span><span>  who  had  apparently  just  entered  the</span><span>  room.  A  moment,  and  a  new  figure</span><span>  came  into  sight.  It  was  Martha</span><span>  Tayne.  A  few  yards  from  the  bed</span><span>  the  nurse  met  her  and  they  conversed</span><span>  in  low  tones,  frequently  looking  to-</span><span>  wards  the  figure  on  the  bed.  Present-</span><span>  ly,  Martha  left  the  nurse  and  ap-</span><span>  proached  the  bed.  For  a  moment  she</span><span>  bent  over  the  invalid;  to  straighten</span><span>  with  a  little  frown  on  her  face.</span><span>  Where  was  Sir  Edmund  Morgan?</span><span>  The  counterfeit  crook  looked  at  the</span><span>  face  of  his  luminous  watch.  It  was</span><span>  more  than  20  minutes  since  Sir  Ed-</span><span>  mund  had  entered  the  house;  nearly</span><span>  half-an-hour  since  the  girl  had  passed</span><span>  in.  Where  had  they  been  during</span><span>  that  time?  Were  there  others  in</span><span>  that  silent  house?  Had  Sir  Edmund</span><span>  and  Martha  Tayne  been  in  consulta-</span><span>  tion  during  that  interval?</span><span>  Suddenly  Jimmie  Frost  understood.</span><span>  He  was  Iooking  into  Luther  Banke's</span><span>  bedroom.  The  still  form  on  the  bed</span><span>  was  the  jeweller,  stricken  down  two</span><span>  days  before  in  the  streets  of  the  city.</span><span>  Martha  Tayne  came  out  to  see  him,</span><span>  after  the  day's  work  was  finished.</span><span>  But,  that  did  not  explain  Sir  Ed-</span><span>  mund's  presence  in  the  house.  Had</span><span>  lie  called  to  see  Luther  Banke.  If</span><span>  so,  why  then  was  he  not  in  the  bed-</span><span>  chamber?</span><span>  The  ex-detective  shifted  impatiently</span><span>  on  his  precarious  foothold.  Again</span><span>  he  peered  into  the  room.  Martha</span><span>  Tayne  was  standing  by  the  bed,  look-</span><span>  ing  down  at  the  invalid,  a  frown  of</span></p> <p><span>  perplexity  on  her  face.  Suddenly</span><span>  she  looked  up,  apparently  to  where</span><span>  the  door  stood.  Someone  had  enter-</span><span>  ed,  for  she  smiled  faintly  and  moved</span><span>  to  meet  him.</span><span>  Another  person  came  into  the  nar-</span><span>  row  field  of  vision.  Now  Jimmie</span><span>  Frost  recognised  his  old  Chief,  Sir.</span><span>  Edmund  Morgan.  The  man  exchang-</span><span>  ed  a  few  words  with  the  girl,  then</span><span>  went  to  the  bed  and  bent  over  the</span><span>  still  figure.  Jimmie  saw  that  he  was</span><span>  speaking  to  Luther  Banke.  Ap-</span><span>  parently  the  jeweller  did  not  reply,  for</span><span>  Sir  Edmund  shrugged  and  turned  from</span><span>  the  bed.</span><span>  The  ex-detective  shook  himself,  im-</span><span>  patiently.  He  could  not  understand</span><span>  the  scene  lie  was  witnessing.  Some</span><span>  little  clue  on  which  the  explanation</span><span>  held  was  missing.  If  he  could  find</span><span>  that!  Why  was  Sir  Edmund  in  that</span><span>  house—in  that  room?</span><span>  Sir  Edmund  had  crossed  the  room</span><span>  and  was  now  conversing  with  Martha</span><span>  Tayne.  Occasionally,  he  looked  back</span><span>  towards  the  bed.  Once  his  fingers</span><span>  went  to  his  pocket  and  brought  out  a</span><span>  cigarette  case.  He  took  out  a  cigar-</span><span>  ette,  holding  and  twirling  it  between</span><span>  his  fingers.</span><span>  A  puzzled  frown  came  on  Jimmie</span><span>  Frost's  face.  He  looked  from  the</span><span>  man  to  the  girl.  Something  was</span><span>  wrong.  For  a  moment  he  could  not</span><span>  decide  what.  Then,  like  a  flash  of</span><span>  lightning,  realisation  came.</span><span>  The  man  in  the  room;  the  man  who</span><span>  moved  and  looked  like  Sir  Edmund</span><span>  was  a  counterfeit.  The  truth  stag-</span><span>  gered  the  ex-detective.  But,  he</span><span>  knew  that  he  was  not  mistaken.  In  all</span><span>  the  years  that  he  had  known  his  Chief</span><span>  he  had  not  known  him  to  smoke  a</span><span>  cigarette—he  knew  that  Sir  Edmund</span><span>  did  not  possess  a  cigarette  case!</span></p> <p><span>  Then  who  .  .  .  Almost  before  the</span><span>  question  framed  in  his  mind  Jimmie</span><span>  Frost  knew  the  answer.  The  man  in</span><span>  the  room  with  Martha  Tayne  and  the</span><span>  nurse  was  ""Cain!""</span><span>  He  had  no  doubt,  there  would  be  no</span><span>  doubt.  Now,  as  he  watched,  he  saw</span><span>  other  little  personalities  that  told</span><span>  him  that  he  had  guessed  the  truth.</span><span>  ""Cain""  had  followed  Martha  Tayne  to</span><span>  Luther  Banke's  house;  he  was  in  the</span><span>  house  with  her.  ""Cain""  had  stolen</span><span>  a  fortune  from  Luther  Banke—as  he</span><span>  had  stolen  fortunes  from  four  other</span><span>  men.  And—those  other  men  had</span><span>  died.  Luther  Banke  was  on  a  sick</span><span>  bed;  stricken  almost  to  death!</span><span>  He  must  get  into  that  house  and</span><span>  discover  the  truth—explore  it  and  find</span><span>  out  if  there  were  others  in  the  plot.</span><span>  For  a  moment  he  hesitated.  Then  a</span><span>  wave  of  confidence  came  over  him.</span><span>  He  was  Jimmie  Frost—a  crook  with-</span><span>  out  the  law.  He  could  dare  —  and</span><span>  would!</span><span>  Lowering  himself  from  the  peak  of</span><span>  the  roof  he  found  the  guttering  with</span><span>  his  feet.  A  few  moments  later  he</span><span>  swarmed  down  the  woodwork  of  the</span><span>  porch  to  the  gravelled  drive.  He  turn-</span><span>  ed  to  circle  the  house;  to  find  some</span><span>  way  of  obtaining  entry.</span><span>  A  dark,  mysterious  form  confronted</span><span>  him  as  he  turned.  Instinctively,  he</span><span>  raised  his  hands  to  protect  his  head,</span><span>  but  he  was  too  late.  Something  beat</span><span>  them  down  with  irresistible  force,</span><span>  crashing  down  on  his  head;  blanket</span><span>  ing  his  senses  into  dull  oblivion.</span><span>  Jimmie  Frost,  ones  detective-inspec-</span><span>  tor  Mark  Denvers,  opened  his  eyes,</span><span>  painfully,  and  looked  around  him.  A</span><span>  puzzled  frown  came  on  his  face.  He</span><span>  was  in  a  room  lying  on  a  hard  bed.</span><span>  How  had  he  come  there?  He  re-</span><span>  membered  being  in  the  garden  before</span><span>  the  darkened  house  and  seeing  the  tall</span><span>  dark  figure  menacing  him  as  he  climb-</span><span>  ed  down  from  the  roof  of  the  porch.</span></p> <p><span>  He  remembered  the  stunning  blow</span><span>  that  had  sent  him  into  unconscious-</span><span>  ness.</span><span>  He  remembered  the  garden  and  the</span><span>  house.  Then,  how  had  he  come  in</span><span>  that  room?  He  glanced  about  him.</span><span>  Surely  it  was  a  strange  place.  There</span><span>  was  only  the  bed  on  which  he  lay;  a</span><span>  stool  and  on  the  shelf  on  the  other</span><span>  side  of  the  room,  a  pitcher.</span><span>  He  rolled  over,  uneasily—and  the</span><span>  door  of  the  room  came  into  the  line</span><span>  of  his  vision.  It  was  a  strange</span><span>  door;  heavy  and  substantial  and,  in</span><span>  the  centre  of  it  was  a  little  barred</span><span>  space.  For  some  time  he  tried  to</span><span>  puzzle  the  matter.  What  was  that</span><span>  little  barred  space  in  the  centre  of</span><span>  the  door?</span><span>  A  short  laugh  came  from  his</span><span>  parched  throat.  With  difficulty  he</span><span>  rolled  over  and  sat.  up.  He  wanted  a</span><span>  drink,  but  the  pitcher  of  water  was  on</span><span>  the  other  side  of  the  room.</span><span>  Painfully,  and  with  the  100m  danc-</span><span>  ing  before  his  eyes,  he  gained  his  feet,</span><span>  clinging  to  the  wall.  With  legs  that</span><span>  seemed  unattached  to  his  body  he</span><span>  moved,  circling  the  room  towards  the</span><span>  shelf  and  the  jug  which,  instinctively</span><span>  knew  contained  water.  At  length</span><span>  he  gained  the  shelf  and  seized  the  jug,</span><span>  spilling  most  of  the  contents  over</span><span>  himself  and  the  floor.  At  last  he  got</span><span>  the  edge  of  the  jug  to  his  lips,  gulp-</span><span>  ing  eagerly,  greedily,  at  the  liquid.</span><span>  The  jug  empty,  he  replaced  it  on  the</span><span>  shelf  and  turned  to  face  the  room.</span><span>  Now  a  sense  of  reality  came  to  him.</span><span>  He  had  been  in  rooms  similar  to  this</span><span>  before.  He  was  in  a  police-court</span><span>  cell!  But,  where?</span><span>  A  heavy  step  sounded  in  the  corri-</span><span>  dor  without  the  door,  a  key  fumbIed</span><span>  in  the  lock.  The  door  swung  open,</span><span>  unwillingly,  and  a  uniformed  man  en-</span><span>  tered.</span><span>  ""So  you've  woke  up  at  last?""  The</span><span>  warder  spoke  gruffly,  yet,  not  unkind-</span><span>  ly.  ""Quite  a  bent  this  time,  eh?""</span><span>  ''How  did  l  come  here?""  Jimmie</span></p> <p><span>  Frost  asked,  a  sense  of  impending</span><span>  disaster  sweeping  over  him.</span><span>  ""Brought  in.  Drunk  and  dis-</span><span>  orderly.""  The  warder  grinned.</span><span>  ""You're  a  newey,  ain't  you?  Ain't</span><span>  seen  you  before.""</span><span>  ""Drunk  and  disorderly!""  Jimmie</span><span>  Frost  had  to  restrain  a  grin.  And  he</span><span>  had  been  insensible  since  he  had</span><span>  climbed  down  the  porch.</span><span>  ""Sure,  and  a  real  drunk,  tooi..c.  si(  ,?</span><span>  all  round  the  clock—you  did.  There</span><span>  ain't  a  man  down  the  line  as  ain'</span><span>  envying  you.""</span><span>  ""I  wasn't  drunk—I  was  ill.""  The</span><span>  ex-detective  spoke  without  thought.</span><span>  ""Not  drunk?""  The  grin  on  the</span><span>  man's  face  broadened.  ""Oh  you  all</span><span>  say  that!  Why  you  simply  stank  of</span><span>  th'  booze—even  now.""</span><span>  Almost  as  the  man  spoke  Jimmie</span><span>  became  aware  of  the  the  fact.  He  re-</span><span>  membered  that  the  smell  had  been</span><span>  there  before—but  he  had  thought  that</span><span>  some  previous  occupant  of  the  cell</span><span>  had  left  it  behind  him.  Now  he</span><span>  realised  that  as  he  moved  his  cloth-</span><span>  ing  gave  off  an  aroma,  that  was  not</span><span>  pleasing—of  stale  spirits  or  beer.</span><span>  Quietly,  he  smiled—in  spite  of  the</span><span>  difficulties  he  found  confronting  him.</span><span>  ""Cain""  was  clever!  He  had  climbed</span><span>  down  front  that  porch-roof  to  face  the</span><span>  crook.  ""Cain""  had  slashed  him  over</span><span>  the  head.  When  he  was  insensible</span><span>  he  had  carried  him  to  the  road  and</span><span>  drenched  him  with  spirits—leaving</span><span>  him  there  for  the  patrolling  constable</span><span>  to  find.</span></p> <p><span>  But,  ""Cain""  had  been  in  luther</span><span>  Banke's  bedroom,  talking  to  Martha</span><span>  Tayne,  when  he  had  climbed  down</span><span>  from  the  porch-roof.  Then  who  had</span><span>  been  in  the  garden  watching  him?</span><span>  ""Cain""  had  impersonated  Sir  Ed-</span><span>  mund  Morgan  and  gained  admission</span><span>  to  Luther  Banke's  house.  For  what</span><span>  reason?  Was  Luther  Banke  dead?</span><span>  The  question  trembled  on  his  lips,</span><span>  but  he  dared  not  ask  it.  For  the  mo-</span><span>  ment  he  must  remain  silent.  He  must</span><span>  take  his  medicine.  He  was  a  drunk</span><span>  —a  common,  disorderly  person—lock</span><span>  ed  up  in  a  police  cell.</span><span>  What  a  fiasco!  Jimmie  Frost  re-</span><span>  laxed  back  on  the  hard  bunk  with  a</span><span>  little  sigh.  How  was  he  going  to  get</span><span>  out  of  this  fix?</span><span>  ""Ere!  Come  on!""  The  warder</span><span>  strode  into  the  cell,  catching  Jimmie</span><span>  by  his  collar  and  lugging  him  to  his</span><span>  feet.  ""Get  a  move  on,  can't  yer!</span><span>  Want  to  keep  the  magistrate  waiting</span><span>  all  day,  eh?""</span><span>  But,  Jimmie  Frost,  late  Detective-</span><span>  Inspector  Mark  Denvers,  was  thinking</span><span>  of  the  man  who  had  so  successfully</span><span>  impersonated  Sir  Edmund  Morgan.</span><span>  Commissioner  for  Police—and  won-</span><span>  dering  if  the  newspapers  were  an-</span><span>  nouncing  the  death  of  Luther  Banke.</span><span>  (To  be  Continued.)</span></p> ",Article,1931-09-03,CAIN,70291024,49,49,"{'score': '4138.2627', 'value': 'very relevant'}","He dared not go back, For a moment he hesitated, then cautiously lowered himself, prone, to the damp grass; watching intently.

The  vote</span><span>  ?was  an  open  vote  —  a  secret  ballot  would</span><span>  not  suit  Theodore.  The  voting  was  24</span><span>  tor  and  ID  against.

The  decision  of  the  Court  to  reduce</span><span>  wajies  by  10  per  cent  was  a  fatal  and</span><span>  '/violent  attack  upon  the  workers  which</span><span>  ...  should  be  laid  at  the  door  of  tho</span><span>  I  Na-.ionalists.

The</span><span>  ;  others  arc  vague  and  incoherent  on</span><span>  ,  every  point.</span><span>  t  Here  is  Theodore's  policy  given  in  his</span><span>  1  own  words:</span><span>  ,'  '?'  During  the  war  there  was  deliberate</span><span>  /iwnk  created  inflation  of  nearly</span><span>  *  £300.000.000.  He  was  not  an  advocate</span><span>  '  of  the  simple  expedient  of  printing</span><span>  *  notes  (nothing  simple  about  Theodore).</span><span>  *  'The  issuing  of  notes  was  merely  a  con</span><span>  :'je»|i!onee  of  what  he  advocated.  Every</span><span>  Australian  note  might  support  £6  of</span><span>  liank  credit  according  to  the  ratio  adop</span><span>  ted  by  the  banks  themselves  and  for</span><span>  p  very  *£  of  bank  credit  there  might  be</span><span>  rlierj'ue  transactions  representing  £40  or</span><span>  i50.  That  is  what  is  referred  to  when</span><span>  ?*'?  -we  say  it  is  practicable  for  the  banks</span><span>  t--  increase  purchasing  power.'</span><span>  The  banks  did  create  credit  during</span><span>  the  war.  All  banks  and  every  institu</span><span>  tion  that  had  the  handling  of  money</span><span>  ?during  the  war  did  that  —  'went  the</span></p> <p><span>  limit.'  That  method  was  the  only  way</span><span>  a  country  could  get  money  to  carry  on</span><span>  a  prolonged  struggle.  That  method  did</span><span>  not  pay  for  the  war.  The  war  debt  is</span><span>  still  owing  and  the  interest  on  that</span><span>  war  debt  is  a  millstone  around  the  neck</span><span>  of  industry  to-day.</span><span>  The  Greeks  believed  that  everything</span><span>  that  could  possibly  happen  had  already</span><span>  happened  many  times  before.  Change,</span><span>  therefore,  was  an  illusion  of  time  end</span><span>  place.</span><span>  What  happened  at  the  close  of  the</span><span>  last  war  had  already  happened  at  the</span><span>  close  of  every  other  great  war.  The</span><span>  only  difference  was  that  the  last  war</span><span>  was  of  greater  magnitude,  covered  a</span><span>  large  area,  involved  more  people,  cost</span><span>  more  money  and  consequently  left  in  its</span><span>  wake  a  larger  debt.</span><span>  At  the  close  of  all  other  great  wars</span><span>  the  nations  involved  started  to  work</span><span>  harder,  to  live  harder,  to  practise  strict</span><span>  economy  until  the  burden  of  debt  was</span><span>  considerably  reduced  or  paid  off.</span><span>  The  nations  engaged  in  the  last  war;</span><span>  did  just  the  opposite.  All  started  on!</span><span>  the  jazz.  All  the  nations  involved</span><span>  started  to  work,  shorter  hours,  to  re-j</span><span>  ceive  higher  wages  and  to  run  farther:</span><span>  into  debt.  i</span><span>  We  in  Australia  went  the  limit  on!</span><span>  borrowed  money  and  the  argument  used</span><span>  was  Theodore's  argument  '  to-day  —  if</span><span>  money  could  be  found  to  carry  on  the</span><span>  war  money  could  be  found  to  boom  in</span><span>  dustry,  to  pay  higher  wages,  to  work</span><span>  shorter  hours,  to  have  a  good  time  gene</span><span>  rally  and  then  we  crashed.</span><span>  The  bank  deliberately  created  infla</span></p> <p><span>  tion  during  the  war,  says  Theodore  —</span><span>  they  did.  The  Governments  of  Aus</span><span>  tralia  (including  Theodore's  in  Queens</span><span>  land)  deliberately  caused  inflation  after</span><span>  the  war  by  borrowed  money.  Neither</span><span>  the  war  debt  nor  the  peace  debt  has</span><span>  been  paid;  that  ie  the  cause  of  the  pre</span><span>  sent  depression.  Theodore  now  sug</span><span>  gests  another  dose  of  inflation.</span><span>  Released  credits  don't  pay  debts;  it</span><span>  only  increases  them.  The  war  debts</span><span>  and  the  peace  debts  were  '  released</span><span>  credits  '  ;  they  are  still  released.  If</span><span>  we  were  unable  or  unwilling  to  pay</span><span>  the  interest  on  our  present  debts  when</span><span>  the  prices  of  primary  products  were</span><span>  high  (except  by  borrowing  more  money),</span><span>  how  are  we  going  to  pay  interest  on  an</span><span>  increased  debt  when  the  price  of  our</span><span>  primary  products  are  low  ?</span><span>  The  biggest  chump  in  this  country</span><span>  in  power  could  have  borrowed  money</span><span>  ?and  increased  purchasing  power.  That</span><span>  method  did  not  require  brains;  all  that</span><span>  was  needed  was  hide  and  hide  is  not  a</span><span>  negotiable  asset  just  now.</span><span>  We  tried  Theodore's  policy,  '  bor</span><span>  rowed  money,'  and  crashed.  The  re</span><span>  lease  of  credits  now  proposed  by  Theo</span><span>  dore  is  borrowed  money  with  a  new</span><span>  name.  The  new  name  won't  alter  re</span><span>  sults.  If  the  banks  adopt  Theodore's</span></p> <p><span>  scheme  'it  will  be  necessary,'  says</span><span>  Theodore,  '  to  depend  on  a  Central  Bank</span><span>  and  the  additional  volume  of  business</span><span>  will  necessitate  the  printing  of  more</span><span>  notes.'</span><span>  There  are  three  lions  in  tho  path,  the</span><span>  trading  banks,  the  Commonwealth  Bank,</span><span>  and  the  Senate.  Theodore  and  his  big</span><span>  game  shooters  are  bad  shots.  Every</span><span>  thing  they  have  fired  at  they  missed.  |</span><span>  The  camp  followers  are  beating,  the</span><span>  bushes  and  yelling  like  dingoes  trying</span><span>  to  drive  the  lions  within  the  range  of</span><span>  Theodore  and  his  big  game  shooters.</span><span>  When  they  get  the  lions  within  range</span><span>  the  big  game  shooters  are  more  likely</span><span>  to  shoot  their  followers  than  shoot  the</span><span>  lions.  Anstey  is  just  as  likely  to  shoot</span><span>  Scullin  or  Theodore  as  one  of  the  lions.</span><span>  Theodore  can  release  credits  by  reduc</span><span>  ing  taxation,  getting  rid  of  a  lot  of</span><span>  superfluous  civil  servants,  and  reducing</span><span>  wages  and  salaries  of  the  remainder.</span><span>  Theodore  would  be  better  occupied  in</span><span>  doing  these  things  that  are  practicable</span><span>  than  chasing  economic  and  financial</span><span>  rainbows  whilst  a  hungry  mob  are  cla</span><span>  mouring  for  food.</span><span>  I  have  given  you  Theodore's  policy;</span><span>  let  me  now  give  Scullin's.</span><span>  Here  is  Scullin's  policy:  'If  I  can</span><span>  keep  my  job  by  sticking  to  the  Mel</span><span>  bourne  agreement  I  will  do  it.  If  1  can</span><span>  keep  my  job  by  keeping  Theodore  out</span><span>  of  the  Ministry  I  will  do  it.  If  I  can</span><span>  keep  my  job  by  putting  Theodore  hack</span><span>  in  the  Ministry  I  will  do  it.  If  I  can</span><span>  keep  my  job  after  Tenton  and  Lyons</span><span>  resign  from  the  Ministry  and  Gabb</span><span>  leaves  the  party  I  will  do  it.

Therefore  starting  a  newspaper</span><span>  there  involved  less  risk  than  might  bo</span><span>  thought  at  first  sight.</span><span>  Though  the  gold1  rush  to  Canoona  in</span><span>  1858  was  the  cause  of  Rockliampton</span><span>  springing  from  a  little  hamlet  of  two</span><span>  or  three  buildings  to  a  township  of  a</span><span>  few  hundred  inhabitants  in  a  few  weeks,</span><span>  many  were  quick  to  recognise  the  ad</span><span>  vantages  described,  and  were  prepared</span><span>  to  settle  down  and  make  the  place</span><span>  their  home.  There  were  others  of  the</span><span>  digging  and  nomadic  clasp,  no  doubt,</span><span>  who  only  regarded  the  village  as  their</span><span>  temporary  home.</span><span>  The  usual  way  of  settlement  in  Aus</span><span>  tralia  and  Queensland  was  first  of  all</span><span>  the  explorer  taking  a  cursory  view  of</span><span>  unknown  lands  and  gaining  Boroe  know</span><span>  ledge  of  ite  contour,  watercourses,  and</span><span>  general  capabilities.  The  information</span><span>  thus  secured  urged  on  the  squatters</span><span>  with  their  flocks  aud1  herds,  who  secured</span><span>  such  areas  as  they  desired,  settled</span><span>  down,  aud  jsteadilv  turned  the  wilder</span><span>  ness  into  profitable  and  valuable  pas</span><span>  ture  land  ;  thus  laying  the  foundation</span><span>  of  an  industry  that  survives  through</span><span>  droughts  and  floods,  and  the  many  dis</span><span>  abilities  that  arise.  This  was  the  ex</span><span>  perience  of  the  Central  District  ;  new</span><span>  men  with  their  following  steadily  push</span><span>  ing  further  and  further  out,  leaving</span><span>  more  or  less  permanent  industrial  cen</span><span>  tres  in  their  wake,  most  of  which  were</span><span>  started  by  the  much-derided  'bush</span><span>  pub.'  These  little  hamlets  were  often</span><span>  wide  apart,  but  they  R0°n  assumed  the</span><span>  name  of  townships,  for  the  hotels  wer©</span><span>  followed  by  a  general  store  and  a  black</span><span>  smith's  smithy,  so  that  the  carrier  and</span><span>  traveller  could1  get  help  of  various  kinds</span><span>  in  times  of  need.</span><span>  THE  BUZACOTT  FAMILY.</span><span>  The  Buzacott  family  did  much  for</span><span>  journalism  and  newspapers  in  the  early</span><span>  days  ofj'the  State,  and  their  enterprise</span><span>  ia  that  direction  will  not  easily  be  for</span><span>  gotten.  There  were  four  brothers,  born</span><span>  ia  Devonshire,  ia  tlie  northern  portion</span><span>  of  that  romantic  county,  which  by  its</span><span>  great  voyagers,  and  their  ravaging  of</span><span>  the  Spanish  Main  in  the  days  of  Drake1,</span><span>  Hawkins,  and  Raleigh,  and  memorable</span><span>  episodes  in  assisting  to  demolish  the</span><span>  Spanish  Armada,  has  left  a  nevortobc</span><span>  forgotten  distinction  to  '  that  county.</span><span>  William  Hitchcock,  the  eldest  brother,</span><span>  served  tin  apprenticeship  to  the  print</span><span>  ing  business  in  South  Molt-on,  and  when</span><span>  his  seven  years'  indenture  was  com</span><span>  pleted  in  1852,  at  a  time  the  whole</span><span>  world  was  being  thrilled  by  the  fabul</span><span>  oue  quantities  of  gold  won  ia  New</span><span>  South  Wales  and  Victoria,  he  d'etef</span><span>  mined  to  proceed;  thither  as  speedily  as</span><span>  possible.  His  younger  brother,  Charles</span><span>  Hardie,  insisted  on  going  with  William,</span><span>  and  so  in  1852,  these  two  intrepid  and</span><span>  adventurous  boys  landed  in  Syomey.</span><span>  ?Work  was  plentiful  and  William</span><span>  quickly  secured  employment  at  his</span><span>  trade.  Probably  he  had  a  little  capital,</span><span>  and  it  was  not  long  before  he  started</span><span>  business  on  his  own  account.  This  con</span><span>  sisted  of  a  job  printing  office  in  George</span><span>  street,  to  which  was  subsequently  add</span><span>  ed!  a  weekly  religious  paper,  '  The  Chris</span><span>  tian  Pleader,'  which  wa8  badly  needed</span><span>  in-  those  days.</span><span>  Time  sped  along.  Both  brothers  mar</span><span>  ried  young,  and  Charles  Hardie,  who</span><span>  had  also  acquired  a  knowledge  of  the</span><span>  printing  business,  decided  to  Btretch  out</span><span>  for  himself.  The  New  State  of  Queens</span><span>  land  had  recently  been  formed,  .  and</span><span>  flowing  accounts  of  its  resources  and</span><span>  prospects  were  appearing  daily  in  tho</span><span>  *  Herald'  and  'Empire.'  Hardie  Buza</span><span>  lOtt  took  a  trip  to  Maryborough,  and</span><span>  Aaviag  expressed  his  views  to  some  of</span><span>  the  business  people  was  encouraged  to</span><span>  ?tart  a  weekly  paper.  v  '  ,  .</span><span>  This  w*»  all  young  Buzacott  neeated,</span><span>  and  going  back  to  Sydney  he  soon  got</span><span>  a  plant  together  ond  returned  to  th8</span></p> <p><span>  thriving  little  town  on  tho  Mary  River,</span><span>  where  lie  started  the  '  Maryborough</span><span>  Chronicle  '  in  I860.  At  this  period  Mary</span><span>  borough  was  the  port  for  all  the  Wide</span><span>  Bay  and  Burnett  district,  and  also  had</span><span>  !ino'st  of  tbe  trade,  of  the  steadily  fill</span><span>  ing-up  Dawson  Valley.  The  'Chronicle'</span><span>  was  the  moat  northern  paper  in  Aus</span><span>  tralia,  and  the  people  of  the  town  and</span><span>  district  were  very  pleased  at  its  ap</span><span>  pearaiwc,  tn-l  supported  it  according  to</span><span>  promise.</span><span>  Meanwhile  other  two  young  brothers</span><span>  of  the  Buzacotts,  George  and  Walter,</span><span>  had  followed  their  brothers  to  Aus</span><span>  tralia,  and  had1  temporarily  settled  in</span><span>  Sydney</span><span>  Rockliumptcn  was  making  big  for</span><span>  ward  strides,  and  settlers  down  the</span><span>  Dawson  were  beginning  to  recogniso</span><span>  that  port  as  a  more  suitable  one  .foe</span><span>  them  than  Maryborough.  By  1801  Rock</span><span>  hampton  was  in  possession  of  many  sub</span></p> <p><span>  stantial  buildings,  population  was  in</span><span>  creasing,  and  there  was  apparently  an</span><span>  opening  for  a  paper.  It  is  almost  cer</span><span>  tain  that  Hard'ic  Buzacott  advised  his</span><span>  brother  William  to  that  effect.</span><span>  THE  COMING  OF  '  THE  BULLETIN'.3</span><span>  In  May,  1901,  William  Buzacott  took</span><span>  steamer  to  Kockhainpton  to  see  for  him</span><span>  self  what  prospects  there  were  for</span><span>  starting  a  newspaper  and  general  print</span><span>  dents  knew  Mr.'Buzacoit  and  his  print</span><span>  ing  business  there.  Many  of  the  resi</span><span>  iug  works  in  Sydney,  and  these,  with,</span><span>  other  of  the  leading  business  men  of  tho</span><span>  town,  urged  him  to  go  to  Boekhampton</span><span>  and  start  a  paper,  promising  him  their</span><span>  support.  The  outlook  was  so  /good  that</span><span>  William  Buzacott  at  once  returned  to</span><span>  Sydney,  sold  out  his  business  there,</span><span>  adUed  to  the  plant  he  possessed,  end</span><span>  took  passage  by  the  e-s.  Clarence  (if</span><span>  no  mistake  is  made),  and  in  duo  course</span><span>  landed  in  Rockhampton.</span><span>  The  writer  is  not  quite  certain,  but</span><span>  he  is  under  the  impression  that  William</span><span>  Buzacott  took  with  Mm  lire  brother</span><span>  George  Hitchcock  Buzacott,  William</span><span>  Davis,  Robert  Mitchell  Ross,  and  John</span><span>  Phillips.  At  all  events  they  were  *U</span><span>  there  soon  after  if  they  did  not  accom</span><span>  TMinr  him.</span></p> <p><span>  George  Buzacott  was  directed  to  look</span><span>  after  the  financial  part  of  the  new  busi</span><span>  ness.  He  remained  with  his  brother  for</span><span>  five  or  six  years,  and'  when  the  financial</span><span>  crisis  took  place,  ho  obtained  a  good</span><span>  position  on  tho  clerical  staff  of  the</span><span>  General  Post  Office,  Brisbane,  and  '  in</span><span>  timo  became  Deputy  PostmasterGene</span><span>  ral,  a  position  he  held  with  credit.

Robert  Mitchell  Ross  was  an  appren</span><span>  tice,  nineteen  years  of  age,  when  he</span><span>  came  to  Rockhampton.  Ho  served  his</span><span>  indentures  out,  became  foreman  of  the</span><span>  '  Bulletin,'  and  then  went  to  Brisbane</span><span>  and  Toowoomba.

Mr.</span><span>  Clements  (town  surveyor)  enquired  into</span><span>  the  available  Crown  lands  within  the</span><span>  municipality  and  a  week  later  recom</span><span>  mended  the  recreation  reserve  on  the</span><span>  river  bank  as  the  most  suitable.  '</span><span>  THE  FIRST  TRUSTEES.</span><span>  Up  to  this  point  there  had  been  great</span><span>  unanimity  among  those  desirous  of  es</span><span>  tablishing  a  Grammar  School,  but  on</span><span>  the  question  of  the  site  there  were</span><span>  many  definite  opinions.  At  last  six</span><span>  |  sites  were  seriously  considered  by  tho</span><span>  committee  who  visited  them  all.  On</span><span>  Wednesday..  February  13th,  the  mem</span><span>  bers  went  on  horseback  to  several  of</span><span>  the  proposed  locations  and  among  them</span><span>  the  reserve  which  had  been  set  apart  for</span><span>  Government  House,  which  site  was</span><span>  eventually  selected.  On  September  3rd.</span><span>  d  meeting  of  subscribers  could  not  agree</span><span>  on  the  question,  but  elected  the  first</span><span>  trustees,  who  were  duly  gazetted  on</span><span>  October  4th,  1878.  The  following  com</span><span>  prised  the  first  board:  —  Messrs.  Mac</span><span>  farlane,  Jaeks'on.  Pattison,  Livermore,</span><span>  Risien.  Rev.  A.  Hay  and  Dr.  Callaghan.</span><span>  Mr.  Ma'cfarlane  was  appointed  chair</span><span>  man  and  Mr.  Risien  secretary,  both  po</span><span>  sitions  being  honorary.</span><span>  RANGE  SITE  FAVOURED.</span><span>  At  this  juncture—  on  October  8th,  four</span><span>  days  after  tho  trustees  had  assumed  re</span><span>  sponsibility  —  a  great  Queenslander  comes</span><span>  into  the  story.  Mr,  S.  W.  Griffith,  then</span><span>  Secretary  for  Public  Instruction,  hap</span><span>  pened  to  be  in  Rockhampton  and  natur</span><span>  ally  his  presence  suggested  a  way  out</span><span>  of  the  dilemma  regarding  the  site.  The</span><span>  Minister  was  taken  round  to  the  vari</span><span>  ous  proposed  locations  and  eventually</span><span>  decided  in  favour  of  the  Range  site,</span><span>  whereon  the  school  now  stands.  Those</span><span>  associated  with  the  school  should  al</span><span>  ways  remember  the  important  decision</span><span>  made  by  the  man  who  was  one  of  the</span><span>  framers'  of  the  Commonwealth  Consti</span><span>  tution  and  the  first  Chief  Justice  ot</span><span>  federated  Australia.</span><span>  ERECTION  OF  SCHOOL.</span></p> <p><span>  Meanwhile,  good  progress  had  been</span><span>  made  towards  the  objective  of  £2000—  -</span><span>  the  population  of  Rockhampton  was  then</span><span>  6600  —  and  when  the  site  had  been  de</span><span>  cided  on,  the  outstanding  amount  was</span><span>  soon  obtained.  In  1879  the  trustees,</span><span>  having  received  £4000  from  the  Govern</span><span>  ment,  called  for  competitive  plans  and</span><span>  25  wero  received  and  submitted  to  an</span><span>  adjudicator  suggested  by  the  Govern</span><span>  ment.  Eventually  the  plan  entered  by</span><span>  Mr.  Sidney  Williams,  a  young  architect,</span><span>  then,  practising  in  Rockhampton,  was</span><span>  awarded  the  premium  of  50  guineas  and</span><span>  was  adopted  for  the  building.  Mr.  Sid</span><span>  noy  Williams  afterwards  took  up  en</span><span>  gineering  and  as  the  patentee  and</span><span>  maker  of  'Comet'  pumping  plants  was</span><span>  extremely  successful.  He  now  controls</span><span>  large  works  in  Rockhampton  and  in  Syd</span><span>  ney,  where  he  resides.</span><span>  S»mo  years  ago  Mr.  Williams  stated</span><span>  that  £6000  was  too  small  a  sum  for  the</span><span>  type  of  building  desired,  and  his  chief</span><span>  concern  was  to  provide  the  most  spa</span><span>  cious  structure  possible  for  that  sum.</span><span>  The  first  tender  was  £4580  for  the  bare</span><span>  fabric,  but  in  consequenco  of  additional</span><span>  work  on  tho  foundations,  alterations  on</span><span>  the  elevation  by  the  Government  archi</span></p> <p><span>  ;ei-t,  iin  amended  scheme,  of  drainage,</span><span>  and  various  other  extras,  the  cost  came</span><span>  to  over  £6000,  being  £300  more  than</span><span>  was  available.  Tho  trustees  had  to</span><span>  guarantee  the  £300  and  thus  they  were</span><span>  actually  in  debt,  and  no  provision  had</span><span>  been  made  for  equipment,  furniture,  &c,</span><span>  while,  at  the  same  time,  interior  finish</span><span>  ing,  such  as  plastering,  wood-lining  and</span><span>  painting,  was  cut  down  to  the  mini</span><span>  mum.  For  many  years  the  interior</span><span>  walls  remained  ps  they  were  left  by  the</span><span>  bricklayer.  The  trustees  had  no  money</span><span>  to  spend  on  the  grounds  and  in  the</span><span>  beginuing  there  were  no  fences  nor</span><span>  gates,  no  layout  of  walks,  drives  and</span><span>  approaches,  no  sports  enclosure,  no  ten</span></p> <p><span>  nis  courts,  no  gymnasium,  &c.  An  ad</span><span>  ditional  £1000,  spent  in  the  early  days,</span><span>  would  have  saved  a  long  uphill  struggle.</span><span>  But  the  first  trustees  were  undaunted,</span><span>  and  oven  when  the  building  was  rising</span><span>  they  were  organising  a  bazaar,  held  in</span><span>  1880,  from  which  they  raised  a  sum</span><span>  sufficient  to  provide  desks,  cupboards</span><span>  and  other  school  furniture.  In  t)Te</span><span>  course  of  the  years  many  improvements</span><span>  have  been  made  out  of  revenue,  and  the</span><span>  early  deficiencies  were  gradually  over</span><span>  come.</span><span>  FORMAL  OPENING.</span><span>  On  February  1st,  1881,  the  school  was</span><span>  formally  opened.  Dr.  Hay  had  become  .</span><span>  chairman  of  the  Trust  on  the  death  of  |</span><span>  Mr.  Macfarlano  in  1880,  and  he  presi</span><span>  ded  on  the  opening  day  and  related  the</span></p> <p><span>  steps  that  had  led  up  to  the  establish-  '</span><span>  ment  of  the  school.  Addresses  were  also</span><span>  given  by  Major  Feez,  M.L.A.,  Mr.  Archi</span><span>  bald  Archer,  Rev.  W.  A.  Diggens,  M.A.,'</span><span>  and  Mr.  Wm.  Pattison.  Mr.  Livermore</span><span>  explained  the  financial  position  and  en</span><span>  rolled  the  first  pupils,  27  girls  and  26</span><span>  boys.</span><span>  APPOINTMENT  OF  STAFF.</span><span>  In  response  to  advertisements,  both</span><span>  in  the  Old  Country  and  in  Australia,  a</span><span>  fair  number  of  applications  were  re</span><span>  ceivoi  for  the  three  positions,  that  of</span><span>  headmaster,  second  master,  and  headmis</span><span>  tress.  The  trustees  unanimously  ap</span><span>  pointed  Mr.  John  Wheatcroft,  M.A.,  of</span></p> <p><span>  St.  John's  College,  Cambridge,  as  head</span><span>  master,  Mr.  W.  Jr  Anderson,  M.A.,</span><span>  B.L.L.,  of  Queen's  University,  Ireland,</span><span>  as  second  master,  and  Miss  Ina  Tweedie</span><span>  as  headmistress.  Mr.  Wheatcroft  and</span><span>  Miss  Tweedie  held  ppsitions  in  New</span><span>  South  Wales  and  were  appointed  as  a</span><span>  result  of  an  interview  by  Dr.  Hay.  Miss</span><span>  Tweedie  married  Mr.  Wheatsroft  and</span><span>  was  associated  with  the  school  for  a</span><span>  quarter  of  a  century.  She  now  lives</span><span>  in  retirement  at  Warwick,  Mr.  Wheat</span><span>  croft  having  died  a  few  years  ago.  The.</span><span>  socond  master  later  became  Dr.  Ander</span><span>  son,  and  rose  to  be  head  of  the  Educa</span><span>  tion  Department  of  New  Zealand.</span><span>  I  RESERVED  FOR  BOYS.</span><span>  The  school  was  run  on  coeduca</span><span>  tional  lines  for  four  years  and  at  the</span></p> <p><span>  [end  of  1884  the  trustees  reserved  thti</span><span>  ?school  for  boys.  The  Government  ot</span><span>  the  day  had  refused  to  pay  a  grant  un</span><span>  less  a  separate  building  was  erected  as</span><span>  a  girls'  school,  and  the  effort  to  raise</span><span>  funds  for  this  purpose  was  not  success</span><span>  ful.  It  was  not  until  1892  that  the</span><span>  Girls'  Grammar  School  was  built.</span><span>  THE  SCHOOL  BADGE.</span><span>  ?  In  the  beginning  there  was  great  en</span><span>  thusiasm  and  prizes  were  promised  in</span><span>  plenty.  A  medal  was  to  be  given  to</span><span>  the  head  boy  and  head  girl  of  the</span><span>  school  and  the  deeign  chosen  for  the</span><span>  medal  became  the  school  badge.  Dr.</span><span>  Hay  suggested  the  Southern  Cross  as</span><span>  the  appropriate  emblem  for  the  shield.</span><span>  For  the  crest  Mr.  Bees  R,  Jones  jocu</span><span>  larly  suggested  an  alligator,  and  for</span><span>  the  motto  the  Greek  words,  meaning  'In</span></p> <p><span>  the  river  there  are  crocodiles.'  But  there</span><span>  was  another  geographical  fact  that  pre</span><span>  sented  itself:  the  Tropic  of  Capricorn</span><span>  passes  close  by  Rockhampton.  This  fact</span><span>  is  expressed  by  the  he-goat  surmount</span><span>  ing  the  shield.  There  remained  only</span><span>  the  motto  to  complete  the  heraldic  in</span><span>  signia.  True  education  aims  first  at</span><span>  making  the  man,  and  after  that,</span><span>  the  scholar,  and  as  Dr.  Hay  .writes,</span><span>  the  motto  Macte  virtute  et  litteris</span><span>  (grow  in  manlinesE  and  learning)  covers</span><span>  the  2eld  and  the  method  of  all  true</span><span>  education.  May  the  motto  ever  guide</span><span>  the  efforts  both  of  teachers  and  of</span><span>  pupils.</span></p> <p><span>  it  was  unfortunate  that  permanent</span><span>  prizes,  such  as  the  Lilley  medals  in</span><span>  the  Brisbane  Grammar  Schools,  the</span><span>  Prince  Alfred  prize  in  the  Ipswich</span><span>  Grammar  School,  and  the  Melville  and</span><span>  Travis  bequests  in  the  Maryborough</span><span>  Grammar  Schools  6hould  not  have  been</span><span>  secured  for  Rockhampton  at  a  time</span><span>  when  enthusiasm  for  education  was</span><span>  more  altruistic  than  it  is  to-day.

In</span><span>  poirit  of  fact  it  has  been  a  long  struggle</span><span>  to  build  up  the  Kockhampton  Gramma:</span><span>  School  to  its  present  state-  Durin;:</span><span>  every  period  of  prosperity,  any  small</span><span>  profit  that  was  made  has  been  put  inU</span><span>  improvements,  repairs  and  eo  forth.</span><span>  The  long  tale  of  progress  need  not  be</span><span>  related  in  full.  For  the  first  few  year-=</span><span>  the  school  flourished  exceedingly,  then</span><span>  for  five  years  it  had  to  struggle  for</span><span>  existence.  About  1889  the  numbers  on</span><span>  rolled  unaccountably  increased  and  the</span><span>  forward  march  was  resumed.  In  1890</span><span>  the  gymnasium  wae  built  and  ten  year*</span><span>  later  sufficient  funds  had  been  accumu</span><span>  lated  to  lay  out  the  sports  oval.  Dur</span><span>  ing  all  this  time  the  policy  of  making</span><span>  improvements  out  of  revenue  held  the</span><span>  field.  A  notable  improvement  to  the</span><span>  school  buildings  is  also  ,  chronicled  i'</span><span>  1900,  but  this  was  done  with  lowv</span></p> <p><span>  The  School  in  1927.</span></p> <p><span>  The  War  Memorial.</span></p> <p><span>  The  ioai  Crew  After  Winning.</span></p> <p><span>  inoney.  Balconies  were  built  on  the</span><span>  front  of  the  school  ;  the  class-room*</span><span>  iweie.  renovated.  In  1908  the  chemic.U</span><span>  laboratory  was  built  und  equipped.</span><span>  Still,  the  interest  and  redemption  of</span><span>  loans  was  an  inappreciable  item  in  the</span><span>  accounts-  About  1011  it  \vas  thought</span><span>  that  faster  progress  would  result  if  a,</span><span>  substantial  loan'  were  obtained.  So  the</span><span>  6urn  of  £3000,  afterwards  increased  t'</span><span>  .  £4000,  was  secured  and  -  the  interest</span><span>  and  redemption  charge  jumped  from</span><span>  about  £90  to  over'  £450  per  annum.  At</span><span>  this  time  the  declared  policy  of  tin;</span><span>  Government  was  rot  to  establish  a  high</span><span>  school  in  a  town  wJicre  there  was  a</span><span>  Grammar  School.  .  'TJiere'  waa,  there</span><span>  fore,  a  reasonable  chance'  that  the  in</span><span>  creased  revenue  would  enable  the  lieavy</span><span>  annual  charge  to  b.e  met,  Tho  number</span><span>  in  attendance  did  increase  and  lite</span><span>  school  hag  always  been  able  to  meet</span><span>  its  iinaucte.1  obligations;.-  In  1813  *</span></p> <p><span>  phynea  laboratory  was  ,  opened  by  oir</span><span>  George  Reid,  and  the  special  loan  bor</span><span>  rowed  for  the  provision  of  this  branch</span><span>  of  science  teaching  was  repaid  in  a</span><span>  few  years.  In  l'J20  electric  lighting</span><span>  ivas  installed  out  of  revenue,  and  a  few</span><span>  years  ago,  when  the  City  Council  be</span><span>  came  a  supplier  of  electricity,  the  school</span><span>  was  rewired  and  the  new  system  in</span><span>  stalled,  again  out  of  revenue.  In  192-1</span><span>  teptie  sanitation  and  other  improve</span><span>  ments  eosting  over  £1000,  had  to  bo</span><span>  .accomplished  with  loan  money.  The</span><span>  annual  interest  and  redemption  pay</span><span>  ment  is  now  over  £300,  a  very  heavy</span><span>  burden</span><span>  HEADMASTERS  AND  ASSISTANTS.</span><span>  The  echool  ha*  had  only  three  head'</span><span>  masters—  -Mesm.

Farm</span><span>  ers  here  are  satisfied  that  a  type</span><span>  of  cotton  can  be  secured1  that  will</span><span>  grow  successfully  on  the  coast.  In</span><span>  tense  dissatisfaction  is  felt  at  the</span><span>  attitude  of  Mr.  Wells  and  the  De</span><span>  partment.</span><span>  The  question  of  organising  the  coastal</span><span>  growers  to  deal  with  this  question  was</span><span>  seriously  discussed,  and  definite  action</span><span>  in  this  direction  is  probable  in  the  near</span><span>  future.

As  a  l'esult  it  was  elicited</span><span>  that  the  Board  did  not  oppose  the  Bill,</span><span>  but  only  askeqt  for  a.  slight  amendment</span><span>  to  allow  of  the  use  of  a  very  email  per</span><span>  centage  of  skim  milk  in  the  manufac</span><span>  ture  of  margarine.  Skim  milk  is</span><span>  necessary  to  the  use  of  cotton  seed  oil</span><span>  in  the  manufacture  of  margarine,  which</span><span>  last  year  used  200,000  gallons.  This</span><span>  margarine  in  Australia  is  used  for  pas</span><span>  trycook  purposes  °'ly,  and  even  if  its</span><span>  manufacture  were  prevented  not  a</span><span>  single  extra  pound  of  butter  would  be</span><span>  used  because  butter  is  both  too  expen</span><span>  sive  and  not  suitable  to  the  require</span><span>  ments  of  pastrycooks.  The  meeting  ex</span><span>  pressed1  itself  perfectly  satisfied  that</span><span>  the  action  of  the  Cotton  Board  had  not</span><span>  in  any  way  adversely  affected  the  fairy</span><span>  ing  industry,  and  had  safeguarded'  a</span><span>  valuable  market  to  the  cotton  grower.</span><span>  Information  iB  being  sought  through</span><span>  the  Hon.

We  can  all  increase</span><span>  production,  but  the  problem  is  to  do  it</span><span>  profitably.  The  reason  for  raising  this</span><span>  phase  is'  that  the  Victorian  fertiliser</span></p> <p><span>  companies  have  closed  all  credit  and  are</span><span>  supplying  only  those  farmers  who  can</span><span>  pay  cash.  They  have  the  sum  of</span><span>  £2,000,000  out  and  cannot  get  it  in.</span><span>  Then  because  of  the  low  price  of  butter,</span><span>  the  New  Zealand  farmers  cannot  buy</span><span>  fertilisers  this  year.  A  New  Zealander</span><span>  tells  us  that  over  there  fertiliser  is  car</span><span>  ried  rail  free.  Thus,  after  having  this</span><span>  concession,  lower  costs,  and  a  regular</span><span>  rainfall  they  cannot  afford  fertilisers,</span><span>  how  can  we?  It  would  appear  that</span><span>  fertilising  only  pays  at  a  price.  So</span><span>  does  everything  else.  v</span><span>  'ROLLO  BUNTING':  There  are  a</span><span>  great  many  farmers  and  selectors</span><span>  in  Central  Queensland  who,  if  they</span><span>  could  have  all  the  available  work</span><span>  on  their  lands  carried  out,  would</span><span>  be  relieved  of  many  of  their  financial</span><span>  troubles,  and  besides  bringing  additional</span><span>  wealth  into  the  country  would  be  able</span><span>  to  assist  in  relieving  the  present  unem</span><span>  ployment.  A  dairy  farmer  to  whom  I</span><span>  was  speaking  the  other  day  has  eight</span><span>  acres  of  the  most  fertile  scrub  land</span><span>  in  the  district.  Had  it  been  cleared</span><span>  and  ploughed  in  time  for  tie  present</span><span>  potato  crop  it  would  have  returned  him</span><span>  at  least  £80.  With  the  continual  work</span><span>  on  his  dairy  he  was  unabje  to  clear  Che</span><span>  land  himself,  and  -through  the  low</span><span>  price  of  cream  was  not  in  a  position  to</span><span>  employ  one  of  the  many  swagmen.  who</span><span>  would  have  been  agreeable  to  work</span><span>  for  his  keep  and  a  few  shillings.  There</span><span>  are  many  other  farmers  in  similar  posi</span><span>  tions,  the  majority  of  .whom,  I  fee?</span><span>  certain,  would  be  willing  to  give  their</span><span>  employee  a  fair  percentage  of  the  nett</span><span>  proceeds  of  the,  first  crop.  All  that  is</span><span>  required  is  a  little  financial  assistance,</span><span>  and  in  this  matter  I  think  it  is  the</span><span>  Government's  duty  to  become  interest</span><span>  ed,  especially  when  the  work  is  of  a</span><span>  highly  productive  nature.  In  my  opin</span><span>  ion,  with  an  allowance  of  about  10s.</span><span>  per  week,  the  farmers  could  make  up</span><span>  the  balance  of  the  cost  of  rations,  etc.</span><span>  j  There  is  other  work  such  as  wellsink</span><span>  I  ing,  dam-waking,  fencing,  and  the  clear</span></p> <p><span>  .ing  of  undergrowth  that  would  not  «</span><span>  readily  return  a  profit,  yet  would</span><span>  1  greatly  increase  the  productive  quality</span><span>  of  the  land.,  and  enhance  its  value.  I</span><span>  would  like  to  hear  what  members  of  the</span><span>  Farmers'  Parliament  who  consider  them</span><span>  selves  financial  and  economic  experts</span><span>  think  of  my  idea.</span><span>  'SPES';  In  turning  serious  attention</span><span>  to  pasture  improvement  and  chemical</span><span>  fertilisers,  we  should  not  lose  the  vaaie</span><span>  of  organic  manure  and  its  humus  mat</span><span>  in'  properties.  There  is  too  much  ot</span><span>  this  valuable  line  going  to  waste  ou</span><span>  every  farm,  and  even  if  it  is  not  needed</span><span>  for  garden  or  cultivation  use  it  should</span><span>  be  scattered  over  pasture  to  aid  it.  in</span><span>  the  olden  days  most  farms  had  a  man</span><span>  ure  pit  and  drew  all  their  needs  from  it.</span><span>  Chemical  lines,  easily  obtained,  have</span><span>  made  us  slovenly  relative  to  organic</span><span>  manures.  Keep  up  the  organic  manure</span><span>  to  aid  your  chemical  lines  and  you  will</span><span>  get  the  fullest  benefit  from  both,  as</span><span>  well  as  the  crop  growth.  Instead  of</span><span>  letting  the  yard  manure  be  trampled</span><span>  into  dust  and  become  a  curse  in  dry  and</span><span>  wet  weather,  collect  it  weekly,  as  well</span><span>  as  as  much  from  the  paddocks  and</span><span>  cattle  camps  as  you  can.  The  value  and</span><span>  chemical  content  of  organic  manures</span><span>  vary  according  to  the  age  and  food  oi</span><span>  the'  animals,  but  the  following  is  1</span><span>  rough  idea  of  usual  lines:—  Pig  manure,</span><span>  nitrogen  .48,  phosphoric  acid  .14,  potash</span><span>  .7;  horse,  nitrogen  .55,  phosphoric  acid</span><span>  30,  potash  .4;  fowl,  nitrogen  .56,  phos</span><span>  phoric  acid  .35,  potash  .18.  (Note,  as</span><span>  the  excreta  of  fowls  is  voided  together,</span><span>  and  not  separately  as  in  animals,  the</span><span>  _  ____n4-n  »a  ..niiiA  s\£  n\%  ami  Pa  I  ftnYl  T.  ATI  t</span></p> <p><span>  may  be  doubled,  according  to  the  age  ot</span><span>  the  manure.  Cow  manure  is  similar  to</span><span>  horse  but  less  concentrated  and  would</span><span>  need  nearly  double  the  quantity  to  de</span><span>  tain  the  same  chemical  value.</span><span>  'OLD  !UN':  It  is  now  time  for  |</span><span>  planting  strawberries,  eo  perhaps  a  few</span></p> <p><span>  hints  from  one  who  has  secured  prizes  |</span><span>  at  Clermont  and  Bockhampton,  and  ex</span><span>  hibited  in  Brisbane,  will  be  welcome.</span><span>  The  soil  should  be  an  open  one,  free,</span><span>  from  any  shade  of  trees.  A  strong</span><span>  loam  so.il,  overlying  a  well  drained  aub</span><span>  soil  is  the  most  suitable,  but  the  plants</span><span>  will  grow  on  a  variety  of  soils  except/</span><span>  sandy  ones-  A  good  supply  of  manure</span><span>  should!  be  worked  into  the-  soil  ^some</span><span>  weeks  before  planting.  When  plant</span><span>  ing  spread  the  roots  out  well,  then  press.</span><span>  the  soil  well  down  on  them  to  avoid</span><span>  the  danger  of  the  plahts  sinking  down</span><span>  later.  Give  the  plants  a  good  water</span><span>  ing.  In  my  opinion  the  most  profit</span><span>  able  variety  is  the  Phenomenal.  If  is</span><span>  a  hardy  grown  and  most  prolific,  with</span><span>  nice,  large,  well-flavoured  fruit,  end</span><span>  most  suitable  for  packing  for  the  mar</span><span>  ket.  Like  tomatoes,  however,  there</span><span>  are  many  varieties  to  choose  from.  Af</span><span>  ter  the  plants  have  struck'  give  them</span><span>  a  good  mulching  with  ^hite  pine  shav</span><span>  ings.  They  will  help  to  keep  the  ground</span><span>  moist.  as  well  as  keep  the  fruit  clean.</span><span>  Strawberries  are  liable  to  disease  -such</span><span>  as  blackspot  and  milldew.  I  consider</span><span>  milldew  the  worst,  and  any  plant  ehow</span><span>  ing  that  disease  should  be  destroyed  at</span><span>  once.</span><span>  'A.E.B.':  When  advocating  the  use</span><span>  of  machines,  'Rimau,'  I  was,  of  course,</span><span>  referring  to  large  herds.  The  trouble</span><span>  with  most  of  us  is  that  our  holdings</span><span>  are  too  small  to  enable  us  to  work  up</span><span>  a  herd!  Bufnciently  large  to  enable  «?.  i</span><span>  to  use  machines.  These  small  herds,</span><span>  with  the  necessarily  high  cost  per  head</span><span>  for  equipment,  are  the  chief  cause  pf</span><span>  the  troubles  confronting  dairymen  in</span><span>  the  Rockhampton  district.  Her«  the</span><span>  season  lasts  for  about  five  months  of</span><span>  the  year,  while  from  June  to  Dece*</span><span>  ber  one  is  fortunate  if  one  gets  onc</span><span>  useful  fall  of  rain.  In  .such  a  district</span><span>  it  is,  in  my  opinion,  essential  that  hold</span><span>  ings  Bhould  be  capable  of  carrying  at</span><span>  least  80  milkers.  This  would  enable  the</span></p> <p><span>  dairyman  to  make  five  good  cheques,</span><span>  and  if  the  spring  was  dry  —  an  it  has</span><span>  been  nine  yearB  out  of  eleven  —  he  aould</span><span>  milk  once  a  day  only,  and  thus  keep  his</span><span>  cows,  in  fair  condition  without  having</span><span>  to  hand  feed.  The  man  who  can  hand</span><span>  feed  his  cows  and  show  a  profit,  when</span><span>  factory  pay  drops  below  Is.  3d.  per  lb.</span><span>  must  possess  either  an  extremely  well</span><span>  equipped,  farm,  or  otherwise  have</span><span>  plenty  of  family  labour  available.  'Ri-</span><span>  mau''  considers  that  it  should  be  'quite</span><span>  a  pleasant  '  change'  for  the  wife  to  go</span><span>  out  and  milk,  and  thus  escape  from  tii'</span><span>  drudgery  ot  housework.  Let  him  ask</span><span>  8ome  of  them,  and  he  will  find  that  the</span><span>  vast  majority  resent  having  »to  go  in</span><span>  the  yard.  The'  household  drudgery  re</span><span>  mains  to  be  done  after  she  has  helfeJ</span><span>  in  the  yard;  otherwise,  perhaps,  the</span><span>  heavy  washing  'Rimau'  mentions  could  «</span><span>  be  done  in  the  cool  early  morning,  in</span><span>  stead!  of  milking-  Again,  if  going  out</span><span>  to  help  in  the  yard  i8  a  pleasant  change</span><span>  for  the  wife,  then  going  into  the  house</span><span>  and  helping  the  wife  when  she  is  busy</span><span>  —  which  is  always,  if  there  are  children</span><span>  —should  be  a  pleasant  change  for  hub</span><span>  by;  but  how  many  of  them  even  give</span><span>  the  matter  a  thought?  And  yet.  if  a</span><span>  property  will  not  carry  more  than  about</span><span>  30  milkers,  what  is  the  solution?  That</span><span>  number  is  too  many  for  one  man  to</span><span>  milk,  in  addition  to  doing  the  necessary</span><span>  farm  work,  and  it  is  not  enough  to  en</span><span>  able  him  to  employ  labour.  As  'Herds-</span><span>  man'  once  aptly  put  it,  ''a  man  with</span><span>  a  limited  area  is  like^a  train  without</span><span>  a  line  to  run  on.''  All  new  land,  in</span><span>  my  opinion  should  be  surveyed!  in  at</span><span>  least  1000  acre  blocks  for  scrub,  and  up</span><span>  to  5000  acres  in  forest  country,  accord</span><span>  ing  to  quality  of  soil.</span><span>  'HARVEST  MOON':  This  from  my</span><span>  experience  of  tomato  growing  may  be</span><span>  of  interest  to  'Nightcall'  :  If  the  seeds</span><span>  are  planted  in  rows  of  8  ins.  apart  theY</span><span>  grow  better  than  in  beds.  It  is  weN</span></p> <p><span>  worth  while  to  try  hard  for  healtuy</span><span>  well-grown  plants.  As  I  have  had  as</span><span>  much  as  an  acre  of  young  plants  at  a</span><span>  time  burned  off  with  a  hot  6un  I  I'-ke</span><span>  to  let  the  plants  harden  before  planting</span><span>  out  bv  allowing  them  to  stand  in  dry</span><span>  ground  for  a  few  d'aye.  I  never  care</span><span>  about  the  age  of  the  plant,  but  like</span></p> <p><span>  a  '  plant  about  0  in.  in  height.  Plants</span><span>  that  have  bad  young  tomatoes  and</span><span>  when  they  were  transplanted  have  come</span><span>  on  as  Well  as  any  other.
