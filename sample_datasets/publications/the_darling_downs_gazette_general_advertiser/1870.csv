There  was  nothing  very  jonparlia-</span><span>  mentary  or  strange  in  such  a  proceeding,  and</span><span>  the  only  fault  we  can  discover  is  that  the  revenue</span><span>  has  been  spent  a  little  too  fist  hi  i&$  expensive</span><span>  improvements.</span><span>  The  chums  now  due  on  the  contracts  in  Mar</span><span>  garet  and  Russell-streets  must  be  provided  for  at</span><span>  the  next  monthly  meeting,  and  the  worst  conse-  A</span><span>  cjuence  of  the  decision  arnred  at  on  Wednesday</span><span>  is,  that  the  Finance  Committee  will  be  compelled</span><span>  to  negotiate  a  loan  of  £600  or  £600  at  the  usual</span><span>  rate  of  interest,  when  the  whole  sun*  of  £3000</span><span>  might  have  been  obtained  at  seven  per  cent.  '</span><span>  Then,  again,  there  iaj&  positive  loss  in  the  adver</span><span>  tising  at  Melbourne  Sydney,  and  Brisbane,</span><span>  besides  other  incidentals,  which  will  amount  to</span></p> <p><span>  no  inconsiderable  trifle,  the  whole  being  caused</span><span>  through  the  simple  desire  of  Mr  Qeoom  to  put</span><span>  off  the  business  until  '  somebody  else  is  in  the</span><span>  'CoundL</span><span>  As  regards  the  idea  that  an  entra  rate  flf  six</span><span>  pence  or  one  shilling  in  the  pound  can  be  im</span><span>  posed  by  the  Council,  we  believe  it  to  be</span><span>  altogether  erroneous.  In  the  first  place,  it  ap</span><span>  pears  to  be  inconsistent  with  the  spirit  «f  the</span><span>  Act  By  the  87th  section  of  the  'Municipal</span><span>  Institutions  Act  of  1864  the  Council  is  entitled</span><span>  to  receivefrom  the  Government  one  tfioibty  of  the</span><span>  amount  actually  raised  by  rates  orassesments  on</span><span>  houses  or  land,  so  that  in  the  event  of  an</span><span>  ordinary  rote  of  one  shilling  in  the</span><span>  pound  producing  £1500,  and  the'  special  or</span><span>  liquidation  rate  of  one  shilling  in  the  pound</span><span>  another  £1600,  the  Government  endowment</span><span>  thereon  would  amount  to  £1600,  or  the  total</span><span>  value  of  the  liquidation  rate.  The  Government</span><span>  would  in  fact  oeoome  the  actual  liquidators  of</span><span>  the  loan.  It  is  provided  by  the  64th  section</span><span>  that  no  money  shall  be  borrowed  except  with</span><span>  the  sanction  of  the  Govebnob,  with  the  advice</span><span>  of  the  Executive  CoundL  and  it  is  scarcely  fair</span></p> <p><span>  to  imagine  that  the  Council  aforesaid  would</span><span>  advise  His  Excellency  to  sauction  municipal</span><span>  loans  on  the  terms  we  have  quoted  above.  .</span><span>  Let  us  dive  a  little  deeper  into  the  mysteries</span><span>  of  this  very  remarkable  Act.  The  76th  section</span><span>  directs  that  the  Council  of  each  municipality</span><span>  shall  annually  cause  an  estimate  to  be  made  of</span><span>  the  amount  required  for  the  current  year,  to</span><span>  carry  on  the  making  and  repairing  of  roads,</span><span>  ic,  Ac,  and  any  other  expenses  necessary  in</span><span>  carrying  into  effect  the  provittont  of  the  Ad,  and</span><span>  shall  raise  the  amount  so  estimated  by  an  assess</span><span>  ment,  provided  that  no  such  rate  shall  exceed</span><span>  the  sum  of  one  shilling  in  the  pound.  .  This  is</span><span>  what  is  called  the  general  rate,  because  it  is</span><span>  general  in  its  nature,  exten&og  over  die  whole</span><span>  of  the  Municipality,  and  is  nffpHed  to</span><span>  general  purposes.  The  78th  section  provides</span><span>  for  special  rates  fur  constructing  and  making  any</span><span>  works  relating  to  draining  of  land,  water  supply,</span><span>  sewerage,  and  lighting  ;  such  Bpecial  pates  to  be</span><span>  levied  on  owners  or  occupiers  deriving  any</span><span>  benefit  from  such  works,  and  not  to  exceed  in</span><span>  the  whole  one  shilling  in  the  pound  on  tie  as</span><span>  sessed  annual  value  of  the  property  rated.  An</span><span>  additional  rate  of  sixpence  in  the  ponnd  is  also</span><span>  authorised  for  the  watering  of  streets,  to  be</span><span>  levied  on  occupiers  of  property  in  the  streets</span><span>  watered.'  Under  the  84th  section  it  is  also  pro</span><span>  vided  that  the  Government  may  be  the  lender</span><span>  of  money,  with  the  proviso  that  when  any  money</span><span>  has  been  burrowed  the  Council  shall  assess  and</span><span>  collect-  a  genera!  rate  not  exceeding  sixpence  in  the</span><span>  pound  tor  each  half  year  until  the  debt  shall  have</span><span>  been  thereby  paid.</span><span>  The  natural  inference  therefore  is,  that  the</span><span>  repayment  of  a  loan  and  the  interest  thereon</span><span>  comes  under  the  head  of  ''expenses  necessary</span><span>  '  in  carrying  into  effect  the  provisions  of  the</span><span>  '  Act,'  and  that  in  the  face  of  the  positive  pro</span><span>  visions  to  the  contrary,  no  general  rate  exceed</span><span>  ing  one  shilling  in  the  pound  can  be  levied,  and</span><span>  that  two  general  rates  are  not  contemplated  by</span><span>  the  Act,  notwithstanding  the  proviso  of  the  84th</span><span>  section.</span><span>  So  long  as  the  Council  assess  a  rate  in  accord</span><span>  ance  with  the  76th  section,  and  Colletiit  half</span><span>  yearly,  the  provisions  of  the  84th  section</span><span>  are  also  complied  with,  .  and  no  further</span><span>  or  other  general  rate  can  be  levied  for  any</span><span>  purpose  whatever.  The  object  of  the  proviso  in</span><span>  the  84th  section  is  to  compel  a  Council  that  bas</span><span>  negotiated  a  loan  under  the  auspices/  of  the</span><span>  Government  to  assess  a  rate,  and,  when  assessed,</span><span>  collect  U  ;  otherwise,  there  would  be  iio  security</span><span>  to  the  lender,  as  he  couid  not  niton  w  collect</span><span>  the  rate  if  the  Council  neglected  so  to  do.</span></p> ",Article,1870-12-03,"THE Darling Downs Gazette.

"<p><span>  THE</span><span>  garlhtg1  jjmotts  (§utf\\.</span><span>  TOOWOOMBA,  DECEMBER  10,  1670.</span></p> <p><span>  '  riaio:  jeoo.'</span></p> <p><span>  Notwrbetarddto  the  tact  that  the  prospects</span><span>  of  the  agricultural  community  have  improved  to</span><span>  a  very  great  extent  during  the  past  year,  and</span><span>  although  we  have  every  reason  to  believe  that  an</span><span>  important  and  profitable  industry—  barley  grow</span><span>  ing-  has  been  permanently  established  on  the</span><span>  Darling  Downs,  we  have  still  the  most  absolute</span><span>  proof  that  there  is  little  or  no  demand  for  agri</span><span>  cultural  lands  in  the  district  of  fVavtnn  anil</span></p> <p><span>  Toowoomba.  It  is  true  that  several  selections</span><span>  have  been  made  during  the  last  three  or  four</span><span>  months,  and  the  reports  of  the  business  at  the</span><span>  Crown  Lands  Commissioners  Court  would  lead</span><span>  an  ordinary  observer  to  conclude  that  the  settle</span><span>  ment  of  the  land  was  progressing  with  remark</span><span>  able  rapidity,  and  that  the  time  was  at  hand</span><span>  when  the  dreary  monotony  of  the  western</span><span>  plains  would  be  broken  by  smiling  hamlets,  and</span><span>  peopled  with  a  prosperous  yeomanry.</span><span>  It  is  all  wrong.  We  question  very  much</span><span>  whether  there  is  more  than  two  or  three  selec</span><span>  tions  on  the  list  for  December  that  have  been</span><span>  taken  up  for  the  purposes  of  actual  settlement,</span><span>  and  whether  ninety-nine  acres  out  of  every</span><span>  hundred  have  not  fallen  into  the  hands  of  the</span><span>  'great  monopoly'—  that  monopoly  which  in</span><span>  Queensland  is  represented  by  the  dummy  or  his</span><span>  agent,  and  worked  by  a  system  of  laud-orders</span><span>  which  without'  exception  is  the  most  demoral</span><span>  izing  that  ever  existed  in  connection  with  the</span><span>  puhuc  estate.  It  is  presumed  that  the  orders</span><span>  to  which  ,we  refer  are  '  non-transferable,'  that</span><span>  they  cannot  be  negotiated,  and  that  they  are</span><span>  not  worth  a  cent  in  the  market.  The  dealer  in</span><span>  (bis  kind  of  stock  is  therefore  enabled  to  operate</span><span>  with  owners  or  sellers  on  very  encouraging</span><span>  terms.  The  risks  are  apparent  andieavy,  but</span><span>  the  profits  are  good  in  proportion,  and  after</span><span>  all  the  probabilities  of  detection  are  very  remote</span><span>  indeed.  The  truth  of  this  position  may  be</span><span>  gathered  from  the  fact  that  the  business  has</span><span>  been  made  the  subject  of  public  advertisement,</span><span>  and  that  the  '  highest  prices  have  been  openly</span><span>  paid  in  the  markets  of  the  colony,  notwithstand</span><span>  ing  the  order  of  Arthur  Maoalistee,  late</span><span>  Minister  for  Lands,  to  the  contrary.  The</span><span>  result  of  all  this  is  that  the  greater  portion</span><span>  of  the  'resumed  country'  is  falling,  and  that</span><span>  very  rapidly,  into  the  hands  of  the  speculative</span><span>  capitalist.  The  beautiful  lands  of  Yandilla,</span><span>  East  Prairie,  and  Felton,  are  going  at  the  rate  of</span><span>  twenty  or  thirty  thousand  acres  *  month,  but</span><span>  the  real  bona  tide  settler—  the  man  of  fustian</span><span>  spoken  of  by  Mr  Geoom—  is  seldom,  if  ever,  a</span><span>  purchaser.  We  have  endeavored,  and  that  very</span><span>  oiteu,  to  account  for  his  absence;  we  have  thought</span><span>  that  the  lots  were  too  large  or  too  distant  from,</span><span>  town,  and  that  he  would  prefer  a  selection  from</span><span>  someof  the  lands  so  frequently  offered  by  auction.</span><span>  What  do  we  find  »  On  Tuesday  last  fifty-five</span><span>  lots  of  agricultural  land  were  offered  for  sale  at</span><span>  the  Land  Office  in  Russell-street,  and  thir</span><span>  teen  alone  of  them  were  taken,  and  by  whom</span><span>  —Mr  John  Watts  !

Wat</span><span>  son,  at  the  upset  price  of  £l  per  acre.  On  the</span><span>  following  day  twenty-six  thousand  acres  of  first</span><span>  class  pastoral  land  were  taken  up  under  the</span><span>  forty-fourth  section  of  the  Crown  Lands  Aliena</span><span>  tion  Act  of  1866,  and  on  Thursday  one  hundred</span><span>  and  eleven  homesteads,  consisting  of  land  in  the</span><span>  parishes  of  Qehatn,  Tooth,  and  King,  were  offered</span><span>  )y  auction  at  the  general  rate  of  fifteen  shillings</span><span>  per  acre  ;  one  hundred  and  ten  lots  were  passed</span><span>  without  an  offer,  and  the  only  purchase  of  the</span><span>  day  was  one  made  by  Mr  Davbnpoet,  which</span><span>  consisted  of  three  hundred  and  twenty  acreH  in</span><span>  the  Parish  of  Tooth,  near  the  Warwick  railway</span><span>  line.</span><span>  We  have  repeatedly  referred  to  the  injustice</span><span>  of  forcing  these  rich  agricultural  areas  into  the</span><span>  market,  without  any  consideration  as  to  the</span><span>  iiture  necessities  of  the  colony,  but  we  have</span><span>  been  met  with  the  assurance  that  'the  law</span><span>  allows  it,'  and  we  must  be  content  to  sit  down</span><span>  and  watch  the  '  pick  of  tbe  country'  passing</span><span>  away  into  the  hands  of  a  few  princely  owners</span><span>  without  the  slightest  hope  of  redemption.</span><span>  When  the  horse  is  gone  we  shall  get  up  and</span><span>  fasten  the  door.</span></p> ",Article,1870-12-10,"THE Darling Downs Gazette.

An  additional  opportunity,  however,</span><span>  will  be  available  this  month  by  the  new  line  of  mail</span><span>  steamers  via  Auckland  and  San  Francisco,  the</span><span>  second  monthly  steamer  of  this  service  being  adver</span><span>  tised  to  leave  Sydney  on  the  26th  instant.</span><span>  The  political  events  of  the  month  have  been  more</span><span>  than  usually  stirring,  inasmuch  as  we  have  had  a</span><span>  change  in  the  Ministry,  and  the  Hon.  Arthur  H.</span><span>  Palmer  has  accepted  the  position  and  responsibility</span><span>  of  Premier  in  the  place  of  Mr  C.  Lilley.  The</span><span>  circumstances  attending  the  resignation  were  peculiarly</span><span>  strange,  and  strongly  indicative  of  failing  confidence.</span><span>  The  OpeningSpecch  abounded  in  promises,  and  dealt</span><span>  very  fairly  with  those  vital  questions  of  progress</span><span>  and  reform  which  have  been  shelved  or  timidly</span><span>  handled  by  every  previous  Ministry.  The  Opposition</span><span>  tappeared  in  great  force,  refused  to  accept  the</span><span>  pledges  of  the  Premier,  and  when  the  final  division</span><span>  was  taken  on  the  question  of  confidence  one  member  I</span><span>  ouly  appeared  in  support  of  the  Government.  The</span><span>  principal  charges  preferred  against  the  Ministry</span><span>  were—  the  social  failings  of  the  Premier,  the</span><span>  dishonest  distribution  of  the  public  estate,  and  the</span><span>  unwarranted  outlay  of  several  thousand  pounds  upon</span><span>  a  mail  steamer  at  a  time  when  the  interests  of  the</span><span>  colony  demanded  a  stern  and  stubborn  opposition</span><span>  to  the  attempted  monopolies  of  a  wealthy  steamship</span><span>  proprietarv  established  in  Sydney.  The  Premier,</span></p> <p><span>  seeing  the  strength  of  his  opposers,  declined  to  offer</span><span>  any  defence,  and  the  other  members  of  the  Cabinet</span><span>  followed  the  example  of  their  leader  ;  so  that  Mr</span><span>  Bell's  amendment  to  the  address  in  reply,</span><span>  (equivalent  to  a  vote  of  want  of  confidence,)  was  bustled</span><span>  through  the  house  in  about  a  couple  of  hours,  and</span><span>  ultimately  carried  by  a  majority  of  seventeen  to  six.</span><span>  On  the  following  day  Mr  Lilley  tendered  his</span><span>  resignation  to  the  Governor,  and  Mr  Bell  was  invited  to</span><span>  form  a  Government.  A  slight  consideration</span><span>  convinced  that  gentleman  of  the  weakness  of  his  'fol-</span><span>  lowing;'  but,  having  reduced  the  pliant  Minister</span><span>  for  Works  (Mr  Macalister)  from  his  allegiance,  he</span><span>  ultimately  determined  upon  submitting  the  following</span><span>  names  to  His  Excellency  on  the  morning  of  the  29th</span><span>  April  :  —  Mr  Macalister,  Premier  and  Minister  for</span><span>  Works  ;  Mr  Bell,  Colonial  Secretary  ;  Mr  Atkiu,</span><span>  Colonial  Treasurer  j  Mr  T  ring,  Attorney-General  ;</span><span>  Mr  Miles,  Minister  for  Lands  ;  and  Mr  Gore,  Post</span><span>  master-General.  During  the  night  of  the  28th,</span><span>  however,  Mr  Macalister  became  alive  to  the  enormity</span><span>  of  his  secession,  and  early  on  Friday  morning  he</span><span>  advised  his  colleagues  that  he  was  unable  to  continue</span><span>  in  office.  Mr  Bell,  taking  this  ominous  defection</span><span>  into  consideration,  abandoned  the  hope  of</span><span>  success  in  his  new  profession  of  Cabinet-making,  and</span><span>  finally  advised  His  Excellency  to  send  for  the  member</span><span>  for  Port  Curtis  (Mr  Palmer),  who,  after  a  few</span><span>  days'  consideration,  announced  the  following  new</span><span>  Ministry  :  —  Mr  Palmer,  Premier  and  Colonial  Secretary</span></p> <p><span>  ;  Mr  Ramsay,  Colonial  Treasurer  ;  Mr  Walsh,</span><span>  Minister  for  Works  ;  Mr  J.  M.  Thompson,  Minister</span><span>  for  Lands  ;  Mr  Bramston,  Attorney-General  ;  and</span><span>  Mr  Prior,  Postmaster-General.  A  Government</span><span>  Gazette  Extraordinary  was  issued  on  Thursday</span><span>  May  8th,  containing  a  proclamation  by</span><span>  His  Excellency  proroguing  Parliament  until  the</span><span>  28th  June,  and  the  third  session  of  the  fourth</span><span>  Parliament  of  Queensland  is  therefore  at  a  close.  It</span><span>  is  thought  that  the  whole  of  the  vacancies  in  the</span><span>  Legislative  Assembly  cannot  be  provided  until  the</span><span>  middle  of  Juiy,  and  consequently  there  is  every</span><span>  probability  of  a  further  delay  in  the  '  despatch  of</span><span>  business,'  Owing  to  the  absence  of  Messrs  Bright,</span><span>  Sandeman,  and  Milford  during  the  past  session  their</span><span>  respective  seats  have  become  vacant,  and  a  re-election</span><span>  will  be  necessary  for  each  electorate.  There  is</span><span>  every  probability  that  the  members  of  the  Ministry</span><span>  will  be  returned  without  opposition,  as  a  general</span><span>  anxiety  has  been  evinced  for  the  resumption  of</span><span>  business.  The  Government  may  be  considered  a</span><span>  strong  one  when  the  present  state  of  the  House  is  '</span><span>  taken  into  consideration,  and  we  have  every  reason</span><span>  to  believe  they  will  be  permitted  to  enjoy  the</span><span>  administration  of  public  affairs  until  the  promised</span><span>  scheme  of  electoral  reform  has  been  carried  through</span><span>  the  House,  and  the  number  of  its  representative</span><span>  members  largely  increased,</span><span>  SOCIAL  AND  GENERAL.</span><span>  During  the  past  month  we  have  experienced  a</span><span>  few  days  of  rough  wintry  weather  ;  but,  very  for</span><span>  tunately,  we  have  entirely  escaped  those  heavy</span><span>  floods  which,  for  the  second  time  (luring  the  present</span><span>  season,  hare  visited  the  low-lying  districts  of  New</span><span>  South  Wales.

The  children  met  at</span><span>  I  St  Luke's  School-room  at  2  o'clock,  and  being  mar</span><span>  1  shalled  into  procession  by  the  Rev.  Incumbent  and</span><span>  I  the  lady  teachers,  they  marched  through  the  town</span><span>  ;  to  St.  James'  Church  headed  by  the  German  band,</span><span>  [and  presented  a  very  gay  appearance  with  their</span><span>  i  dainty  little  Hags  and  more  assuming  banners.  Ou</span><span>  1  returning  to  St.  Luke's,  the  teachers  indulged  the</span><span>  1  children  with  a  variety  of  games,  and  shortly  after</span><span>  wards  an  abundant  feast  of  cake  and  tea  was  served</span><span>  to  the  multitude  by  a  host  of  lady  assistants.  The</span><span>  children  appeared  to  enter  into  the  Bpirit  of  the</span><span>  movement  with  refreshing  effect,  and  after  a  brief</span><span>  interval  of  rest  and  a  little  more  fun,  they  departed</span><span>  to  their  homes  highly  delighted  with  the  day's  fes</span><span>  tivity.</span><span>  There  was  a  large  attendance  at  the  Police  Office</span><span>  on  Thursday,  April  28,  in  anticipation  of  a  public</span><span>  examination  of  the  prisoner  Herrlich,  who  stands</span><span>  charged  with  the  wilful  murder  of  Michael  Kiien,</span><span>  at  the  Cellar  Scrub,  near  Perseverance  station,  on</span><span>  the  )2th  February  last.  The  principal  witnesses  iu</span><span>  the  case—  namely,  the  boy  Eppla,  who  was  present</span><span>  at  the  murder,  and  the  brother  of  the  deceased  man</span><span>  —  v/ere  overtaken  hv  the  police  at  Bendemere,  on</span><span>  the  20th  ultimo,  and  attended  to  give  evidence.  The</span><span>  inquiry  was  conducted  in  one  of  the  cells  of  the  gaol</span><span>  as  it  was  deemed  inexpedient  to  remove  the</span><span>  prisoner  in  his  present  exhausted  condition.</span><span>  He  frequently  complained  of  the  chilly  at</span><span>  mosphere,  aud  asked  tor  additional  blankets,  which  |</span><span>  were  readily  supplied,  but  his  weakness  appeared  to</span><span>  be  of  such  an  extreme  character  that  he  was  utterly</span><span>  unaWe  to  arrange  them  without  the  assistance  of  the</span><span>  police.  Mr  Harris  conducted  the  case  for  the</span><span>  Crown,  and  in  answer  to  a  question  from  the  Police</span><span>  Magistrate  the  prisoner  said  he  had  nothing  to  say</span><span>  on  the  present  occasion,  but  he  wished  to  be  heard</span></p> <p><span>  in  court  as  early  as  possible,  as  he  might  not  survive</span><span>  I  many  days.  The  whole  of  the  evidence  taken  in  the</span><span>  ,  examination  was  read  over  to  the  prisoner,  and  he</span><span>  i  was  then  fully  committed  for  trial  at  the  assizes  to</span><span>  be  holden  at  Toowoomba  on  the  25tii  July  next.</span><span>  A  young  borse-stealer  named  John  Ware,  about</span><span>  12  years  old,  was  arrested  at  Dalby  on  Tuesday,  May</span><span>  10,  on  the  charge  of  stealing  a  horse,  the  property</span><span>  of  Mr  W.  Hutcheson,  of  Toowoomba.  It  appears</span><span>  that  the  young  vagabond  had  been  in  the  employ</span><span>  ment  of  Mr  Hutcheson  for  about  twelve  mouths,</span><span>  and  having  obtained  a  new  'rig  out'  on  Saturday,</span><span>  7th,  he  appeared  to  make  up  his  mind  to  seek  a  new</span><span>  master.  On  the  following  morning  the  Dalby  police</span><span>  were  apprised  of  the  circumstances  of  the  case,  and</span><span>  succeeded  in  capturing  the  truant  immediately  after</span><span>  his  arrival  in  the  township.</span><span>  We  regret  to  leara  from  the  Courier  that  a  serious</span><span>  accident  happened  to  Sir  Maurice  O'Connell  on</span><span>  the  evening  of  Thursday,  May  5,  wliile  on  his</span><span>  way  to  Rosemount,  his  residence,  on  the  Bowen</span><span>  Bridge-road.  It  seems  that  the  hon.  gentleman  was</span><span>  riding  down  the  hill  opposite  the  hospital  grounds</span><span>  at  a  canter,  when  his  horse  stumbled  and  fell,  the</span><span>  rider  being  thrown  to  the  ground  with  considerable</span><span>  violence,  and  tbe  animal  falling  on  him.  Fortu</span><span>  nately,  Lady  O'Connell,  accompanied  by  another</span><span>  lady,  was  immediately  behind  in  a  carriage,  and  he</span><span>  was  lifted  up,  placed  therein,  and  conveyed  home.</span><span>  It  was  ascertained  that,  though  no  bones  were</span><span>  broken,  the  left  hip  had  sustained  some  injury,  acd</span><span>  he  was  bruised  in  various  parts  of  his  body,  and</span><span>  severely  shaken.  Sir  Maurice  is  still  confined  to</span><span>  his  room,  and  the  injuries  have  proved  to  be  more</span><span>  serious  than  was  at  first  anticipated.</span><span>  Another  Brisbane  paper  states  that  an  im</span><span>  mense  sword-fish  was  caught  in  the  Bay  a  few  days</span><span>  ago,  by  the  crew  of  a  boat  belonging  to  Mr  Win</span><span>  stone,  the  fishmonger,  of  Edward-street.  The  body</span><span>  alone  measured  twenty-two  feet,  and  the  sword</span><span>  armed  with  teeth  from  the  snout,  measured  four  feet</span><span>  six  inches.  A  portion  of  the  head  with  the  sword</span><span>  attached  has  been  preserved,  and  can  be  seen  at</span><span>  Mr  Winatone's  shop.</span><span>  Befebrino  to  the  value  of  horses  in  the  Dalby</span><span>  market,  the  local  journal  of  April  30  says  :—  At  a</span><span>  pound  sale  held  the  other  day,  a  line  looking  mare,</span><span>  in  good  condition,  was  knocked  down  for  ninepence  ]</span><span>  She  had  a  bumble  foot,  to  be  sure,  but  would  make</span><span>  a  good  brood  mare  for  all  that.

It  appears  that  on  the  night  she  wan  found</span><span>  dead  in  her  room,  he  went  home  drunk  and  beat  her</span><span>  to  death  with  a  thick  stick.  The  medical  evidence</span><span>  tends  to  the  conclusion  that  death  was  not  caused</span><span>  by  any  particular  blow,  but  by  the  general  shock  to</span><span>  the  nervous  system.  The  prisoner  made  no  conceal</span><span>  ment  of  flie  circumstances  resulting  in  the  death  of</span><span>  tine  poor  woman,  and,  when  asked  by  the  Bench  if</span><span>  he  had  anything  to  say,  he  became  very  much  agi</span><span>  tated,  could  not  speak,  and  fell  back  in  the  dock.</span><span>  His  wife  was  a  very  intemperate  woman.</span><span>  A  CORRESPOMNDENT  of  the  Express  states  that  Job</span><span>  Short,  who  was  undergoing  a  sentence  of  ten  years'</span><span>  imprisonment  for  horse  stealing,  died  a  few  days  ago</span><span>  in  Brisbane  Gaol.  Short,  at  the  time  of  his  convic-</span><span>  tion,  was  reported  to  be  shamming  insanity,  and</span><span>  this  view  of  the  case  was  so  far  taken  up  by  Dr.</span><span>  Hobbs  that  he  ordered  a  certain  coarse  of  treatment</span><span>  that  was  calculated  to  bring  the  man  to  his  senses.</span><span>  The  end  of  it  aO  is  (say*  the  correspondent  of  the</span><span>  flepnJMjthat  'he  has  either  shammed  hjfcwif  to</span><span>  deattw  else  the  treatment  a  real  lunatic  was  sub</span><span>  feeM  to  brought  about  that  event;'  and  with  a</span><span>  view  to  arrive  at  a  satisfactory  ooodoaon,  he  de</span><span>  manfr  a  farther  inqiiiry  at  the  hands  of  tWafftho</span><span>  rfttes.</span><span>  Air  oppurtanity  was  afforded  as  fMarybonmffh</span><span>  Cfcry*fcK)laitweekof  Usting  a  piece  of  tbTneat</span><span>  et  ftedaVottg,  ens*  by  «a»Sng  and  smoking,  and</span><span>  sent  KpGmn  the  fishery  prosecuted  at  Wide  Bay</span></p> <p><span>  through  the  enterprise  of  Mr  Ehflneter  Thome,  a</span><span>  resident  of  this  town.  In  appearance  this  meat</span><span>  ,  bears  a  resemblance  to,  and  in  Savor  it  equals,  good</span><span>  '  English  ham.  The  aborigines,  many  of  whom  are</span><span>  ,  employed  in  harpooning  the  risb,  are,  we  understand,</span><span>  extiumely  fond  of  it,  and  consume  immense</span><span>  quantities  when  allowed,  eating  besides,  the  skin,</span><span>  |  which  varies  from  one-third  of  an  inch  to  an  inch</span><span>  iu  thickness,  and  can  be  reduced  to  a  very  nutri</span><span>  tious  and  delicate  jelly.  The  oil,  of  which  we  were</span><span>  shown  a  sample,  in  its  unrefined  state,  has  the  ap</span><span>  pearance  of  a  rich  cream,  and  tastes  like  lard.  It</span><span>  is  very  palatable  on  toasted  bread  or  flour  cokes,</span><span>  and  might  be  UBed  in  this  agreeable  form  by  persons</span><span>  requiring  it  for  medicinal  purposes.</span><span>  Some  short  time  since,  says  the  Korthcrn  Arg»»,</span><span>  a  person  of  the  name  of  Blood  worth  arrived  in  Rock</span><span>  iiampton  with  a  mob  of  70  horses,  dray,  ic,  for  the</span><span>  purpose  of  selling  them  ;  he  accordingly  placed  30</span><span>  head  in  the  hands  of  Mr.  Wormald,  who  sold  them</span><span>  under  the  hammer.  Up  to  the  time  of  tlie  sale</span><span>  riloodworth  was  stopping  at  Mr  Ward's  Commercial</span><span>  Hotel,  aud  was,  we  are  informed,  leading  a  very</span><span>  quiet  life,  but  after  the  sale  he  removed  to  the  Lion</span><span>  Creek  Hotel,  where  his  remaining  40  horses  were</span><span>  iKulilocked.  It  appears  that  since  he  left  tlie  town</span><span>  le  has  been  incessantly  drinking,  ami  between  1-  and</span><span>  1  o'clock  on  Saturday,  April  30,  be  died,  no  medical</span><span>  gentleman  being  in  attendance.  We  understand  that</span><span>  Blimd  worth  sold  his  40  horses—  the  pick  of  the  mob</span><span>  —  for  i'l  per  head  ;  at  auy  rate,  neither  they  nor  the</span><span>  dray  arc  to  be  found,  aud  not  one  single  jiunny  was</span><span>  discovered  on  the  person  of  the  unfortunate  man.</span><span>  The  circumstances  altogether  are  so  peculiar  that  the  '</span><span>  police,  attended  by  Dr.  Salmoud,  health  officer,  went  '</span><span>  out  yesterday  morning  to  Lion  Creek  Hotel.  There</span><span>  will,  no  doubt,  be  a  magisterial  iuquiry  held  this  :</span><span>  morning;  therefore  we  withhold  from  publishing  the</span><span>  very  many  rc]Mirts  which  were  pervalent  in  town  :</span><span>  yesterday.  Mr.  Blood  worth  was  very  respectably</span><span>  connected,  and  nearly  related  to  Mr.  ijee,  the  well</span><span>  known  breeder,  of  Bathurst.  This  matter  must  be</span><span>  sifted  thonmghlj',  as  it  is  surrounded  by  circuni</span><span>  stmices  which  are,  to  say  the  least,  suspicious.</span><span>  The  Muri/liorout/h  Chronicle  reports  a  painful  acci</span><span>  dent  which  to:  ik  place  on  Saturday,  May  7.  A  man</span><span>  named  Kiehard  Mills,  employed  at  Messrs.  ftamsny's</span><span>  sugar  factory,  having  received  his  weekly  pay,</span><span>  crossed  over  in  a  small  flat-bottomed  boat  to  Mar</span><span>  tihidl'e  Slaty  River  Hotel,  where  he  Jiwl  some  re</span><span>  freshment,  and  thence  proceeded  home  by  water.</span><span>  «)n  ueuring  bis  cottage,  seeing  his  wife  waiting  for</span><span>  him  on  the  bank,  lie  threw  her  the  painter  mpe,  to</span><span>  make  the  boat  fast,  and  in  so  doing  over-balanced</span><span>  himself  and  fell  into  the  water.  Mrs.  Mills  unfor</span><span>  tunately  missed  the  rope  and  was  thus  unable  to</span><span>  secure  the  boat  and  assist  her  husband,  who  was</span><span>  speedily  drawn  into  the  centre  of  the  stream  by  the</span><span>  force  of  the  current,  and  when  last  seen  had  been</span><span>  carried  down  fully  twenty  yards,  and  was  exhaust</span><span>  ing  liis  strength  in  ineffectual  struggles  to  reach  the</span><span>  shore.</span><span>  The  following  daring  case  of  horse-stealing  is  re</span></p> <p><span>  ported  by  the  Peak  Downs  Tdnjram  .'—On  Monday</span><span>  April  25,  Mr  Harden,  J.P.,  of  Lanpton  Downs,  bung</span><span>  his  horse  at  the  Prince  of  Wales  Hotel  for  a  short</span><span>  time,  and  had  not  long  quitted  the  place  before  a</span><span>  person  styling  himself  '  Hell-fire  Jack'  coolly</span><span>  walked  up  to  one  of  the  bystanders,  stating  it  would</span><span>  be  a  'lark'  to  take  that  horse,  pointing  to  that  of</span><span>  Mr  Harden,  he  mounted  and  rode  off  towards  the</span><span>  cemetery  ;  ere  leaving  he  told  the  person  to  whom</span><span>  he  had  made  the  above  remarks  that  it  would  be  as</span><span>  well  to  inform  the  J.P.  that  '  Hell-lire  Jack'  had</span><span>  borrowed  his  horse  and  would  return  it  when  he</span><span>  thought  fit  to  do  so.

On  Thurs</span><span>  day  there  was  uo  improvement,  and  the  betting  was</span><span>  in  favour  of  an  adjournment  of  the  races.  About</span><span>  noon,  however,  the  wind  shifted  to  the  west,  and</span><span>  as  evening  advanced  the  moon  broke  through  the</span><span>  clouds,  and  gave  us  the  most  cheering  prospect  of  a</span><span>  return  of  fair  weather.  Yesterday  morning  was</span><span>  bright  and  fair,  the  wind  brisk  and  bracing,  and  as</span><span>  noon  advanced  we  observed  an  additional  tone  in</span><span>  the  conversation  upon  the  weather,  which  increased</span><span>  towards  the  evening,  when  '  every  body's  opinion'</span><span>  was  in  favour  of  a  fair  and  a  merry  meeting.</span><span>  Many  of  the  old  pioneers  of  the  Darling  Downs</span><span>  will  regret  to  learn  of  the  eudden  death  of  Mr  Fred</span><span>  erick  Bracker,  which  took  place  at  Warroo  on  Fri</span><span>  day  last.  Mr  Bracker  was  one  of  the  first  settlers</span><span>  on  the  Macintyre  Brook,  and  his  flock  was  known  for</span><span>  many  years  as  the  best  imported  stock  in  the  Downs</span><span>  district.  About  sixteen  years  ago  Mr  Bracker  de</span><span>  voted  his  attention  to  agriculture,  and  was  so  far</span><span>  successful  that  his  annual  average  of  wheat  seldom</span><span>  went  below  thirty  or  thirty-five  bushels  per  acre,</span><span>  and  usually  met  the  ordinary  requirements  of  the</span><span>  station.  About  sixteen  years  ago  Mr  Bracker  im</span><span>  ported  the  requisite  machinery  for  thrashing  and</span><span>  grinding  bis  corn,  and  the  farm  has  for  many  years</span><span>  presented  one  of  the  most  perfect  models  of  agricul</span><span>  tural  industry  that  could  be  found  in  the  western</span><span>  districts.  The  beardy  spring  wheat  wax  a  great</span><span>  favorite  with  Mr  Bracker,  and  we  believe  it  has  been</span><span>  on  Warroo  for  the  last  eight  or  nine  years  without</span><span>  exhibiting  the  slighest  indication  of  rust.  During</span><span>  the  outcry  of  the  past  season  he  gave  us  the  benefit</span><span>  of  bis  experience,  and  offered  to  supply  some  two  or</span><span>  three  hundred  bushels  to  our  local  farmers  at  a  low</span><span>  rate,  in  order  that  it  might  be  tested  in  this  district.</span><span>  Mr  Bracker  has  left  a  family  of  two  sons  and  three</span><span>  daughters,  who,  we  are  pleased  to  state,  have  been</span><span>  amply  provided  for.</span></p> <p><span>  Aw  advertisement  which  appears  in  another</span><span>  column  informs  us  that  Mr.  Hoskins,  the  talented</span><span>  comedian,  assisted  by  Miss  Florence  Colville  and</span><span>  Mr.  H.

If.  Watson  at  £1  10s</span><span>  per  acre,  and  the  remaining  lots  were  passed  with</span><span>  out  an  offer,  with  the  exception  of  78  and  86,  which</span><span>  were  taken  by  Mr  Alfred  Nash  at  the  upset  prioe  of</span><span>  £4  per  acre.</span><span>  The  death  of  Mr  Phillip  Masterson  was  an</span><span>  nounced  in  the  Kkprets  of  December  8.  Many  of  our</span><span>  readers  will  remember  that  about  the  month  of</span><span>  October,  1869,  Masterson  received  a  very  severe</span><span>  knife  wound  while  endeavouring  to  arrest  a  man</span><span>  named  Johann  Christian,  and  that  the  fellow  was</span><span>  sentenced  to  ten  years'  penal  servitude  at  the  Cir</span><span>  enit  Court,  held  in  Toowoomba  on  tbe  1st  February</span><span>  last  Masterson,  who  wm  for  some  time  in  im</span><span>  minent  danger,  recovered  sufficiently  to  be  sent  to</span><span>  Cleveland.  There  (says  tbe  Bxpreu)  he  seemed  for</span><span>  a  time  to  regain  his  health,  bnt  as  we  are  informed</span><span>  while  bathing  was  bitten  or  stung  in  the  arm,  and</span><span>  had  to  be  removed  to  the  hospital  He  has  been</span><span>  under  treatment  there  some  tune,  and  within  the</span><span>  last  few  days  got  into  a  violent  fever,  and  showed</span><span>  very  dangerous  symptoms,  which  we  regret  to  aay</span><span>  resulted  fatally  yesterday.  His  suberiore  gave</span><span>  Masterson  a  high  character  as  a  well  educated  man,</span><span>  and  «a  efficient  member  of  the  police  force,  and</span></p> <p><span>  Oar  December  8th  we  were  favoured  with  a  ??  sight'</span><span>  of  some  *ery  fine  specimens  of  copper  ore,  obtained</span><span>  astiie  proprietor  Mated  in  tin  neighbourhood  of</span><span>  Dalby,  and  within  a  few  miles  of  tbe  Southern  and</span><span>  Western  Bailwar.

It  is  generally</span><span>  believed  that  the  bruise  on  the  head  was  ruceirud</span><span>  during  the  fall,  aud  that  tlie  boy  was  insensible  on</span><span>  reaching  the  water,  or  unable  to  make  an  effort  to</span><span>  keep  himself  afloat  until  the  arrival  of  assistance.</span><span>  One  of  the  slain  was  found  loose  about  fifteen  feet</span><span>  from  the  top  of  the  well  aud  projecting  ou  one  side</span><span>  to  a  distance  of  about  eight  inches.

Under  the  circum</span><span>  stances,  therefore,  it  would  be  unfair  to  say  that</span><span>  proper  precautions  had  not  been  taken  to  guard</span><span>  agsutst  accident.

It  appears  that  Bonham  was  thrown  from  his</span><span>  horse  while  jumping  a.  log,  and  sustained  n  very</span><span>  severe  laceration  of  the  kidneys.  The  unfortunate</span><span>  young  man  was  conveyed  to  a  settler's  residence  in</span><span>  the  neighbourhood,  where  he  was  immediately  at</span><span>  tended  by  Dr  Becker,  but  we  regret  to  learn  that</span><span>  the  injuries  received  were  of  such  a  character  as  to</span><span>  delay  his  removal  for  Bevi'.ral  days.</span><span>  Till:  tenders  for  the  erection  of  the  Malt-house  at</span><span>  the  Downs  Brewery  were  opened  on  December  IT,</span><span>  and  the  contract  was  given  (conditionally)  to  Mr  J.</span><span>  -iar£ctt,  of  Tnowoumbo.

Colin</span><span>  M'Culloch  at  the  School  of  Arts  on  Thursday,  Dec.</span><span>  15,  the  subject  of  the  lecture  being  'Wanderings</span><span>  in  Italy.  '  The  attendance  was  very  fair  consider</span><span>  ing  tlie  state  of  the  weather,  and  those  persons</span><span>  present  appeared  to  be  enchanted  with  the  vivid</span><span>  word-paintings  of  the  reverend  lecturer.  The.  mar-</span><span>  vellous  beauties  of  the  cathedral  of  Milan,  its</span><span>  solemn  stately  grandeur,  and  the  religious  bearing</span><span>  of  the  people,  were  dwelt  upon  witu  reinarkaVile</span><span>  effect,  while  the  crushing  influence  of  Austrian  rule</span><span>  was  delineated  with  a  power  and  vigour  we  have</span><span>  seldom  witnessed.  The  rev.  gentleman  then  referred</span><span>  to  the  exquisite  taste  exhibited  in  the  street  archi</span><span>  tecture  of  Verona  and  the  iron  guard  formerly  kept</span><span>  over  the  city  by  the  cannon  of  Austria,  and  then</span><span>  went  on  to  describe  the  marble  palaces  and  silent</span><span>  highways  of  beautiful  Venice.  In  conclusion  the</span></p> <p><span>  reverend  lecturer  alluded,  in  feeling  terms,  to  the</span><span>  patriotism  of  the  people  of  Italy  and  the  trials  and</span><span>  sufferings  they  bad  undergone  in  the  struggle  for</span><span>  liberty  and  unity.  A  vote  of  thanks  was  proposed</span><span>  by  Mr  D.  Mclntyre  and  second  by  Mr  Stirling,  after</span><span>  which  it  waB  stated  by  Mr  McCullouh  tbat  he  would</span><span>  on  another  occasion  deliver  a  lecture  upon  liis</span><span>  wanderings  in  Scotland.</span><span>  A  FRIGHTFUL  accident,  which  unhappily  was  at</span><span>  tended  with  fatal  results,  occurred  to  a  young  man</span><span>  named  Michael  Horn  on  Tuesday,  Dec.  20.  It  ap</span><span>  pears  that  Horn  was  assisting  a  neighbour  named</span><span>  Boghert  in  the  erection  of  a  haystack  on  a  small</span><span>  cultivation  near  the  corner  of  Hume  and  Perth</span><span>  streets,  and  at  12  o'clock  was  about  to  descend  for</span><span>  lunch,  Mr  Boghert  went  round  the  stack  for  a</span><span>  ladder,  but  deceased  said  there  was  no  neces</span><span>  sity  for  so  much  trouble,  as  he  could</span><span>  easily  slide  down  the  stack,  which  was</span><span>  only  about  eight  feet  high.  Accordingly  he  sat</span><span>  down  upon  the  rick  and  commenced  his  descent.</span><span>  The  hay  was  scattered  about  the  ground  near  the</span><span>  base  of  the  rick,  and  it  is  supposed  that  deceased</span><span>  intended  to  slide  down  into  one  of  the  heaps</span><span>  which  was  nearest  at  hand,  and  in  doing  so,</span><span>  however,  he  alighted  upon  a  stake  or  stick,</span><span>  which  entered  his  body,  and  caused  almost</span></p> <p><span>  instantaneous  death.  A  post  mortem  examination</span><span>  made  by  Dr.  Roberts  yesterday  evening  disclosed</span><span>  the  fact  that  the  stake  entered  the  scrotum,  passed</span><span>  through  the  body  in  an  upward  direction,  and</span><span>  pierced  the  heart  on  the  left  tide,  death  ensuing</span><span>  from  internal  hemorrhage.  A  magisterial  inquiry</span><span>  will  be  held  at  the  Court  House  this  Wednesday</span><span>  morning  at  10  o'clock.</span><span>  A  MAGISTERIAL  inquiry  was  held  at  the  Court</span><span>  house  on  Friday,  Dec.  16,  touching  the  death  of  a</span><span>  little  boy  named  Peter  Day,  who  met  with  his  death</span><span>  at  Irish  -town  on  Wednesday  last.  From  the  evi</span><span>  dence  given  by  Mrs.  Gleeson  it  appeared  that  the</span><span>  deceased,  with  several  other  children,  was  playing</span><span>  about  a  rick  of  hay  about  ten  or  twelve  yards  from</span><span>  Mrs.  Gleeson'e  residence.  The  children  were  cau</span><span>  tioned  not  to  go  on  the  rick,  but  a  few  minutes</span><span>  afterwards  a  little  girl  named  Mary  Anne  Day  came</span><span>  running  to  the  house  and  said  '  Peter  is  killed,  a</span><span>  log  has  fallen  upon  him.'  The  child  was  found  in</span><span>  sensible  by  the  aide  of  the  rick,  and  a  log,</span><span>  which  had  been  previously  on  the  top,  was</span><span>  lying  on  the  ground  close  to  the  deceased;  the</span><span>  unfortunate  child  never  rallied,  and  died  in  about</span><span>  an  hour  afterwards.  Dr  Roberts  stated  that  he  saw</span><span>  the  deceased  about  half-past  twelve  on  Wednesday</span><span>  afternoon  ;  he  was  quite  insensible  and  extremely</span><span>  depressed  by  the  shock  of  the  accident  ;  there  was</span><span>  a  large  bruise  on  the  top  of  the  head,  and  beneath</span><span>  the  bruise  the  skull  was  fractured  ;  there  was  also</span><span>  a  severe  bruise  on  the  back,  with  internal  injuries</span><span>  on  the  chest;  he  did  not  rally  from  the  shock,  but</span><span>  died  in  less  than  an  hour  afterwards  ;  the  injuries</span><span>  were  such  as  might  have  been  caused  by  a  log  falling</span><span>  upon  him.</span></p> <p><span>  IN  the  Legislative  Assembly  on  Wednesday,  the  19th</span><span>  intant,  the  sum  of  £60,000  was  voted  for  roads  and</span><span>  bridges  in  thee  southern  division  of  the  colony.  Of  this</span><span>  sum  we  find  that  £4000  will  be  devoted  to  the  improve</span><span>  ment  of  the  road  between  Drayton  and  Goondiwindi</span><span>  and  £2660  to  the  roads  in  the  district  of  Drayton</span><span>  and  Toowoomba.  According  to  present  arrange</span><span>  ments  it  is  understood  that  the  expenditure  of  the</span><span>  money  will  be  entrusted  to  local  boards,  road  trusts,</span><span>  and  that  power  will  be  given  to  these  boards  to  levy</span><span>  an  annual  rate  for  the  maintenance  of  roads  within</span><span>  the  districts  assigned  to  their  jurisdiction.</span><span>  It  is  a  matter  of  great  gratification  (says  the</span><span>  Qmnulami  Bxpnu)  Oat  tnelona-wiahed-far  bridge</span><span>  across  the  Brisbane  Biver  is  likely  bow  to  be  soon</span><span>  oammeneen1.

The  railway  station  at  Toowoomba</span><span>  affords  very  insufficient  accommodation  for  that  im</span><span>  portant  town,  which  may  be  called  the  central</span><span>  junction  of  the  Southern  and  Western  line.  There</span><span>  is  a  fine  etitiou-building  at  Laidley,  most  of  the</span><span>  material  for  which  was  imported  from  England,</span><span>  and  it  is  on  quite  too  large  a  scale  for  that  iinim</span><span>  portaut  place.  It  is  stated  that  it  could  be  removed</span><span>  and  re-erected  at  Toowoomba  for  tbe  sum  of  £700.</span><span>  Besides  this,  the  materials  of  a  duplicate  building,</span><span>  also  imported,  are  lying  useless,  a  portion  being  at</span><span>  Ipswich,  and  the  rest  at  Toowoomba.

As  time  elapsed  the  nature  j</span><span>  of  bis  illness  became  more  certain.  On  the  evening</span><span>  of  Saturday,  November  19,  he  suffered  from  increase</span><span>  pressure  on  the  windpipe,  which  rendered  his</span><span>  breathing  more  difficult  ;  however,  lie  passed  sgornl  ,</span><span>  night,  and  felt  much  better  nn  the  morning  of  Sunday,  j</span><span>  November  20,  but  shortly  after  he  be^an  to  cough</span><span>  when  the  aneurism  burst  aud  he  died  a  few  minutes  I</span><span>  later.

It  appear*</span><span>  that  a  poor  woman  named  M'Namara  gave  birth  to</span><span>  twins.  They  lived  only  a  few  days,  and  then  the</span><span>  mother  followed.  I  believe  both  the  o.vnerof  the</span><span>  station  and  friends  in  town  did  all  they  could  for</span><span>  the  unfortunate  woman,  but  it  was  of  no  avail.  I</span><span>  am  told  tbe  father  laid  his  other  children  (3)  fast</span><span>  asleep  alongside  of  their  dead  mother  whilst  he</span><span>  came  into  town—  a  distance  of  four  or  five  miles  —</span><span>  to  report  the  death.  People  preach  and  talk  about</span><span>  the  miseries  of  the  poor  in  Ireland  ;  bnt  where  will</span><span>  yon  find  a  parallel  to  this  fact?</span><span>  The  same  correspondent  writing  at  a  later  date,</span><span>  says,  —  Quite  a  gloom  was  cast  over  our  little  town  on</span><span>  Thursday,  the  10th  instant,  when  it  generally  became</span><span>  known  that  a  young  girl  named  Katie  Brown  had</span><span>  intentionally  poisoned  herself  .

A  few  days  after,</span><span>  Mesaers,  Browne  and  Sullivan  called  at  the  station</span><span>  on  their  way  to  Cnniumulla,  'id  wcro  iuformed</span><span>  that  Mr.  Sharpe  was  in  this  township.  Upou</span><span>  arriving  here  they  expected  to  meet  the  old  gentle</span><span>  man,  but  not  having  aoue  bo,  and  muling  that  he</span><span>  did  not  return  after  bis  departure  here  on  31  st,  it</span></p> <p><span>  was  at  once  surmised  that  the  poor  old  fellow  was</span><span>  lost.  The  police  immediately  (at  8  p.m.)  went  out</span><span>  in  search,  but  the  rain  fell  iu  such  torrents  that</span><span>  night  and  ou  the  following  day  that  their  search  was</span><span>  not  attended  with  any  success.  On  the  following</span><span>  two  days  all  hands  were  out  that  could  possibly  raise</span><span>  a  horse,  together  with  the  police  and  black  trackers,</span><span>  but  no  traces  of  the  poor  old  gentleman,  burst!,  sad</span><span>  dle,  or  bridle  could  lie  found.  All  hands  now  dis</span><span>  paired  of  his  being  again  seen  Alive,  as  he  was  lost</span><span>  tive  clear  days.  Luckily,  however,  on  the  sixth</span><span>  day,  a  carrier  who  was  going  with  loading  from</span><span>  Bourke  to  Eulo,  ou  the  branch  mad  between  the</span><span>  Cuttaburra  and  Mongiiru,  was  out  looking  for  his</span><span>  horses  when  be  saw  a  man,  as  it  appeared  to  him</span><span>  wandering  almost  in  a  circle  a  short  distance  away.</span><span>  At  first  he  was  not  going  to  take  any  notice,  but  ou</span><span>  consideration  he  went  to  see  who  it  vi  us.  When  h</span><span>  came  'Up  Mr  Sharp  was  Bitting  under  a  tree,  per</span><span>  fectly  exhausted,  although  iu  possession  of  all  his</span><span>  faculties.  The  carrier  t.iok  all  possible  care  of  the</span><span>  poor  old  man,  and  I  am  happy  to  hear  that,  although</span><span>  yet  unable  to  move  about,  he  is  fast  recovering  tlie</span><span>  effects  of  his  dreadful  suffering.

We;</span><span>  apprehend  that  it  is  no  more  the  province  of  the  law</span><span>  to  interpose  specially  on  behalf  of  those  who  are</span><span>  morally  aud  socially  ill  at  ease,  than  it  would  Ijc  to'</span><span>  rescue  any  other  class  of  persons  from  the  natural</span><span>  consequences  of  their  own  actions.  There  ib  the</span><span>  stronger  reason  for  insisting  on  this  view  of  the  sub-,</span><span>  ject,  since,  there  aro  growing  symptoms  of  a  ten-'</span><span>  deucy,  on  the  part  of  persons  of  damaged  reputa</span><span>  tion,  to  maintain  their  somewhat  shaky  social  status</span><span>  by  a  species  of  terrorism.  By  t)ie  help'  .of  such</span><span>  decisions  as  the  one  we  have  commented  on,-  this</span><span>  sort  of  thing  may  be  made  to  pay  its  own  way,  and</span><span>  yield  a  good  profit  besides.

Although  residing'  amongst  you  since  a  boy  I  feel</span><span>  (fiat  it  is  necessary  to  state  plainly  to  you  what  my</span><span>  ?olitical  opinions  are.</span><span>  'With  regard  to  the  repeal  of  the  Two-thirds</span><span>  ?ause,  I  am  of  opinion  that  the  Constitution  Act</span><span>  Ait  at  present  stands  is  simply  a  damper  on  '  pro</span><span>  gress;'  and,  although  opposed  to  hstty  legislation,</span><span>  I  consider  that  an  anti-progressive  minority  should</span><span>  nover  be  placed  in  a  position  to  defeat  the  wellcon</span><span>  sidered  programme  of  a  progressive  majority.  I</span><span>  therefore  heartily  support  the  repeal  of-  the  Two</span><span>  thirds  Clause  as  a  necessary  precursor  of  a  progres</span><span>  sive  and  liberal  policy.</span><span>  Whilst  acknowledging  the  claims  of  property  and</span><span>  education  tn  representation  in  the  councils  of  the</span><span>  people,  I  mast  also  acknowledge  that  the  only</span><span>  approximately  fair  basis  that  I  see  for  representa</span><span>  tion  is  population,  considering  that  it  the  rising</span><span>  generation  are  not  sufficiently  educated  to  be  safely</span><span>  entrusted  with  the  franchise  it  is  the  fault  of  those</span><span>  who  ought  to  know  better.  On  these  grounds  I</span><span>  heartily  agree  with  the  system  of  free  education</span><span>  :  introduced  by  MrLajey's  Ministry,  at  the  same  time</span><span>  that  I  deprecate  the  expenditure  of  public  funds</span><span>  without  Parliamentary  authority.  I  may,  however,</span><span>  remark  that  whilst  the  franchise  is  within  the  reach</span><span>  of  every  industrious  and  saving  man  I  would  not</span><span>  support  anything  like  '  Manhood  Suffrage,'  I</span><span>  would  be  decidedly  in  favor  of  an  amended  system</span><span>  of  collecting  Hie  names  of  those  qualified  to  be  on</span><span>  the  electoral  rolL</span><span>  On  the  subject  of  railway  extension,  I  am  in  farr  r</span><span>  of  the  immediate  extension  of  the  railway  from</span><span>  Ipswich  to  Brisbane  ;  funds  for  the  same  to  lie  raised</span><span>  by  Government  loan  ;  the  terminus  at  Brisbane  to</span><span>  be  so  placed  as  to  allow  of  the  line  being  carried  on</span><span>  to  the  Bay,  in  case  it  is  found  more  advantageous  to</span><span>  form  a  port  there  than  to  remove  the  obstructions  to</span><span>  the  navigation  of  a  river.  1  am  also  in  favour  of</span><span>  any  well-considered  plan  for  the  extension  of  the</span><span>  railways  into  the  interior,  both  South  and  North,</span><span>  cither  upon  the  guarantee  system,  if  it  can  be  done</span><span>  without  too  far  pledging  the  geueral  revenue  of  the</span><span>  colony,  or  better  still  on  the  American  system  of</span><span>  large  land  bonuses  to  companies  unilertakuig  the</span><span>  work.</span><span>  1  am  strongly  in  favor  of  immigration  of  the  class</span><span>  ?required^</span><span>  As  long  as  it  is  necessary  to  raise  a  revenue  by</span><span>  ad  valorem  duties,  I  am  in  favor  of  their  being</span><span>  placed  equally  on  all  articles  introduced  into  the</span><span>  colony,  but  I  am  entirely  opposed  to  Protection.</span><span>  I  consider  that  the  qaestion  of  Law  Reform  is  of</span><span>  great  importance,  and  would  support  any  measure</span><span>  to  simplify  its  administration,  and  to  remove  those</span><span>  intricacies  which  afford  an  opportunity  for  the  edu</span><span>  cated  knave  to  rob  the  honest  man.  Amongst  other</span><span>  lows  which  require  a  thorough  reform  are  those</span><span>  relating  to  insolvency,  which,  at  present,  whilst</span><span>  punishing  only  the  extremely  thick-fingered  rogucr</span><span>  inolode  aU  others  in  the  same  oatagory  as  the  heuest</span><span>  but  unfortunate  trader.  I  consider  also  that  a  hill</span><span>  should  be  passed  for  shifting  juries.  I  would  also</span><span>  support  a  ineasuie  to  save  the  working  man's  wages</span><span>  from  the  hands  of  banks  and  other  mortgagees.</span><span>  Although  not  in  a  position  to  go  to  any  expense</span><span>  in  securing  my  return;  1  trust  to  be  able  to  meet</span><span>  you  in  various  parts  of  the  eleotorate,  whes  I  will</span><span>  more  fully  explain  my  views  ;  and  in  conclusion,  I</span><span>  may  state  that  if  you  do  me  the  honor  to  return  me</span><span>  as  your  representative  I  shall  always  seek  to  for</span><span>  ward  the  interests  of  your  district  as  far  as  they</span><span>  are  consonant  with  the  general  welfare  of  the</span><span>  colony.</span><span>  I  have  the  honor  to  bcr</span><span>  Gentlemen,</span><span>  Your  olwdient  servant,</span><span>  EDWARD  WILMOT  PKCHEY.</span><span>  To  the  Electors  of  the  Western  Downs.</span><span>  g~V  ENTLEMEN,—  In  coming  forward  as  a  candi</span><span>  VJT  date  for  the  honor  of  representing  you  in  the</span><span>  Legislative  Asaembly,  I  will  briefly  lay  before  you</span><span>  my  opinions  on  a  few  of  the  questions  that  are  likely</span><span>  to  lie  decided  by  the  next  Parliament.</span><span>  I  am  opposed  te-any  further  construction  of  rail</span><span>  ways,  either  by  loan  or  the  guarantee  system,  until</span><span>  the  state  of  our  finances  is  such  as  to  show  that  the</span><span>  country  might  safely  go  on  with  them  without</span><span>  crippling  its  resources.  Our  launching  at  present</span><span>  into  any  extensive  railway  policy  will  most  surely</span><span>  lead  to  greatly  increased  taxation,  without  giving</span><span>  in  return  anything  like  an  equivalent  benefit  to  the</span><span>  community.  .</span><span>  With  regard  to  the  question  of  protection,  I  am</span><span>  firmly  of  opinion  that  a  protective  tariff  would  be</span><span>  prejudicial  to  the  true  interests  of  this  Colony,  would</span><span>  tend  only  to  divert  capital  and  labour  from  present</span><span>  profitable  employments  into  artificial  channels</span><span>  '  bolstered  up  at  the  expense  of  the  whole  community,</span><span>  and  also  would  most  certainly  enhance  the  cost  of</span><span>  production  of  everything  raised  in  the  country.</span><span>  The  present  system  of  forced  immigration  I  do</span><span>  not  believe  in.  If  you  will  consider  the  sul-ject,you</span><span>  muBt  perceive  that  it  simpry  means  paying  from</span><span>  your  own  pockets  the  passages  of  people  to  the</span><span>  colony  to  compete  with  you  in  every  branch  of  life,</span><span>  to  bring  down  the  rate  of  wages  of  the  working</span><span>  classes,  to  overdo  farming  so  that  agricultural  pro</span><span>  duce  will  be  a  drug  in  the  market,  and  to  lower  the</span><span>  individual  prosperity  of  the  great  bulk  of  the  people</span><span>  for  the  benefit  of  a  few  Brisbane  shopkeepers  and</span><span>  landowners.  What  the  country  wants  is  an  iinnii</span><span>  gration  scheme  on  a  small  scale,  through  which  the</span><span>  present  colonists  would  be  assisted  to  bring  out  such</span><span>  of  their  friends  and  relatives  as  wished  to  join  them.</span><span>  Strenuous  exertions  should  be  made  to  get  the</span><span>  roads  in  this  district  and  throughout  the  colony  put</span><span>  into  a  passable  condition  ;  and  I  decidedly  think</span><span>  that  the  great  advantage  of  telegraphic  communica</span><span>  tion  should  be  at  once  conceded  to  the  very  consider</span><span>  able  population  settled  about  GoondiwiuoX</span><span>  I  am,  Gentlemen,</span><span>  Your  obedient  servant,</span><span>  EDWAHD  W1ENH0LT.</span><span>  Jondsryan,  6th  Angnst,  1870.</span><span>  To  the  Electors  of  Western  Downs.</span><span>  /~1  ENTLEMEN,—  In  compliance  with  a  numer</span><span>  VJT  ously  signed  requisition,  I  have  the  honor  to</span><span>  ofter  von  my  services  as  a  candidate  for  election  as</span><span>  one  of  your  repnsentatives-t  the  approaching  elec</span><span>  tion.</span><span>  At  this  election  you  are  eaHed  »poo  t©  eheeee  a</span><span>  representative  at  the  raostimportaut  crisis  the  colony</span><span>  has  experienced;  and,  as  a  candidate  for  your  suf</span><span>  frage.1  ass  prepared  to  submit  for  your  careful  oon</span><span>  sideratutt  the  following  questions  r—</span><span>  1st.
